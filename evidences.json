    "The video of a German man cutting all of his possessions in half to give to his ex-wife after a bitter divorce is fake. The video that went viral last week, and was picked up by many media organizations (including Global News), was a marketing stunt by the German Bar Association.",
    "The story of the German man who sawed his possessions in half tapped into a common human desire for justice and vindication in the face of loss and betrayal. The video and accompanying news stories used dramatic imagery and a sensationalist tone to capture the attention of viewers and readers. The story played on peopleâ€™s emotions, particularly anger and sympathy, and presented a powerful message about the consequence of material possessions."
