    "On the evening of 13 November 2015, about 1,500 concertgoers were watching the California rock band Eagles of Death Metal at the Bataclan theatre in central Paris. At the beginning it was “a great show”, fans reported afterwards. Youngsters were dancing in the pit in front of the stage and on the balcony; some were buying drinks at the bar. On Friday, for the first time, a French court heard audio recordings and saw photographs of what happened next. There was silence as the court was played three sound recordings from the Bataclan attack, one of a series of bombings and shootings across Paris that killed 130 people and injured more than 300.",

    "A woman has described her horror and fear as she pretended to be dead, amid the victims, for more than an hour as gunmen stalked Paris’s Bataclan theatre during Friday night’s attack, in which more than 80 people were murdered. Isobel Bowdery said she survived the attack by lying still and trying to hold her breath. In a Facebook post, she paid tribute to the people she said tried to comfort her and to those who died."
