    "[title]: Actor Leonardo DiCaprio testifies in money laundering and bribery trial ...\npublish date: 2023-04-03 00:00:00\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio testified in a federal court on Monday morning as part of a trial involving international money laundering, bribery and a prominent rap artist.\n\nPrakazrel “Pras” Michel – a founding member of the iconic 1990s hip-hop group, The Fugees – is accused of funneling money from a fugitive Malaysian financier through straw donors to Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign. Five years later, prosecutors say he tried to squelch an investigation into that same financier under Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nAt the heart of the case is Low Taek Jho, usually known as Jho Low. He is accused of masterminding an international money laundering and bribery scheme that stole billions from the Malaysian state investment fund known as 1MDB.\n\nDiCaprio’s connection with the case comes from his years-long relationship with Low, who was one of the primary financiers of the movie The Wolf of Wall Street. Low is currently a fugitive but has maintained his innocence.\n\nAccording to the charges, Michel essentially became a conduit for Low’s pilfered millions and his attempts to influence the US government. Prosecutors allege that from June to November 2012, Low directed more than $21.6m to be moved from foreign entities to Michel’s accounts in order to funnel money into the 2012 presidential election. They say Michel then paid about 20 straw donors and conduits so they could make the donations in their names and conceal where the money actually came from, according to the indictment.\n\nDiCaprio testified that he met and befriended Low at a birthday party in Las Vegas in 2010. “I understood him to be a huge businessman with many different connections in Abu Dhabi and Malaysia,” he said.\n\nThe 48-year-old Oscar winner answered questions on the witness stand calmly – occasionally deferring to a fuzzy memory on some details and dates. In addition to his relationship with Low, DiCaprio said he had known the defendant Michel since sometime in the 199",
    "[title]: FBI grilled Leonardo DiCaprio over ties to Malaysian fugitive financier ...\npublish date: 2023-03-03 00:00:00\n\nNew details have emerged of the actor Leonardo DiCaprio’s ties to Jho Low, the Malaysian financier turned fugitive currently wanted by international authorities over his links to one of the world’s largest corruption scandals.\n\nOn Thursday, Bloomberg revealed previously undisclosed details from FBI documents in which authorities interviewed DiCaprio in 2018 about his relationship with Low, who is accused of involvement in a money-laundering scheme of over $4.5bn being siphoned from the Malaysian state investment fund, also known as 1MDB.\n\nDiCaprio met Low at a nightclub in 2010 and went on to establish a close relationship, according to the report.\n\n“I was working for him … and that business also translates into being social. And so we saw each other more, and there was more interaction,” DiCaprio told a grand jury, according to the report.\n\nThe two had at one point discussed ideas for a $1bn mega-fund for more film-making, as well as a Warner Bros theme park in Asia with rides based on DiCaprio’s movies. DiCaprio and Low also discussed the development of an eco-friendly resort in Belize.\n\nAccording to the report, DiCaprio introduced Low as “my man” while Low called DiCaprio “L-Dogg”. The two have also met each other’s mothers, the report said.\n\nIn addition to Low financing the 2013 Oscar-nominated movie The Wolf of Wall Street, which DiCaprio starred in, Low also showered DiCaprio with various luxury gifts. Among those were Marlon Brandon’s $600,000 Oscar statue, as well as a $9m Jean-Michel Basquiat painting, according to the report.\n\nAccording to a 2018 New York Times report, DiCaprio returned those gifts to authorities following investigations into Low’s alleged siphoning of billions of dollars from the Malaysian fund.\n\nIn his interviews with the FBI, DiCaprio said that he had been told that Low’s wealth hailed from an unknown “whale of whales” in Abu Dhabi, and that Low was the “Mozart of the business world”.\n\nThe Bloomberg re",
    "[title]: Leonardo DiCaprio, the Malaysian Money Scandal and His \"Unusual ...\npublish date: 2016-08-17 07:25:00+00:00\n\nOn the evening of July 20, under a tent at a vineyard in St. Tropez brimming to his specifications with booze, billionaires and babes, Leonardo DiCaprio was preparing to host one of the glitziest charitable events of the year: the third annual fundraiser for his Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation. Earlier that same day, under far less glamorous auspices half a world away, the U.S. Department of Justice was filing a complaint with the U.S. District Court in downtown Los Angeles that suggested the recent Oscar winner is a bit player in the planet’s largest embezzlement case, totaling more than $3 billion siphoned from a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund called 1MDB.\n\nWhile the complaint does not target DiCaprio — he’s referred to twice in the 136-page document and only as “Hollywood Actor 1” — the scandal shines an unfamiliar light on the charitable foundation of the most powerful actor in Hollywood thanks to the way the LDF has benefited directly from DiCaprio’s relationship with key figures in the saga. And much like the gala in St. Tropez, with its expressions of one-percenter excess ostensibly in support of saving the environment (guests helicoptering in to dine on whole sea bass after watching a short film about the dangers of overfishing), a closer look at the LDF itself raises questions about its ties to the 1MDB players as well as the lack of transparency often required (or offered in this case) for the specific structure the actor has chosen for his endeavor.\n\n\n\nFrom left: Constance Jablonski, Joan Smalls, Doutzen Kroes, Lily Donaldson and Anja Rubik were photographed just before the July 20 Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation gala in St. Tropez.\n\nSet up not as a nonprofit but instead as a donor-advised fund (DAF) attached to the California Community Foundation, which is a nonprofit, the LDF therefore is not required to file itemized public disclosures about its own revenue, expenditures and disbursements. “It’s difficult to characte",

    "[title]: Leonardo DiCaprio cooperating with the DOJ on Malaysian ... - CBS News\npublish date: None\n\nLOS ANGELES -- Leonardo DiCaprio says he’s awaiting direction from the U.S. Justice Department regarding any ill-gotten funds that may have supported his environmental foundation or 2013 film “The Wolf of Wall Street.”\n\nThe Oscar-winning actor released a statement through his representatives Tuesday saying he will return any gifts or donations connected to a Malaysian wealth fund, pending a fraud investigation of that fund by the U.S. and other countries. Court filings in connection with the investigations allege a complex money laundering scheme intended to enrich top-level officials of the Malaysian government-controlled wealth fund.\n\n“Both Mr. DiCaprio and (the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation) continue to be entirely supportive of all efforts to assure that justice is done in this matter,” the statement said. “Mr. DiCaprio is grateful for the lead and instruction of the government on how to accomplish this.”\n\nThe Justice Department says that at least $3.5 billion has been stolen from the wealth fund, known as 1MDB, by people close to Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. Najib created the fund in 2009 shortly after he took office to promote economic development projects in the Asian nation, but the fund accumulated billions in debts over the years.\n\nThe Justice Department has initiated action to seize $1.3 billion it says was taken from the fund to buy assets in the U.S., including luxury properties in New York and California, a $35 million jet, art by Vincent Van Gogh and Claude Monet, and financing of “The Wolf of Wall Street,” according to federal government complaints filed in Los Angeles in July.\n\nThe government complaints also say that more than $700 million has landed in the accounts of “Malaysian Official 1.” They didn’t name the official, but appear to be referring to Najib.\n\nThe Justice Department complaints also do not mention DiCaprio by name, but make an oblique reference to “Hollywood Actor 1,” who during his Golden Globe acceptance"
