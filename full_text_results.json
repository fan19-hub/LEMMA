Made up. Fake. We went through the same stories. You could have asked me the same questions four years ago. I had to litigate this and talk about it. Totally fake news. No.”\n\nThen, he deflected blame, attempting to cast doubts about the legitimacy of the report with his own false claim.\n\n“Actually, I paid tax, but – and you’ll see that as soon as my tax returns – it’s under audit,” he said. “They’ve been under audit for a long time.”\n\nBut his own Internal Revenue Service has clarified that the president does not have to wait for the results of his audit before he releases his tax returns.\n\nHis rebuttal follows a familiar pattern to undermine press reports by denying them, deflecting blame and using the same allegations against his perceived enemies.\n\nSince the phrase first appeared on his Twitter feed in December 2016 through the firs",
    "[title]: Trump Is Gone, but the Media's Misinformation Challenge Is Still Here\npublish date: 2021-07-27 00:00:00\n\nInside a room at the Cannon House Office Building on Tuesday, witnesses testified to their experience on Jan. 6, when an armed mob egged on by President Donald J. Trump breached the Capitol. It eventually reached the Senate chamber, where senators had been certifying Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory under the gavel of Vice President Mike Pence, whom some of the rioters chanted that they wanted to hang.\n\nBut outside the room, prominent Republicans have painted a very different, significantly misleading picture of that day.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Representative Elise Stefanik of New York falsely blamed Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, for the breach, saying she had ignored evidence that the Capitol’s security might be compromised in favor of her own “partisan political optics.”\n\nLast month, Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a leading G.O.P. purveyor of misinformation, downplayed the attack with the false claim that the rioters had stayed “within the rope lines” inside the Capitol.",
    "[title]: Trump versus the truth: The most outrageous falsehoods of his presidency\npublish date: None\n\nPresident Donald Trump spent his first days in office pushing false claims about the size of his inauguration crowd.\n\nHe has spent the final weeks of his term blitzing the American people with falsehoods and far-fetched conspiracies as part of a failed attempt to overturn the election he lost — cementing his legacy as what fact checkers and presidential historians say is the most mendacious White House occupant ever.\n\n“I have never seen a president in American history who has lied so continuously and so outrageously as Donald Trump, period,” presidential historian Michael Beschloss said in an interview. “Dwight Eisenhower used to say one of the most important tools a president of the United States has is that people believe what he says.\"\n\nBut that belief in the president’s words has become increasingly dependent on the political party to which a person belongs. Trump decries reports that are unflattering and facts that don’t fit with his world view as “fake news,” fueling a growing partisan information divide on everything from the contagiousness of the coronavirus to the reliability of the media.\n\nTrump’s run for the presidency was fueled by political prominence gained by promoting the racist “birther” lie about President Barack Obama, and his 2016 victory was secured by a campaign rooted in false claims about immigrants and inner-city crime.\n\nOnce in the White House, the president routinely made false claims about everything from toilet flushes to tax reform. Some of Trump’s false claims drove policy, while conspiracy theories were elevated in tweets and in public and private conversations with foreign leaders.\n\nIn the last year of his term, Trump’s countless false claims about the coronavirus muddied the U.S. response to the pandemic, which has killed 339,062 people as of Dec. 29, according to an NBC News count. The president’s utterly baseless claim that the election was stolen from him delayed President-elect Joe Biden’s transition for week",
    "[title]: Canada's defence minister reacts to Trump's NATO comments - CTV News\npublish date: 2024-02-13 07:34:00-05:00\n\nCanada’s defence minister chose his words carefully when asked to respond to Donald Trump’s suggestion the U.S. might not protect those NATO allies not spending enough on defence from Russia.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about Trump’s latest rhetoric, Bill Blair told a pack of journalists in Ottawa on Monday, “I don't think we need to overreact, but I think we need to make sure we are prepared and keep our alliances strong.”\n\nComments made by Trump at the South Carolina rally over the weekend stoked fears of what a second term as U.S. president could mean for the NATO alliance.\n\nCanada, and other countries who are falling short on their NATO defence spending commitments, learned that a second Trump presidential term could result in Russia being shown an open door for any potential invasion.\n\nSpeaking to supporters on Saturday, Trump mused that “one of the presidents of a big country” asked him if they would still be protected if they didn’t pay their way as a NATO member. Trump claims that he told them, “I would not protect you, in fact I would encourage them (Russia) to do whatever the hell they want.”\n\nThe White House called Trump's comments “appalling and unhinged.\"\n\nCanada's military spending has historically lagged behind the majority of NATO members. The federal government is forecast to spend 1.43 per cent of its GDP on defence by 2024-25, falling short of its two per cent commitment.\n\nIs Trump’s messaging wrong?\n\nProf. Jane Boulden with the Centre for International Defence at Queens University said the core of Trump's message isn’t wrong, “NATO allies who are not meeting their two per cent target should do more to meet that target.”\n\nBlair declined to directly answer if Canada would look to increase NATO spending in the event of a second Trump term.\n\n“There is a political election and debate going on in another country, we're going to hear rhetorical statements,” said Blair. “The best deterrent to a bully is strength an"
