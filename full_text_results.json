    "[title]: What's known about claim that white supremacists shot at Ferguson, Mo ...\npublish date: 2021-11-19 00:00:00\n\nBush did not respond to press inquiries to provide evidence for her claim.\n\nThere are accounts from protesters who said the shootings did happen. A woman who recorded Ferguson protests told a St. Louis newspaper she recalled that multiple gunshots were fired at an event for Brown that she attended in January 2015. Another woman said on Facebook she was grazed by a bullet in the incident and gave it to an officer, but police said they had no record.\n\nFormer Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said no such incidents occurred. The current chief said he is not aware of any record of such shootings.\n\nThe day before a jury in Wisconsin began deliberations that would result in the acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse on homicide charges, Missouri’s first Black congresswoman made a years-after-the-fact claim about protests that followed the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown.\n\nBrown was killed in 2014 in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb, in a case that sparked the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nBush, a St. Louis Democrat, tweeted her account on Nov. 15, 2021. She wrote:\n\n\"When we marched in Ferguson, white supremacists would hide behind a hill near where Michael Brown Jr. was murdered and shoot at us. They never faced consequences. If Kyle Rittenhouse gets acquitted, it tells them that even 7 years later they still can get away with it.\"\n\nOn Nov. 19, a jury found Rittenhouse not guilty on all felony counts.\n\nA grand jury in the Ferguson case decided not to indict the officer, Darren Wilson, who later resigned from the department.\n\nProtests over Brown’s death were sometimes chaotic but, while Bush’s claim suggests marchers were repeatedly shot at, incidents of alleged gunfire at marchers were not widely reported.\n\nWe found accounts differed about whether shootings happened as Bush said they did, so we’re not rating this claim.\n\nHere’s what we know.\n\nBrown shooting set off protests\n\nBrown, a Black teen, was unarmed when he was shot to death by Wilson,",
    "[title]: Ferguson Police Clashes with Protesters - People.com\npublish date: None\n\nProtests in Ferguson, Missouri, turned contentious on Sunday night when police charged the demonstrators, using batons and pepper spray to subdue them.\n\nAccording to Newsweek, a large crowd gathered outside the Ferguson Police Department headquarters to protest the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed Black 18-year-old who had been shot and killed by an officer in 2014. The protests came on the sixth anniversary of Brown's death.\n\nAccording to a tweet by St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter Rachel Rice, protestors blocked traffic and danced in the street in front of the headquarters. Some demonstrators may have moved a temporary gate from the front of police headquarters. Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr., was on the scene, according to Rice.\n\nPolice officers in full riot gear later faced off against protesters. Eventually, they advanced towards the crowd.\n\n\"Police just told protesters to move back, and then police advanced and sprayed pepper spray,\" Rice tweeted, along with a video of the scene. \"Bottles were thrown after the advance.\"\n\nOne of the protestors posted a video on YouTube showing the chaos of the scene.\n\nBrown was fatally shot on Aug. 8, 2014, during an altercation with the police. His body was left in the street for four hours.\n\nThe incident sparked protests in the city and led to nationwide discussions over systemic racism and police brutality. At the time, critics called the slaying an act of racial prejudice, but Wilson — who resigned from the force in November 2014 — said he acted in self-defense.\n\nIn late 2014, a grand jury chose not to indict Wilson. The following year, the U.S. Department of Justice found insufficient evidence to prosecute Wilson and formally closed the investigation it conducted, stating in an 86-page report: “Wilson fired at Brown in what appeared to be self-defense and stopped firing once Brown fell to the ground.”\n\nBrown's family filed a civil lawsuit against the city of Ferguson under Missouri's wrongful death",

    "[title]: DOJ Report Vindicates Ferguson Protesters As Police Department Faces ...\npublish date: 2015-03-05 03:38:33+00:00\n\nFERGUSON, Mo. -- The federal government on Wednesday called for a massive overhaul of the law enforcement practices of this St. Louis suburb in a scathing report that found the city regularly engaged in unconstitutional practices that had the heaviest impact on Ferguson’s black residents.\n\nThe long-anticipated report detailed systemic issues with the Ferguson Police Department and its municipal court, and provided accounts of individual incidents, many based on police reports authored by Ferguson officers. The report lends force to the complaints of protesters and some Ferguson residents, who have long said the city treated them as sources of revenue rather than citizens to be protected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a briefing with reporters on Wednesday, a Justice Department official expressed confidence that Ferguson could implement a lengthy list of necessary reforms. The official said the city cooperated with the DOJ investigation, and a meeting with Ferguson officials on Tuesday was not adversarial.\n\nBut the public reaction of Ferguson officials to the damning report left unclear what will happen next. Mayor James Knowles III made a brief statement before cameras on Wednesday night, announcing that one Ferguson employee who sent racist emails mentioned in the report had been fired, and two other employees who sent racist emails were on leave.\n\nYet Knowles, who appeared without police Chief Tom Jackson or other city officials, gave no indication that his government would continue to cooperate with federal civil rights officials. And the racist emails, though disturbing, were only a minor component of the lengthy federal report, which called into question the city’s entire approach to policing and the enforcement of its municipal code.\n\nThe report raises the question of whether the Ferguson will continue to operate its own police department or instead contract with another law enforcement agency. Ferguson is one of the smallest citi"
