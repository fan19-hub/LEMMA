The account was started at the beginning of October.\n\nThe suspect was still being questioned by police on Sunday night after he is alleged to have stabbed the German-Filipino tourist to death and wounded two others – one British, one French.\n\nRajabpour-Miyandoab, who had served four years in prison for planning a radical Islamist attack before being released in 2020, had been monitored by the intelligence services for “persistent radicalisation”, Ricard said, and had undergone psychiatric treatment.\n\nBorn in 1997 in the affluent town of Neuilly-sur-Seine, west of Paris, Rajabpour-Miyandoab was born to parents of Iranian origin, in a family described by the prosecutor as having “no religious engagement”.

France is on its highest alert for attacks against the background of the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nThe prosector said the alleged attacker first targeted three peopl",

He was then chased by police and attacked two other people with a hammer before being arrested.\n\nThe suspect had shouted out \"Allahu Akbar\" (God is greatest) and told police he was upset because \"so many Muslims are dying in Afghanistan and in Palestine\" and was also upset about the Gaza situation, Darmanin said.\n\nThe anti-terrorism prosecutor's office said it was in charge of the investigation.\n\nSaturday night's incident in central Paris occurred less than eight months before the French capital hosts the Olympic Games and could raise questions about security at the global sporting event.\n\nParis plans an unprecedented opening ceremony on the Seine river that may draw as many as 600,000 spectators."
