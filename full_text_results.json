    "[title]: France Covered Up Torture and Mutilation of Bataclan Victims\npublish date: 2016-07-15 14:48:22\n\nClaim: France deliberately suppressed information about torture and mutilation at the Bataclan in November 2015 to avoid upsetting Muslims. Rating: About this rating False\n\nOn 14 July 2016, scores of people were killed in Nice, France, when a large truck plowed through a Bastille Day crowd. This terror attack took place just eight months after a series of coordinated terrorist attacks hit Paris and claimed the lives of 130 people, 89 of whom were killed at the Bataclan nightclub.\n\nAs the world reacted in grief and horror to the Nice trgaedy, both Fox News and Britain's Daily Mail newspaper published articles reporting that France affirmatively covered up unspeakable acts of torture that occurred at the Bataclan on the night of the November 2015 attacks. A headline published by the latter sensationally asserted that France (then grieving) purposely covered up the worst details of what was by all accounts unbridled horror:\n\nAfter repeating most of the rumors as if they were fact, the paper added that \"prosecutors at the parliamentary inquiry into the Bataclan deaths have cast doubt over the claims after revealing that no sharp knives were found at the scene.\" Fox News (aggregating from a separate source) similarly framed the rumors as fact:\n\nA French government committee has heard testimony, suppressed by the French government at the time and not published online until this week, that the killers in the Bataclan tortured their victims on the second floor of the club. The chief police witness in Parliament said that an investigating officer, tears streaming down his face, rushed out of the Bataclan and vomited in front of him just after seeing the disfigured bodies. According to this testimony, Wahhabist killers apparently gouged out eyes, castrated victims, and shoved their testicles in their mouths. They may also have disemboweled some poor souls. Women were stabbed in the genitals — and the torture was, victims told police, filmed ",
    "[title]: French court plays tapes of Bataclan killings at survivor's request\npublish date: 2022-04-01 00:00:00\n\nOn the evening of 13 November 2015, about 1,500 concertgoers were watching the California rock band Eagles of Death Metal at the Bataclan theatre in central Paris. At the beginning it was “a great show”, fans reported afterwards. Youngsters were dancing in the pit in front of the stage and on the balcony; some were buying drinks at the bar.\n\nOn Friday, for the first time, a French court heard audio recordings and saw photographs of what happened next. There was silence as the court was played three sound recordings from the Bataclan attack, one of a series of bombings and shootings across Paris that killed 130 people and injured more than 300.\n\nThe first recording was of the moment three gunmen carrying automatic rifles, their faces covered, entered the venue as the band was playing the song Kiss the Devil and a guitar solo was under way. The terrorists had shot at the doorman and people smoking outside, walked inside the concert hall and paused. Then the massacre began.\n\nThe music dwindled to a few guitar riffs as volley after volley of shots rang out followed by an interminable series of single shots. There was the sound of confusion but surprisingly few screams. The second was a largely inaudible recording of the hostage taking, including the voice of one of those who survived. The third was of the police raid that brought the siege to an end.\n\nView image in fullscreen A commemorative plaque and flowers outside the Bataclan concert hall.

From the packed rows of “civil parties” –",

    "[title]: Bataclan attack: 'Everyone was dancing and smiling, and then men began ...\npublish date: 2015-11-16 00:00:00\n\nA woman has described her horror and fear as she pretended to be dead, amid the victims, for more than an hour as gunmen stalked Paris’s Bataclan theatre during Friday night’s attack, in which more than 80 people were murdered.\n\nIsobel Bowdery said she survived the attack by lying still and trying to hold her breath. In a Facebook post, she paid tribute to the people she said tried to comfort her and to those who died.\n\nAnd she sought to comfort the victims’ families, telling them that she was not afraid in what she believed would be her final moments, but was thinking of her loved ones.\n\nYou never think it will happen to you. It was just a Friday night at a rock show. The atmosphere was so happy and everyone was dancing and smiling. and then when the men came through the front entrance and began the shooting, we naively believed it was all part of the show.\n\nBowdery said she saw people around her fall and the reactions of people inside the theatre.\n\nIt wasn’t just a terrorist attack, it was a massacre. Dozens of people were shot right in front of me. Pools of blood filled the floor. Cries of grown men who held their girlfriends dead bodies pierced the small music venue. Futures demolished, families heartbroken. In an instant.\n\nAnd she described how she managed to survive.\n\nShocked and alone, I pretended to be dead for over an hour, lying among people who could see their loved ones motionless. Holding my breath, trying to not move, not cry – not giving those men the fear they longed to see. I was incredibly lucky to survive. But so many didn’t. The people who had been there for the exact same reasons as I – to have a fun Friday night were innocent. This world is cruel. And acts like this are suppose to highlight the depravity of humans and the images of those men circuling us like vultures will haunt me for the rest of my life. The way they meticulously aimed at shot people around the standing area I was in the centre of without an"
