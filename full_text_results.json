    "[title]: Nazi-smuggling submarine found in Argentina causes international stir\npublish date: None\n\nAfter a suspected World War II submarine was discovered in Argentinian waters in 2022, confidential government documents secured by British investigative journalist Laurence de Mello present the possibility of a Nazi smuggling route created by the United States in partnership with Argentina, according to a May report.\n\nThe sub, which was found near the beaches of Costa Bonita and Arenas Verdes, has the potential to confirm theories that Nazis escaped to Argentina toward the end of the war.\n\nHowever, de Mello explained that the Argentinian government has failed to provide any transparency in their investigative attempts to identify the sub. Rather, according to her, Argentina has refused to publicly identify the ship which cost the government $300,000 to investigate.\n\nThe investigation was meant to identify the sub’s origin, the date that it sank and whether there were any passengers of significant military interest aboard at the time of sinking.\n\nArgentina's security ministry reportedly halted all investigations after receiving an independent report of the wreck, despite the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea legally requiring that the wreck be returned to the country of origin.

    "[title]: Nazi hunters demand Argentina end silence about 'U-boat' discovery\npublish date: 2023-06-22 09:18:34+01:00\n\nThe world's top Nazi hunters are demanding the truth about a wrecked 'submarine' alleged to have helped Hitler escape to Argentina.\n\nThe 80m-long wreck was found near Quequén, a port in central Argentina, by the Eslabón Perdido (Missing Link) research group.\n\nAnd their leader, Abel Basti, believes it was a Nazi submarine that may have carried Hitler to a new life in South America, despite the widely accepted view by most historians that he killed himself in his Berlin bunker in April 1945.\n\nGovernment divers examined the wreck after its discovery was confirmed last year, but their findings remain shrouded in mystery.\n\nNow the Simon Wiesenthal Center – named for the famed Nazi hunter whose work it continues – is calling for Buenos Aires to end its 'suspicious' silence.\n\nGerman U-boat U-530 at Mar del Plata after its surrender in 1945 in Quequen, Buenos Aires.

Photo: Prefectura Naval Argentina\n\nBy LAURENCE DE MELLO IN BUENOS AIRES\n\n\n\nThe 2022 discovery of a suspected WWII U-boat in Argentine waters has ignited an intense political debate within the closed corridors of the Argentine Government, resuscitating embarrassing historical ties between President General Juan Domingo Peron and Nazi Germany.\n\nThe shattered amphibious craft, lying in shallow waters close to the beaches of Costa Bonita and Arenas Verdes off the coast of Buenos Aires, could confirm claims that leading Nazi’s escaped to Argentina by submarine in the closing months of WWII.\n\nNews of the shipwreck and the subsequent reluctance by the Argentine Government to conclude a transparent investigation to identify the vessel, has prompted congressional members of the political opposition party 'Juntos Por el Cambio' (Together for Change), to urge the current Peronist administration to verify if the wreckage was part of the notorious Pack of wolves convoy of WWII.\n\nArgentine Naval Prefecture investigates the wreck in 2022 – Credit: Prefectura Naval Argentina.\n\nIn a highly confidential Government document obtained exclusively by MercoPress, Members of Argentina’s National Congress have made baffling remarks, shedding light not only on Argentina’s cosy historic relationship with Nazi Germany, but the possible covert smuggling of Nazi’s by the United States Government via Argentina to the United States of America.\n\nIdentifying the vessel has become a top priority, to determine the country of origin, date of sinking and whether there were any important passengers on board who may have disembarked in Argentina before the boat was scuttled.\n\nLikewise, "
