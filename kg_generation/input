The image is a black and white engraving depicting a scene of a religious ceremony taking place in a courtyard. In the center of the courtyard stands a man dressed in regal attire who is likely a bishop. He is surrounded by other figures in various positions of authority and status, including an official holding a scepter, a figure with a miter and crosier, and another figure with a laurel wreath. There are also two figures holding a large key and a book, suggesting a connection to religious or intellectual pursuits. In the background, two buildings are visible, perhaps indicating the location of the cathedral or university. The scene appears to be a formal religious ceremony or investiture, and the figures are arranged in a way that suggests their importance and hierarchical relationship to one another.
