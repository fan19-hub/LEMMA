The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has determined that the original photograph, taken by Raymond R Carr in 2005, featured only one layer of lenticular clouds, whereas the image in question shows multiple layers. This indicates that additional layers of clouds have been added to the original photograph through digital manipulation.\n\nThe external resources provided include a Wikipedia article on lenticular clouds, which explains the scientific basis for their formation, and other articles that describe the phenomenon of lenticular clouds and their occurrence around Mount Fuji. However, the key piece of information comes from the fact-checking sources that specifically address the image in question, confirming that it has been photoshopped.\n\nGiven this information, the image and the accompanying text create a \"False Connection\" between the visual content and the claim of a natural phenomenon. While lenticular clouds do indeed form over mountains and can be scientifically explained, the image has been manipulated to exaggerate the occurrence, thus misleading viewers into believing that such a dramatic and layered cloud formation is a natural event when, in fact, it is not.\n\nThe correct classification for this news, based on the provided definitions, is \"Manipulated Content\".",

According to Snopes, the image is a combination of two separate photographs: one from 1972 featuring Lemmy with an unidentified girlfriend, and another image of David Bowie. This means that the photograph has been manipulated to create the appearance that Bowie and Lemmy were together when, in fact, they were not.\n\nThe definition of \"Manipulated Content\" fits this situation, as the content has been intentionally altered through photo editing to misrepresent the reality. The image has been manually edited to combine two separate images, creating a false impression of a moment that never occurred.
