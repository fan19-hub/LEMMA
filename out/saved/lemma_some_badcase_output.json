These sources confirm Iceland's commitment to becoming plastic-free across its own label products by 2023 and detail the progress of this initiative.\n\nThe image provided shows a person holding what appears to be paper and pulp trays in front of an Iceland store, which visually supports the news statement about Iceland's commitment to replacing plastic with alternative packaging materials.\n\nBased on the information provided and the external references, there is a consistent narrative that Iceland has indeed made a commitment to eliminate plastic packaging from its own brand products by 2023. There is no indication of satire or parody, misleading content, imposter content, false connection, or manipulated content.

It mentions a player averaging a triple-double, the team's best player leaving, no free agents willing to sign, and a prediction of first-round exits in the playoffs for five straight years. This could be interpreted as a commentary on a specific team's situation in the NBA.\n\nThe external resources provided reference historical events in the NBA, such as LeBron James leaving the Miami Heat and Shaquille O'Neal leaving the Orlando Magic. These events were significant in the NBA and had a considerable impact on their respective teams.

The external resources do not provide enough context to verify the specific claims made in the original text, such as the prediction of five straight years of first-round exits.
