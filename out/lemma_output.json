        "explain": "The original text of the news claims that scientists reported rats exposed to the smell of human excrement produce more prolactin, a hormone that rises during fetal development, suggesting that rats and mice can detect when women are pregnant. To assess the accuracy of this claim, we must consider the external knowledge provided.\n\nThe external resources mention the ability of animals, specifically dogs, to detect pregnancy with high accuracy due to hormonal changes that alter a woman's scent. While this supports the idea that some animals can sense pregnancy, none of the provided resources directly confirm the specific claim about rats and their reaction to the smell of human excrement leading to increased prolactin production.\n\nThe resource from Eco Bear discusses a rat's sense of smell in terms of fight or flight response, and the Orkin article confirms that rats have a keen sense of smell that can detect changes in the environment. However, neither source discusses prolactin or the ability to detect pregnancy specifically.\n\nGiven the information provided, the claim in the original text is not directly supported by the external resources. While the resources suggest that animals can sense pregnancy and that rats have a strong sense of smell, there is no specific evidence provided that confirms the claim about prolactin production in rats due to exposure to human excrement.\n\nTherefore, based on the lack of direct evidence supporting the specific claim, the news should be classified as \"Unverified\" because there is insufficient information to conclusively determine the accuracy of the content.\n",

        "direct_explain": "The image provided is a logo of PubMed, which is a free search engine accessing primarily the MEDLINE database of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics. While the logo suggests that the information might be sourced from a scientific publication, the text itself contains inaccuracies and misconceptions. Firstly, prolactin is a hormone associated with milk production, not specifically with 'rising up during fetal development'. Secondly, the claim that rats can detect when women are pregnant due to exposure to the smell of human excrement and a subsequent increase in prolactin is not supported by scientific consensus or evidence. The text seems to confuse the concepts of hormonal changes during pregnancy with the ability of animals to detect pregnancy, which is not solely based on the smell of excrement. Therefore, the text appears to be misinformation as it presents a flawed understanding of biological processes and falsely implies a scientific basis for these claims."
