The external resources confirm that there was indeed a terror attack in Paris, with one person dead and two injured near the Eiffel Tower, and the perpetrator had previously faced terrorism charges. Additionally, there is information about the French military planning to deploy 15,000 soldiers for security, which could be related to the general security measures in Paris, possibly in preparation for events like the upcoming Paris Olympics.\n\nThe information from the external resources aligns with the content of the original tweet, indicating that the French military deployment is related to actual events, including a terror attack and security preparations. There is no indication that the content is satirical, misleading, imposter-generated, falsely connected, or manipulated. The news tweet appears to be reporting on a real situation, and the external resources support the claim of a terror attack and the presence of military personnel in Paris.\n\nTherefore, the news content can be classified as \"True\" since it is accurate in accordance with the facts provided by the external resources.\n\nTrue",
