life feminism ftw scholastic is releasing an empowering book series about historical princesses that blacks out the chapter where they get married at age
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a book with a chapter that has been redacted, which aligns with the claim in the input text that a book series is being released with chapters blacked out. However, without additional context or evidence, it is not possible to verify if this image is from the specific book series mentioned or if Scholastic is indeed releasing such a series. The image alone does not confirm the existence of the entire book series or the intention behind the redaction. Therefore, the claim could be misleading or taken out of context, suggesting the potential for misinformation.
Text: 
government of ontario is planning to flee to toronto after donald trump presidency could mean hike in manitoba hydro losses from bipole iii keeyask are going to happen in canada
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text contains several elements that are disjointed and do not logically connect, which suggests misinformation. The government of Ontario fleeing to Toronto does not make sense as Toronto is within Ontario. The reference to Donald Trump's presidency affecting Manitoba Hydro losses is also illogical, as Trump was the President of the United States, not Canada, and his presidency would not directly dictate the financial outcomes of a Canadian energy project. Additionally, the image provided does not offer any relevant information or evidence that would support the text, as it simply shows a man in a suit with no context that ties him to the claims made in the text.
Text: children suffering from anxiety and depression will be offered counselling at school under government plans to tackle a widely reported crisis in young peoples mental healthattempt to stop any psychological difficulties deepening into lifelong issues
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a child who appears to be in a state of distress, which is consistent with the text discussing children suffering from anxiety and depression. The image complements the text by providing a visual representation of the issue being addressed. The logo "The Observer" suggests that the image is from a news source, which may lend credibility to the report. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
google rewards reputable reporting not leftwing politics our statistical study revealed no evidence of ideological bias in the search engines news tab
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided appears to be a chart that plots various news sources on a spectrum from "left-wing" to "right-wing." The presence of this image alongside the text suggests that the text is making a claim about the lack of ideological bias in Google's news tab. However, the image itself does not provide any evidence regarding the methodology or results of a statistical study on Google's news tab. Instead, it shows a general perception of the ideological leanings of various news outlets, which is not directly related to Google's algorithms or search results. Therefore, the image does not substantiate the claim made in the text, and this discrepancy could indicate the presence of misinformation.

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a person, presumably Governor David Ige, signing a document at a ceremonial event with several onlookers. The setting is consistent with the description of a bill-signing event. The presence of a ceremonial table, a document, and witnesses is typical for such an occasion.

Text:
people are obsessing over this one word in the explosive nyt oped written by an anonymous trump official and they think it might be a clue about who wrote it
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a man who appears to be a politician, possibly giving a speech with the American flag in the background. However, the image alone does not provide any evidence or clues about the identity of the anonymous author of the op-ed mentioned in the input text. The image does not contain any text or explicit clues that would link it to the op-ed or the obsession over a specific word within it. Therefore, the image does not corroborate the text, and the use of this image in the context of the input text could be misleading, suggesting misinformation in the post.
Text:
in a hole in the ground there lived a bear not a nasty dirty wet hole filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell nor yet a dry bare sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat it was a bearhole and that means comfort
Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text describes a bear living in a comfortable hole, which is not a typical natural habitat for bears but rather a whimsical or fictional scenario. The image shows a bear sitting in front of what appears to be a man-made structure resembling a hole with a door, which could be interpreted as a "bearhole" from the text. There is no direct evidence of misinformation as the text seems to be a playful or fictional description, and the image complements this by showing a bear in a setting that could be seen as comfortable for the animal. The text and image are consistent with each other in the context of a fictional or playful narrative.
Text:
beehive fences in africa provide a easy lowcost way for farmers to ward off elephants without harming them as an added benefit the honey the guard bees provide is a valuable and edible resource that can diversify their farm beyond its usual crops
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a series of beehives suspended from posts, which are consistent with the concept of beehive fences described in the input text. These fences are known to be used in Africa to deter elephants from entering farmland, as elephants tend to avoid bees. The hives appear to be actively maintained, suggesting that they could indeed provide honey as a byproduct, which aligns with the claim that the honey can be a valuable resource for farmers. There is no evident inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a shark in the ocean near a device that appears to be a scientific instrument, possibly used for collecting samples of sea water or marine life. This is consistent with the input text, which mentions that DNA filtered from sea water has revealed the presence of rare shark species. The image supports the text by showing a shark in proximity to what could be a device for collecting DNA samples. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The text describes a situation where a Baltimore teenager, who was featured in a Washington Post article about his struggles to graduate from a troubled high school, receives support from nearly strangers. The image shows a young man, presumably the teenager mentioned, in a conversation with an adult in a uniform that could be associated with a school or community event. The setting appears to be a gymnasium with tables in the background that could be part of an event or fair, possibly related to education or community support. There is no clear inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. The image complements the text by showing a scene that could be related to the described circumstances.
Text:

This aligns with the text's narrative about the man experiencing joy in his second go at life, suggesting that he has found happiness again possibly with a new partner and child. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
dying floriculture in spite of goebbelss reassuring speeches confusion in the german army keeps growing all the buds have faded and one has even fallen down goebbels is the flower grower and knows his business but it is not going to save the flower anyway
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text and the image appear to be using metaphorical language and visuals to criticize the state of affairs in Germany during the time of Joseph Goebbels, who was a prominent figure in Nazi Germany. The text metaphorically describes the "dying floriculture" as a symbol of the failing state, despite "Goebbels's reassuring speeches." The image complements this metaphor by depicting a caricature of Goebbels watering dead or wilting flowers, which aligns with the metaphor of dying floriculture. The image seems to be a piece of propaganda, likely from the Soviet Union given the Cyrillic text, aimed at discrediting Goebbels and the German army's efforts during that time.
The term "misinformation" typically refers to false or misleading information presented as fact. In this case, both the text and the image are using symbolism to convey a political message or opinion rather than stating factual information. Therefore, the post does not contain misinformation in the traditional sense, as it is clearly intended as political commentary or satire rather than an attempt to mislead with factual claims. However, since the task is to assess the consistency between the text and the image, and they are consistent with each other in their metaphorical depiction, the post is not presenting misinformation in the context of its metaphorical and satirical content.

unlike more than countries ireland does not allow its citizens who are abroad to vote on elections and referendums after a vote by students unions uk universities are funding irish students to go home and vote on the upcoming referendum because voters should not be denied their right to vote
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided is from "The Irish Times," which is a reputable newspaper in Ireland. However, the image itself does not verify the claim made in the text regarding UK universities funding Irish students to go home and vote. The image shows a person with no context or evidence that relates to the claim about student unions or universities funding travel for voting purposes. Without additional verification, the claim remains unsubstantiated and could potentially be misinformation. It is important to cross-reference such claims with official statements or reports from the entities involved.

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a snail on the glass of an aquarium, which is consistent with the input text's description of a watersnail eating algae off the aquarium glass. The pink circular part that could be interpreted as the snail's mouth is visible, and it appears to be in contact with the glass, which aligns with the text's description of the snail's mouth opening and closing as it eats. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a young child who appears to be in a park, which is consistent with the text's narrative about a girl's health situation. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text, and the image of a child could be used to evoke empathy and support the story of a child needing heart surgery. Without additional context or evidence to suggest otherwise, there is no clear indication of misinformation based solely on the image and the text provided.

There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the claim of the text about collecting posters from different countries. Without further evidence to suggest that the poster is not original or not from the country implied by its style, there is no clear indication of misinformation based on the image and text provided.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided does not support the text. The image appears to be a generic graphic related to news media, with no specific connection to the story of a police constable named Ayaz Mian from Swat returning a bag of money. There is no visual evidence of the event, the person in question, the bag of money, or any related activity that would corroborate the story in the text. Therefore, based on the inconsistency between the text and the image, it is likely that this post contains misinformation.
Text:

Prediction: The image shows a device attached to a bicycle that appears to be collecting water into a bottle. This is consistent with the text, which describes a "bike bottle" that makes water from the air as you cycle. There is no immediate evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image. However, without additional context or verification, it is not possible to fully assess the functionality or effectiveness of the device.

news pr nightmare makeawish accidentally sent a costumed hero named terminally ill spiderman to a healthy kids house and asked the child to comfort him in his final hours
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a person in a Spider-Man costume lying on the floor, seemingly unwell, with an IV stand next to them, while a child in bed appears to be talking to them. The scenario described in the text is highly unusual and improbable, as it suggests a charity organization like Make-A-Wish would send a "terminally ill Spider-Man" to a healthy child's house, which contradicts the organization's mission and common sense. The image seems to be staged or taken from a fictional context, as it is not typical for a costumed character to be connected to an IV stand in a real-life situation. Therefore, the text likely contains misinformation.
Text:
miss world has axed the famed bikinis from this years pageant in indonesia replacing the skimpy swimsuits with conservative beach sarongs amid mounting protests from hardline muslim groups
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a woman wearing a crown and sash indicating that she is "Miss World," which is consistent with the context of the Miss World pageant mentioned in the input text. However, the image does not provide any specific information about the attire worn during the pageant or any changes to it. Therefore, there is no direct evidence in the image to confirm or refute the claim made in the text about the replacement of bikinis with sarongs. Without contradictory evidence, we cannot conclude that there is misinformation based solely on the image provided.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that there is a vote on the potential banning of alcohol in Sweden on the 27th, and it suggests that crayfish require certain beverages, implying that if you don't vote against the ban, you will have to abstain from crayfish. The image shows a poster with a strong message urging people to vote "NEJ!" (No in Swedish) on the 27th of August, with a picture of crayfish and beverages, which supports the idea that the vote is related to alcohol consumption and crayfish tradition. However, the text's claim that crayfish requires these beverages and that one must abstain from crayfish if they don't vote no is misleading and plays on the cultural significance of crayfish parties in Sweden, which traditionally include the consumption of alcoholic beverages. The text seems to be using a scare tactic to influence the vote, which can be considered misinformation as it presents a false consequence.

Label: 0
Prediction: The image provided is of low quality and does not clearly show a scene from Disney World's Hollywood Studios' Fantasmic firework finale. It is not possible to confirm the presence of characters, a boat, or a fireproof tarp being thrown over Ariel. Due to the lack of visual evidence supporting the claim made in the text, the post may contain misinformation.
Text:
life bad news music lovers yoyo ma has fallen in love and broken the agreement he made with a mystic who gave him his musical gift in exchange for a lifetime of solitude
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that the musician Yo-Yo Ma has broken an agreement with a mystic who gave him his musical talent in exchange for a lifetime of solitude. This narrative is highly implausible as it suggests a supernatural element to his musical abilities, which is not grounded in reality. The image shows Yo-Yo Ma playing the cello with a green, mystical-looking visual effect around him, which appears to be digitally altered or artistically rendered to give a supernatural impression. The image does not provide credible evidence for the claim in the text; instead, it seems to be an artistic or humorous depiction rather than a factual representation. Therefore, the post contains misinformation.
Text:

Prediction: The image shows a room that appears to be abandoned or in disrepair, with a message written on the wall that reads "VOCÊ ESTÁ MORTO," which translates to "YOU ARE DEAD" in Portuguese. This is consistent with the input text, which describes a scenario where someone finds a message written on the wall in a dark room in Brazil. The text and the image are consistent with each other, and there is no evidence within the provided content to suggest misinformation.
Text:
pakistan releases scores of indian fishermen at least fishermen set free as goodwill gesture ahead of swearingin ceremony of narendra modi as prime minister
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows individuals behind bars, which could imply that they are imprisoned or detained. However, the image alone does not provide enough context to confirm the release of Indian fishermen by Pakistan as a goodwill gesture, nor does it confirm the timing in relation to the swearing-in ceremony of Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. Without additional context or evidence to support the claim made in the text, we cannot verify the accuracy of the information, and thus it could potentially be misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a person who appears to be Michael Flynn speaking in front of a classroom with a whiteboard that reads "BEING A FOREIGN AGENT IS NOT THE ANSWER!" This message is consistent with the idea of discouraging illegal activities such as lying to the FBI about contacts with foreign diplomats. However, without additional context or verification, it is not possible to confirm whether Michael Flynn is actually visiting high schools as part of a plea bargain to speak about the consequences of lying to the FBI. The claim is specific and would require verification from credible sources to confirm its accuracy. Therefore, based on the information provided and the potential for the text to be unverified or misleading, it is assessed as misinformation.

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that scientists reported rats exposed to the smell of human excrement produce more prolactin, a hormone that rises during fetal development, and suggests this is why rats can detect when women are pregnant. However, the image provided is simply the logo of PubMed, a reputable database for scientific literature. The image does not confirm or provide evidence for the specific claim made in the text. Without a specific study or source to back up the claim, the information provided in the text cannot be verified against the image. Therefore, the post may contain misinformation due to the lack of supporting evidence from the image.

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text and image claim that a "newly discovered conservative book of the Bible reveals Christ was a self-made millionaire who sold mousetraps." This statement is inconsistent with widely accepted historical and religious accounts of the life of Jesus Christ. There is no scholarly evidence or religious doctrine to support the claim that Jesus Christ was a self-made millionaire or that he engaged in the selling of mousetraps. The image appears to be satirical in nature, and the source, "PatriotHole," is known for producing satirical content. Therefore, the post contains misinformation.
Text:
disgraceful photo of recreational hunter happily posing next to a triceratops he just slaughtered please share so the world can name and shame this despicable dog
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a dog wearing a dinosaur headpiece, sitting next to a model or a representation of a triceratops. Triceratops are extinct and have been for millions of years, making it impossible for a recreational hunter to pose with a real one. The text is clearly intended to be satirical or a joke, as it is not possible to hunt extinct animals. The image and text together are meant to be humorous and not a genuine claim of hunting activity. However, the text is presented as if it were a serious accusation, which could mislead someone not familiar with the context or the nature of the extinct triceratops. Therefore, the post contains misinformation due to the false premise that a triceratops could be hunted in the modern era.

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a chaplain, identifiable by his attire and the presence of a cross on his helmet, administering last rites to a fallen individual, consistent with the description in the input text. The soldiers in the background with their weapons at the ready suggest a warzone environment, which aligns with the mention of Vietnam. The scene depicted in the image corresponds with historical accounts of Dickey Chapelle, who was indeed a female war correspondent killed in Vietnam. The photographer Henri Huet is known for his work during the Vietnam War, adding credibility to the claim that he captured this moment. Therefore, there is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The text claims that the image of an old chip can will explain how chips were protected by being packed full, implying that the method of packing chips has changed from being full to now being packed with nitrogen. However, the image shows an old chip can with a text that talks about the chips being delivered in specially constructed spring cushioned trucks and does not mention anything about the chips being packed full as a method of protection. The image does not support the claim made in the input text, suggesting that there is misinformation in the post.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction: The text and the image appear to be consistent with each other. The image is a propaganda poster that matches the message in the input text, claiming that a significant amount of coal has been provided for winter relief, which is attributed to the accomplishments of the leader referred to as "the Führer." The poster is designed to encourage people to vote for him. There is no direct evidence of misinformation based solely on the consistency between the text and the image. However, without historical context or additional information, it's not possible to verify the factual accuracy of the claim about the coal provision.
Text:
map showing nazi german plans given to sudeten germans during the sudeten crisis as part of an intimidation process republished in the british newspaper daily worker
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided appears to be a propaganda piece, likely from the World War II era, showing the expansion of Nazi Germany from 1938 to 1943. The text at the top translates to "One people, one empire, one leader!" which was a common Nazi slogan. The bottom part of the image includes the phrase "Deutschland, Deutschland über alles," which is a line from the German national anthem that was used during the Nazi era to promote nationalist sentiment. The map sequence shows the territorial expansion of Nazi Germany, which is consistent with historical events.
However, the claim that this map was given to Sudeten Germans during the Sudeten Crisis as part of an intimidation process and republished in the British newspaper Daily Worker cannot be verified based on the image alone. The Daily Worker was a British communist newspaper, and it is plausible that they could have republished such a map as part of their reporting or to criticize Nazi expansionism. However, without additional context or evidence, it is not possible to confirm the specific use of this map as described in the input text. Therefore, the prediction of misinformation is due to the lack of verifiable context and evidence connecting the image to the specific claim made in the input text.
Text:

The image provided does not show President Jimmy Carter or General Olusegun Obasanjo. Instead, it shows a person posing with a character that appears to be an anthropomorphic M&M candy. This image does not support the text, which discusses a historical event involving two political figures. Therefore, the post contains misinformation as there is a clear inconsistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Prediction:
The text talks about a world piano competition and a band in Georgia with a sign reminding about the Steam Summer Sale, which is a digital storefront for video games. The image, however, shows a person in a car seemingly struggling with a seat belt. There is no visible connection between the text and the image; the image neither complements the text nor provides evidence for any piano competition or a sign about the Steam Summer Sale. Therefore, the post contains misinformation due to the inconsistency between the text and the image.
Text:
billy joe targaryen first and last of his name and his dragon frenulum the limp were largely omitted from the great histories of westeros chroniclers of land agree that this was likely for the best
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text and the image appear to be a work of fiction or satire. The name "Billy Joe Targaryen" and the dragon "Frenulum the Limp" are not part of the known histories of Westeros from the "A Song of Ice and Fire" series by George R.R. Martin or the "Game of Thrones" television adaptation. The image shows a person riding a dragon with a whimsical appearance, which does not match the aesthetic of the dragons from the series and seems to be digitally altered or created for humorous or artistic purposes. Therefore, the post is likely to contain misinformation if it is presented as a factual account.
Text:

The text mentions an individual trying to solve a problem on a United Airlines flight and references playing a game of Garry's Mod prop hunt while disguised as a goblin for Halloween. However, the image shows a person in a superhero costume, possibly at a car dealership or similar setting, with no indication of an airline environment, Halloween, or the video game Garry's Mod. The inconsistency between the text and the image suggests that the post may contain misinformation.

The image provided is a historical illustration that seems to depict Asian laborers, possibly Chinese immigrants, working in what could be the 19th-century United States, likely during the time of the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad or other similar labor-intensive projects involving Asian immigrants. The text and the image are consistent with each other in that they both relate to Asian American history. There is no clear indication of misinformation based on the provided text and image.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows two men who appear to be playfully embracing in shallow water, with no immediate signs of distress or danger from the wave behind them. The wave itself does not appear to be of a size or force that would be associated with a tsunami. The text claims that these individuals were swept away by a wave and never seen again due to the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, but the image does not support this claim. The Tohoku earthquake and tsunami were catastrophic events, and any images associated with it would likely show much more severe and obvious destruction or distress. Therefore, the text and the image are inconsistent, suggesting that the post contains misinformation.

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image appears to be consistent with the description provided in the input text. It shows a poster by Italian artist Gino Boccasile that depicts American soldiers as gangsters during WWII. The text in the image, in Italian, translates to "The inhuman crimes of the 'gangster pilots' always disgrace the United States from the civil consortium," which aligns with the description of the text in the input. The image and the text both suggest that the poster was created to portray American soldiers negatively, which was a form of propaganda used during the war. There is no immediate evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.

The image provided does not offer any relevant information that would confirm or refute the claims made in the input text. The image simply shows a logo with the letters "MP" on a blue background, which does not correlate with the content of the text regarding marijuana legalization and its effects on pets. Therefore, the image does not complement or provide evidence for the text, and the post could potentially contain misinformation due to the lack of supporting visual evidence.

Prediction: The image provided is an animated character and does not depict Childish Gambino or any scene related to the music video for "This Is America." The text discusses the release of the song "This Is America" by Childish Gambino, which is a live-action music video. The inconsistency between the text and the image suggests that there is misinformation present in the post.
Text:
life this ones on her this woman gave more than to an online dating scammer even though the guy had only texted her hello and never asked her for money
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that a woman gave a large sum of money to an online dating scammer after receiving only a message saying "hello" and without the scammer asking for money. The image shows a woman who appears to be upset or concerned, which could be consistent with someone who has experienced a negative event. However, there is no evidence in the image that confirms the specific situation described in the text, such as screenshots of the conversation, proof of the transaction, or other details that would support the claim. The scenario described in the text seems implausible, as it is unlikely that someone would give away money without any interaction or request. Therefore, the post may contain misinformation due to the lack of verifiable evidence and the unlikely nature of the claim.

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a group of students seated in individual car simulators, which aligns with the input text stating that students at Brooklyn High School are learning to handle the controls of a car and experience simulated traffic conditions. The setup appears to be an old-fashioned driving simulator system, likely the Aetna Drivo mentioned in the text, which was a driver's education tool used in the past. The image and the text are consistent with each other, and there is no evidence of misinformation based on the information provided.

recently declassified video of robert oppenheimer seen in white tshirt launching a prototype of fat man the bomb dropped over nagasaki japan c
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that the image is a recently declassified video of Robert Oppenheimer in a white t-shirt launching a prototype of the Fat Man bomb dropped over Nagasaki, Japan. However, the image provided shows what appears to be a still from a casual video featuring modern-day people in a non-military setting, likely at a pool or water park. This setting is inconsistent with the historical context of the Manhattan Project and the development of the Fat Man bomb during World War II. Additionally, Robert Oppenheimer, the scientific director of the Manhattan Project, would not have been involved in a public demonstration of a bomb prototype, especially not in such an informal setting. Therefore, the text contains misinformation as it inaccurately describes the content of the image.
Text:
waianae woman receives medal for her grandfather it was only in the past few months that tanya mariano kearns of waianae discovered her grandfather was a filipino world war ii veteran
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a woman holding a framed photograph of a man in military uniform, which is consistent with the text stating that Tanya Mariano Kearns of Waianae discovered her grandfather was a Filipino World War II veteran. The setting appears to be a personal space, possibly her home, given the Christmas tree in the background, which suggests a familial connection. There is no evident inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation.
Text:
elephant gets tusksaving surgery the zoo in the colombian city of barranquilla successfully performed surgery on a fivetonne african elephant found on a ranch owned by drug traffickers
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a group of people attending to a large elephant lying on the ground, which is consistent with the input text's description of an elephant receiving surgery. The presence of medical equipment and personnel in the image supports the text's claim. Additionally, the watermark of "BBC NEWS" suggests that the image comes from a reputable news source, which lends credibility to the scenario being genuine. Therefore, there is no indication of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
west virginia the opioid epidemic is costing boone countys economy an estimated million a year the highest percapita burden of any county in america according to a new report by the american enterprise institute
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows prescription bottles, a syringe, a spoon, and multiple pills, which are commonly associated with opioid use and abuse. This visual is consistent with the Input Text discussing the opioid epidemic's economic impact on Boone County, West Virginia. There is no direct contradiction between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. However, without access to the report by the American Enterprise Institute, I cannot verify the accuracy of the specific claim regarding the economic burden. The image alone does not provide evidence to confirm or refute the exact figures mentioned in the text.
Text:
a young italian woman attempts to terminate her pregnancy before the referendum of these backalley abortions were commonplace and often resulted in the death of the mother
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not seem to correlate with the serious and sensitive nature of the input text. The text discusses a young Italian woman attempting to terminate her pregnancy before a referendum, with a mention of the dangers of backalley abortions. However, the image shows a woman in a domestic setting, seemingly rolling out dough and smiling at the camera, which does not support the text's claim or context. There is no indication in the image of anything related to the topic of abortion or the historical context of a referendum. Therefore, the inconsistency between the text and the image suggests that this post may contain misinformation.
Text:
video get enraged patriots the deep state has been sending me fresh seasonal ingredients and easytofollow recipes to turn my dinners into gourmet meals
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image and the text together appear to be satirical or a parody, as indicated by the logo "PATRIOTHOLE" which resembles that of a satirical news site. The concept of the "deep state" sending someone meal kits is an absurd notion and plays on the conspiracy theory trope for comedic effect. Therefore, the post is likely intended as humor rather than genuine information, but it contains misinformation because the claim about the deep state is not based on fact.
Text:
the racist dog policemen must withdraw immediately from our communities iconic poster poster made by the black panther party with huey p newton x
Label: 1
Prediction: The image is consistent with the text. It shows a well-known photograph of Huey P. Newton, co-founder of the Black Panther Party, seated in a wicker chair holding a spear and a rifle. This image is indeed an iconic poster associated with the Black Panther Party, which aligns with the text's description. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
bolshevism without a mask large antibolshevik exhibition of the nsdap gauleitung berlin from to in the reichstag building herbert agricola munich print hheenemann kg berlinwilmersdorf
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text describes an anti-Bolshevik exhibition by the NSDAP (Nazi Party) that took place in the Reichstag building, and the image is a poster advertising that exhibition. The text on the poster matches the description given in the input text, indicating that the image is consistent with the text. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image. However, it is important to note that the content itself, given its historical context, is propaganda material from the Nazi era and thus inherently contains biased and politically motivated messaging.
Text:
poster for the cairo declaration an upcoming chinese film about the cairo conference the poster features mao zedong who was not actually present at the event
Label: 1
Prediction: The poster for the film "The Cairo Declaration" indeed features an image of Mao Zedong among other historical figures. However, Mao Zedong was not actually present at the Cairo Conference, which makes the poster historically inaccurate and thus contains misinformation in the context of the historical event it is depicting.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a collection of items that include paper currency, coins, and what appears to be a piece of paper or fabric with a pattern on it, all spread out on a table. This is consistent with the input text, which mentions a "small beginner collection" of "mildly interesting finds." There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text, and the items displayed could reasonably be considered collectible or interesting to someone who has started collecting recently. Therefore, there is no evidence of misinformation based on the provided text and image.
Text:
aid workers carefully distribute food water and blankets to refugees fleeing conflict and persecution in darfur under the cover of darkness late
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a person offering a piece of food to a raccoon at night, which does not correlate with the text describing aid workers distributing food, water, and blankets to refugees. The content of the image does not support the text, as it does not depict aid workers, refugees, or the distribution of humanitarian aid. Therefore, the post contains misinformation due to the inconsistency between the text and the image.
Text:
a roman temple has been restored to its original site seven metres below the city of london using sound lights and misty haze to bring the ruin back to life built in the third century the london mithraeum was discovered by chance in on a world war ii bomb site
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows an underground space with ruins that appear to be of ancient origin, illuminated by lights and a person observing them. This is consistent with the description in the input text, which talks about a Roman temple (the London Mithraeum) that has been restored and displayed below the city of London with the use of sound, lights, and mist to recreate the atmosphere of the past. The ruins in the image seem to match the description of the temple being brought back to life for visitors to experience. Therefore, there is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
life stay calm things that could explain why your landlord is still asking you for rent after you painted a portrait of him and left it on his porch
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text suggests that painting a portrait of a landlord could be a reason for the landlord not to ask for rent, which is misleading and not based on any standard rental agreement or legal practice. The image shows two individuals, possibly a tenant and a landlord, in a discussion, which does not provide any evidence that painting a portrait would be an acceptable form of rent payment. Therefore, the post contains misinformation as it implies an unconventional and incorrect method of paying rent.
Text:
bo toi phia truoc o viet nam nam khong biet buc anh nay ton tai cho den khi toi di qua no ngau nhien tren internet anh ay da khoc khi anh ay nhin thay no hy vong day la noi thich hop de dang no
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text and the image do not seem to be consistent with each other. The text in Vietnamese roughly translates to "My father in front in Vietnam did not know this picture existed until I randomly came across it on the internet. He cried when he saw it, hoping this is the right place to post it." The image, however, shows a person pretending to kayak in a very shallow puddle of water, which is likely meant to be humorous. There is no clear connection between the emotional response described in the text and the humorous content of the image. This inconsistency suggests that the post may contain misinformation, as the text does not accurately describe the context or content of the image.
Text:
howdy neighbor a magazine shows russian dictator joseph stalin waving at alaska just across the bering sea during the rumors of communist and fascist activity within the incorporated us territory
Label: 1
Prediction: The image shows a magazine page with a cartoon depicting a figure labeled "RUSSIA" waving at a figure labeled "ALASKA" across the Bering Strait, with the caption "HOWDY, NEIGHBOR". The text refers to Joseph Stalin as a Russian dictator and implies that the image is a depiction of him waving at Alaska during a time of rumored communist and fascist activity in the US territory. However, the cartoon is a stylized representation and does not specifically depict Joseph Stalin, nor does it provide evidence of actual rumors or activities. The use of the term "dictator" is also historically inaccurate as Joseph Stalin was the leader of the Soviet Union, not Russia, and the Soviet Union encompassed much more than modern-day Russia. The image appears to be more of a satirical or symbolic representation rather than a factual report, which could lead to misinformation if taken at face value without proper context.
Text:
years after firefight vietnam vet gets his buddy a purple heart this is simply a story of two best friends forged in war and separated by tragedy both men lived years with their own demons from the vietnam war both believing that the other was dead
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided is a logo, which does not correlate with the story described in the input text. The text talks about a Vietnam veteran receiving a Purple Heart and a story of friendship and war, while the image is simply a logo that appears to be unrelated to the narrative. There is no visual evidence to support the story, and the logo does not provide any context or verification for the claims made in the text. Therefore, the post may contain misinformation due to the inconsistency between the text and the image.
Text:
new york best buy employees chip in to buy a kid a wii u as an early christmas present the boy had been walking in several times a week for several months just to play the one on display
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows the logo of CBS-47 and FOX-30 Action News JAX, which are television stations that could report on such human interest stories. The text describes a feel-good story that is plausible and could have been covered by local news. There is no direct inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. However, without additional context or the ability to verify the story independently, I cannot definitively confirm the accuracy of the text. The assessment is based solely on the consistency between the text and the image provided.
Text:
entering a new market listerine has asked anyone who is planning to clean the viscera off a newborn baby in a bucket of mouthwash to choose listerine
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text and image suggest that Listerine is promoting the use of their mouthwash product for cleaning a newborn baby, which is a highly inappropriate and dangerous practice. This is not a recommended use for mouthwash, and such a claim is likely to be misinformation as it goes against medical advice and common safety practices for infant care.
Text:
this toy turtle from when i was a kid had been sunbaking in my grandmas car for the past years bottom left shows it normal bottom right shows it now
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a toy turtle with discoloration and deformation, which is consistent with the input text's description of a toy that has been exposed to the sun for a long period. The bottom left part of the turtle appears to be less affected, which could be interpreted as the "normal" state mentioned in the text, while the bottom right shows more evident sun damage, aligning with the "now" state. There is no clear indication of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
public interrogation every senator is angrily grilling mark zuckerberg on why clickholes articles arent getting shared as widely on facebook after it changed its algorithms
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that every senator is angrily grilling Mark Zuckerberg about the sharing frequency of ClickHole articles on Facebook due to algorithm changes. However, the image provided shows a single individual, who appears to be a senator or a person of authority, without any visible signs of anger or the act of grilling someone. Additionally, Mark Zuckerberg is not present in the image, and there is no context to suggest that the discussion is about ClickHole's articles or Facebook's algorithms. The image does not support the claim made in the text, which suggests that the post may contain misinformation.
Text:
christopher steele the former british spy who compiled the trump dossier on behalf of the clinton campaign kept supplying allegations to the fbi after the election and even after he was terminated as a source by the bureau for giving confidential information to the media
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a man, presumably Christopher Steele, superimposed on a background with the FBI logo. However, without additional context or verification of the claims made in the text, the image itself does not provide evidence that supports or refutes the text's claims about Steele's actions regarding the dossier or his interactions with the FBI. The image alone cannot serve as proof of the text's accuracy. Therefore, based on the image alone, we cannot determine the truthfulness of the text, and the potential for misinformation exists.
Text:
rare picture one of the victims of project mkultra an immoral mind control program done by the cia during the cold war unknown date sometime between and
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided appears to be a screenshot from a video game or an animated scene, not a photograph of a real person. The character depicted has exaggerated features and a stylized appearance that is not consistent with real-life photography. This discrepancy suggests that the image does not support the claim of being a "rare picture one of the victims of Project MKUltra," which was a real series of experiments conducted by the CIA. Therefore, the post is likely to contain misinformation as the image does not corroborate the text's claim.
Text:
george rr martin only came to set when we were filming scenes with nudity in them didnt talk to anyone then immediately left after they were over
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided is of George R.R. Martin, but it does not offer any evidence regarding his behavior on set or his presence during specific types of scenes. The claim made in the text is specific and would require corroborative evidence to verify its accuracy. Without additional context or proof, the image does not support the claim, and thus the post could potentially contain misinformation.
Text:
years of my mother smoking beside this blind thats always pulled down a certain length have caused it to look like it has a intentional colour fade
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a blind with a gradient color change that could be consistent with the description provided in the text. The bottom part of the blind is darker, which could be attributed to the accumulation of smoke from cigarettes over time, while the top part is lighter, which could be due to less exposure to smoke. This visual evidence does not contradict the claim made in the text, and therefore, there is no indication of misinformation based on the image and text provided.
Text:
after a week of speedrunning the annual summer games done quick videogame charity marathon ended yesterday having raised usd for doctors without borders medecins sans frontieres
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a group of individuals engaged in what appears to be a gaming activity, which is consistent with the context of a videogame charity marathon mentioned in the input text. The setting suggests an event where games are played, likely in a public or communal space, which aligns with the typical environment for a gaming marathon event. However, the input text lacks a specific amount of money raised, which is a critical piece of information for verifying the claim. Without the actual amount, we cannot determine the accuracy of the fundraising claim. Therefore, based solely on the consistency between the text and the image, there is no clear evidence of misinformation, but the text's omission of the fundraising amount prevents full verification.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a rock and a chicken egg side by side, which is consistent with the input text. The rock appears to be an oval shape and has a rough texture, which aligns with the description given in the text. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
left actual french for ground forces shown in street and subway when was the last time you havent overcome yourself becomeyourselfcom right advert answer from ea becomemorethanyourselfcom
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text seems to be a jumbled mix of words that could be interpreted as a commentary on advertising for video games, possibly suggesting that the images show French ground forces in action. However, the image shows two different advertisements: one for a self-improvement website (left) and one for the video game "Battlefield: Bad Company" (right). The text incorrectly associates the advertisement for the video game with actual French ground forces, which is misleading. The website addresses in the text also appear to be altered or incorrect, adding to the misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not depict commercial airliners or an airport environment that would be consistent with the Tenerife disaster involving a KLM flight and a Pan Am flight. Instead, the image shows what appears to be a small, single-engine propeller aircraft and a vehicle on a barren landscape, which does not correlate with the text describing the worst aviation accident in history. The inconsistency between the text and the image suggests that this post contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows two individuals who appear to be a young man and a young woman, which is consistent with the story of a "lovestruck Michigan teen" and his "Newfoundland girlfriend." There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text provided. Without additional context or evidence to suggest otherwise, there is no clear indication of misinformation based on the image and text alone.
Text:
north korean leaflet in spanish targeting puerto rican soldiers telling them that the korean war was not their war and that surrendering would be the best move
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a leaflet written in Spanish, which is consistent with the input text's claim that it is a North Korean leaflet targeting Puerto Rican soldiers. The text on the leaflet appears to be addressing the soldiers, suggesting that the Korean War is not their war and implying that surrendering would be a better option. The presence of Spanish text and the message align with the historical context where North Korea might have tried to demoralize soldiers from countries allied with the United States during the Korean War. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based solely on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
elephant attacks a farmer but is saved by his dog the dog protected its owner despite sustaining an injury below its eye until the elephant backed off
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows an elephant standing alone in what appears to be a natural setting. There is no evidence of an attack, a farmer, a dog, or any injury in the image. However, the absence of these elements in the image does not necessarily indicate misinformation, as the image could simply be a general representation of an elephant. The text describes a specific event that is not depicted in the image, but the image does not contradict the text either. Therefore, based on the image alone, we cannot conclude that the text contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction: The image provided does not show any individuals or a scene that can be clearly identified as a freak accident involving a person and a flamethrower. It is a generic image of flames, which could be from any fire and does not provide evidence to support the claim made in the text. Without any identifiable features or context that link the image to the specific incident described, the image does not corroborate the text, suggesting the possibility of misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The text claims that Brazil has adopted a pattern of European-inspired outlets which is not compatible with the European or Swiss plugs and that a significant portion of the population hates it. However, the image shows a type of power outlet that is indeed used in Brazil, known as the "Type N" electrical outlet, which is designed to be compatible with both Brazilian and Europlug (Type C) devices. The claim that it is not compatible with European plugs is misinformation, as the Type N outlet was specifically designed to accommodate both Brazilian and Europlug standards. The statement about the population's opinion cannot be verified through the image.
Text:

The image shows a Humboldt penguin with an egg, which is consistent with the input text stating that a Humboldt penguin named Andi at St. Andrews Aquarium has laid her first eggs. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
emile zola publishing the famous newspaper article jaccuse accusing the french legal system of injustice and antisemitism against alfred dreyfus
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not appear to be consistent with the historical context of Emile Zola and the "J'accuse...!" article related to the Dreyfus Affair. The person in the image seems to be from a modern courtroom setting, possibly from a film or television show, rather than a depiction of Emile Zola or the late 19th-century period in which the Dreyfus Affair took place. Therefore, the image does not support the text, suggesting that there may be misinformation present in the post.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a person typing on a computer keyboard, which is a generic representation that could be associated with the activities of NSA staffers or tech industry employees. There is no direct contradiction between the image and the input text. The text claims that former NSA employees are sought after in Silicon Valley, which is plausible given the tech industry's need for cybersecurity expertise and the ongoing concerns about government surveillance. The image does not provide any specific evidence to support or refute the text, but it also does not contain any elements that would suggest misinformation. Therefore, based solely on the consistency between the text and the image, there is no clear indication of misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a bright orange-red light pattern on a wall, which is consistent with the description in the input text of a sunrise causing a refraction that appears bright orange-red. The text claims that the refraction is shining into a window and the image supports this claim, showing a light pattern that could reasonably be caused by sunlight passing through a window. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Text:

Label: 1
Prediction: The image appears to be a historical postcard that visually represents the input text's description. It shows figures representing Italian-speaking regions (likely Trentino and Trieste, as indicated by their attire and the Italian flag) being held back by figures representing Austria, which aligns with the historical context of these regions' aspirations to join Italy. The text on the postcard, "Giuste Aspirazioni," translates to "True Aspirations," which is consistent with the input text's message. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a ceremony where a man is being honored, as indicated by someone placing a medal around his neck. There are uniformed officers and what appears to be an audience capturing the moment on their cameras. This visual evidence is consistent with the text, which mentions a man being honored for saving a newborn's life. There is no apparent inconsistency or misinformation based on the information provided.
Text:
new panty pillowcases allow users to simulate the experience of lying on a womans crotch soaking up the sleepers oils to create a distinct scent
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a pillow with what appears to be a pair of women's underwear stretched over it. However, there is no evidence in the image that supports the claim that these pillowcases are designed to "simulate the experience of lying on a woman's crotch" or that they are capable of "soaking up the sleeper's oils to create a distinct scent." The image simply shows a pillow with underwear on it, without any additional context or proof that the product performs as described. The claim in the text seems to be sensational and without substantiation, which suggests that it could be misinformation.
Text:
the coop is to end lastminute sales of fresh produce to reduce the volume of edible food going to waste in its stores every day retailer will give fresh produce to community groups two hours before stores close
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a promotional sign for "HALF PRICE" bananas at a Co-op store, with a date from 2018, which does not provide evidence for or against the claim made in the input text about the Co-op ending last-minute sales of fresh produce to reduce waste. The image is not directly related to the claim about the new policy on food waste, and the presence of a date from 2018 suggests that the image is not current. Therefore, the image does not support the text, and it is possible that misinformation exists due to the inconsistency between the text and the image.
Text:
s china industry learns from daqing agriculture from dazhai and the whole country learns from the army daqing was a famous oil field and dazhai was a model farming village
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text describes a slogan from a period in Chinese history that encouraged learning from the industrial success of Daqing, the agricultural model of Dazhai, and the discipline of the People's Liberation Army. The image provided is a propaganda poster that visually aligns with the historical context of the text. It shows three individuals, each representing industry (with an oil worker), agriculture (with a farmer), and the military (with a soldier), all holding what appears to be the "Little Red Book" which contains quotations from Chairman Mao. The imagery and text are consistent with each other and reflect the propaganda and political campaigns of the time in China. There is no direct evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows three women in a courtroom setting, which is consistent with the context of a sentencing retrial mentioned in the input text. The woman in the middle appears to be a defendant in a trial, which aligns with the reference to Jodi Arias, who was indeed a defendant in a high-profile murder case. The expressions on the faces of the individuals could be interpreted as serious or concerned, which would be appropriate for the context of a sentencing retrial. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided.
Text:

Prediction:
The image provided is a still from an animated show or movie, which is inconsistent with the claim in the input text that it is a photo of someone's father in Vietnam. The characters in the image are clearly animated and not real people, which indicates that the text is not accurately describing the image. Therefore, this post contains misinformation.

Prediction:
The image provided does not correlate with the input text. The image appears to be of comic book panels, possibly depicting a character similar to Thanos from the Marvel Universe, which has no relation to Nintendo, Shuntaro Furukawa, or the Nintendo Switch Online service. Therefore, the image does not complement or provide evidence for the text, suggesting that the post may contain misinformation.

The image shows a person wearing a baseball uniform with the name "Bracamonte" and the number 85 on the back, which corresponds with the name mentioned in the text, Javier Bracamonte. The person appears to be in a stadium and is looking towards the stands, which is consistent with the description of a bullpen catcher throwing equipment to kids after a game. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.

Prediction:
The text describes the Behistun Inscription, which is indeed an ancient inscription created by Darius the Great, the king of Persia, around 500 BC. The image shows a bas-relief that is part of the Behistun Inscription located in Iran. The content of the text is consistent with the image, as the image appears to be of an ancient relief that could plausibly be the Behistun Inscription. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.

Prediction:
The image does not depict a historical scene from the Battle of the Milvian Bridge or a vision sent from the heavens as described in the text. Instead, it shows a modern-day setting with a person sitting on a bench and a cartoonish figure, which appears to be a mascot or a statue, not a divine vision. The content of the image is inconsistent with the historical event mentioned in the text, indicating that this post contains misinformation.

The image shows two individuals in the cockpit of an aircraft, wearing headsets, which is consistent with the text describing someone flying as a licensed pilot. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the claim made in the text. The individual on the right appears to be an older person, which could align with the mention of "less than a month after his th birthday," suggesting a significant birthday milestone. Without additional context or evidence to the contrary, there is no clear indication of misinformation based on the image and text provided.

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows two screenshots from what appears to be a social media platform, with both featuring the same gif of a woman running. The top screenshot is labeled "1st place!" and has more upvotes compared to the bottom one, which is titled "Maybe Maybe Maybe". This visual evidence is consistent with the input text, which describes a scenario where the same gif was posted on different subreddits, with one getting more attention and upvotes than the other. There is no indication of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.

it isnt wise to stand against me leonidas imagine what horrible fate awaits my enemies when i would gladly kill any of my own men for victory
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not seem to correlate with the text. The text appears to be a quote that could be attributed to a historical or fictional military leader, suggesting a ruthless attitude towards victory. However, the image shows a child sitting in a throne-like chair with decorative elements that do not match the serious and grim tone of the text. The juxtaposition of a child in a relaxed pose with the aggressive content of the text suggests a lack of consistency, which could indicate that the post containing both the text and the image may contain misinformation or be a satirical or fictional creation rather than a factual report.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text is incoherent and does not form a logical sentence. It mentions New Zealand's national basketball team in conjunction with an unrelated statement about factory floors and self-injurious or aggressive behavior, which does not make sense together. The image shows an advertisement for a food collection event for Philabundance organized by Preston & Steve from 93.3 WMMR, which has no relation to the text provided. The inconsistency between the text and the image indicates misinformation.
Text:
ill eliminate carbon tax andrew scheers secret meeting with oil executives map out strategy for tackling terrorism organized crime deputy admits no clear answer to questions
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text and the image provided do not seem to be consistent with each other. The text talks about Andrew Scheer's secret meeting with oil executives, a strategy for tackling terrorism and organized crime, and a deputy admitting to having no clear answers to questions. However, the image shows a crowd of people at what appears to be a protest or public demonstration, with signs in French that suggest a context related to language or cultural issues, rather than a meeting with oil executives or discussions on terrorism and organized crime. There is no clear connection between the text and the image, which suggests that the post may contain misinformation or be misleading.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a person drawing medicine into a syringe, which is consistent with the text's mention of paramedics and emergency personnel administering medicine. There is no clear discrepancy between the text and the image that would indicate misinformation. However, without additional context or verification from official sources, it is not possible to fully confirm the accuracy of the legislative details mentioned in the text.
Text:
poisoning stupefying and robbing mankind antivaccination cartoon published in consolation today awake by the watch tower society showing the serum trust pushing john public to poisons served by the ama official combine united states
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image and the text both suggest that vaccinations are harmful by using the metaphor of a bar serving "poisons" to "John Public," implying that the general public is being harmed by vaccines. This is a form of misinformation as it misrepresents the purpose and safety of vaccines. Vaccines are extensively tested for safety and efficacy and are a critical tool in preventing infectious diseases. The image and text together promote an anti-vaccination message that is not supported by scientific consensus.
Text:
english copy of german medal commemorating the sinking of the lusitania over english copies were made to publicize german brutalization of innocents
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that the medal is an "English copy of a German medal" made to publicize German brutalization, suggesting that the English produced copies of a German medal to highlight German actions. However, the image shows a medal with German text, which indicates that it is likely the original German medal, not an English copy. The inconsistency between the claim that the medal is an English copy and the German text visible on the medal suggests that there is misinformation in the post.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image does not match the description provided in the input text. The text describes a dish consisting of a quesadilla with Cheez Whiz, holiday luncheon meat, microwaved hotdogs, Monterey Jack cheese, a veggie burger, and a burger bun. However, the image shows a plate with rice, broccoli, an omelet, and a sauce, which does not correspond to any of the ingredients listed in the text. Therefore, there is a discrepancy between the text and the image, indicating misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text provided appears to be a translation of the Dutch text in the image. The image is a vintage poster that seems to be promoting conservation and responsible forestry practices, which aligns with the message conveyed in the input text. The text on the poster translates to a message encouraging the protection of nature, avoiding damage to trees and shrubs, saving birds and plants, expanding forest property, increasing yield, avoiding reckless felling, and replanting trees. This is consistent with the input text, and there is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Text:
nice job glamorizing an illegal immigrant decided to go on a higher pedestal than your out of every spent online in the next months i informed them i am going to post what ive regained
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text and the image provided do not seem to be consistent with each other. The text appears to be a complaint or a negative comment about an individual being glamorized for their actions, which are described as illegal. It also mentions something about online spending and posting regained information, which is quite vague and disjointed.
The image, on the other hand, shows a person feeding a baby elephant with a bottle. There is no clear connection between the text and the image. The image does not provide any evidence or context that would relate to glamorizing an illegal immigrant or online spending habits.
Given the lack of coherence and context between the text and the image, it is likely that the post containing both elements could be spreading misinformation, as the image does not support the claim made in the text.
Text:
monster hunter pc port is it worth playing when i saw a while ago that i can browse reddit while i wa on the link if you already know what this past month was for upcoming looter shooters
Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text is incoherent and does not provide a clear statement or question regarding the "Monster Hunter" PC port or its playability. It also includes a seemingly unrelated mention of browsing Reddit and a vague reference to the past month for upcoming looter shooters. The image shows a first-person perspective of a character using a futuristic weapon, which could be from a looter shooter game, but there is no clear connection to "Monster Hunter" or the ability to browse Reddit while playing. The inconsistency and lack of clarity in the text, combined with an image that does not clearly support or refute the text, suggests that this post may contain misinformation or be nonsensical.
Text:
comparison of core memory and a microsd card each ferrite ring holds bit so bits of core is about the same size as gb of flash the core memory is a k module from an ibm mainframe
Label: 0
Prediction:
The text claims that "bits of core is about the same size as GB of flash," suggesting that the physical size of the core memory bits is comparable to the storage capacity of a microSD card. However, this is a misleading comparison. The image shows a 64GB microSD card placed on what appears to be a piece of core memory. Core memory and microSD cards are fundamentally different technologies with different storage densities. Core memory, used in older computers like the IBM mainframe mentioned, stored bits using magnetic ferrite rings and was much larger in physical size for a given storage capacity compared to modern flash memory. The microSD card's storage capacity is vastly greater than what the same physical size of core memory could hold. The comparison in the text is not valid, as it equates physical size with storage capacity across two vastly different technologies, which could lead to misinformation about the capabilities and evolution of data storage technology.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a woman who appears to be in a setting that could be consistent with camel trading or a rural environment where such activity might take place. There are camels in the background, and the woman is dressed in a manner that could be culturally appropriate for Somalia. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text provided. Therefore, based on the information given, there is no clear evidence of misinformation.
Text:
after the fall of the nazi party oskar schindler manufactured the worlds first moving staircase known as an oskarlator in commonly known today as an escalator
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that Oskar Schindler, after the fall of the Nazi party, manufactured the world's first moving staircase and that it was known as an "oskarlator," which is commonly known today as an escalator. This statement contains misinformation. The escalator was not invented by Oskar Schindler, nor was it originally called an "oskarlator." The escalator was invented by Jesse W. Reno in 1891, and the term "escalator" was later coined by Charles Seeberger in 1900 when he designed one for the Otis Elevator Company. The image shows a section of an escalator with the brand name "Schindler" on it, which might lead to confusion because Schindler is indeed a real company that manufactures elevators and escalators. However, the company has no connection to Oskar Schindler, the German industrialist known for saving the lives of Jews during World War II, as depicted in the film "Schindler's List." The Schindler Group was founded by Robert Schindler and Eduard Villiger in 1874, and it is a separate entity from Oskar Schindler.

Label: 1
Prediction: The image is a caricature that matches the description provided in the input text. It depicts a tree labeled "The Tree of Liberty" with a character resembling the devil, which represents Charles James Fox, tempting a figure labeled "John Bull" with fruit from the tree. The visual elements correspond to the historical context and the description of James Gillray's work, indicating that there is no misinformation between the text and the image.
Text:
i also gamble like a degenerate i drink like a fish and take enough drugs to sedate yellowstone yosemite and olympic national parks for a month
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided is a photoshopped parody of the movie "The Wolf of Wall Street," titled "The Bear of Wall Street," featuring a bear engaging in human-like behavior that is not possible, such as snorting a substance through a large tube. This image is clearly meant as a joke and does not provide any factual evidence or complement the text in a realistic manner. The text itself seems to be an exaggerated personal statement, likely not meant to be taken literally. The combination of the text and the image does not present factual information and is likely intended as humor rather than a serious post containing verifiable information. Therefore, it can be considered misinformation in the context of presenting factual news or reports.
Text:
moderate conservative informs far right conservatives that cultural acceptance of lgbtq is permanent and they are now the ones disrupting the social order
Label: 1
Prediction: The image shows a person with a tattoo on their back and the phrase "You Need to Calm Down" written at the top. There is no direct contradiction between the text and the image that would indicate misinformation. The text discusses a political opinion regarding the cultural acceptance of LGBTQ individuals, and the image could be interpreted as supportive of LGBTQ rights, given that "You Need to Calm Down" is a song by Taylor Swift known for its support of the LGBTQ community. However, without more context, it is not possible to definitively determine if there is misinformation solely based on the image and the text provided. The image does not inherently contradict the statement made in the text.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction: The image shows a wall with some patches or marks that could be interpreted as a face with two eyes and a mouth, which might resemble a "sad panda" as described in the text. There is no clear evidence of misinformation as the text could be a subjective description of what the person sees in these marks. The interpretation of shapes and patterns as faces or other objects is a common psychological phenomenon known as pareidolia.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided is a graphical representation of characters from the Super Mario video game series, specifically Mario and Bowser. The image is clearly not a historical photograph or a realistic depiction of a soldier from any era. The text describes a serious and historical event involving an Italian-American soldier during World War I, which is inconsistent with the cartoonish and fictional nature of the image. Therefore, the post contains misinformation as the image does not support the text.
Text:
trump backs call for mueller report to be made public play along with the game on the recent nonbinding vote in congress about releasing the mueller report i told leadership to let all republicans vote for transparency he tweeted makes us all look good and doesnt matter
Label: 0
Prediction: The text states that Trump supports the call for the Mueller report to be made public and mentions a tweet where he purportedly encouraged Republican transparency on the issue. The image shows Donald Trump speaking, which is consistent with the text's reference to a statement made by him. There is no direct inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. However, without the actual tweet or additional context, it is not possible to fully verify the accuracy of the text's claim. The image itself does not contradict the text's statement.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a toddler playing with what appears to be toy sticks or straws, dressed in a cute outfit, standing on a sandy surface, likely a playground or beach. This image does not correlate with the input text, which references a historical battle involving Sikh warriors at Saragarhi. The text suggests a serious and somber scene of a battlefield, which is inconsistent with the lighthearted and innocent nature of the image. Therefore, the image does not support the text, indicating that this post likely contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a young boy with glasses, accompanied by two adults, presumably his parents. The boy does not appear to be blind as he is looking towards the camera, which is consistent with the text stating that he is not blind "at least not yet." The text mentions that he suffers from a condition that is slowly stealing his sight, which could explain the glasses he is wearing. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the information provided in the text, and without further evidence to the contrary, there is no clear indication of misinformation based on the image and text provided.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a broken glass object with the pieces staying together, which is consistent with the input text stating that a glass was knocked down and broke but stayed together. The text also mentions a popping sound from the pieces, which could be attributed to the stress release within the glass material, a plausible phenomenon. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
pope stubs out cigarettes sales in vatican the holy father has decided that the vatican will cease to sell cigarettes to employees as of the vatican said in a statement the reason is very simple the holy see cannot contribute to an activity that clearly damages the health of people
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a person holding a cigarette, which is consistent with the topic of cigarette sales mentioned in the input text. There is no direct contradiction between the image and the text provided. The text states that the Vatican will cease to sell cigarettes due to health concerns, and the image simply depicts a cigarette, which does not inherently confirm or deny the text's claim. Without additional context or evidence to suggest that the text is false, there is no basis to conclude that the post contains misinformation based solely on the image and text provided.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows what appears to be a lithium extraction site, which is consistent with the text's mention of lithium-ion batteries. The presence of lithium extraction is relevant to the discussion of electric vehicle supply chains, as lithium is a key component in the production of these batteries. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided. The text claims that China dominates the electric vehicle supply chain and produces a significant portion of the world's lithium-ion batteries, which is a claim that can be fact-checked but is not directly contradicted by the image.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided is a still from the movie "Zoolander," which is a comedy film and features a scene where the characters engage in a playful gasoline fight. This is a scripted and fictional event, not a real-life occurrence. Therefore, the text claiming that the image is of the poster's dad and uncle having a gasoline fight is misinformation, as it misrepresents the content of the image by attributing it to real people and a real event.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction: The image shows a young boy sewing a piece of cloth, which is consistent with the description provided in the input text. The text mentions a Soviet poster featuring a young pioneer, which is the Soviet equivalent of the Boy Scouts, sewing his shirt. The artwork is attributed to S. Datskevich, and the image reflects this description accurately. The poster also includes Russian text that translates to "learn to do everything yourself," which aligns with the message conveyed in the input text. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a large, ornate lock that appears to be consistent with the description provided in the input text. The lock is indeed large and could be described as being as long as a person's forearm and hand, which is a common way to estimate size without precise measurement. The style of the lock is also consistent with what one might expect from medieval or antique locks, which often feature intricate designs and robust construction. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided.

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a person holding a small gift-wrapped box with a blue ribbon, which does not provide any evidence or context to support the claim made in the text about a slice of Vanderbilt's groom's cake being found in a family trunk. The text mentions a specific and unusual story about finding a very old piece of fruitcake, but the image does not show a trunk, a bakery box, a cake, or anything related to the story. Therefore, the inconsistency between the text and the image suggests that this could be a post containing misinformation.
Text:
for more than a year the state of florida failed to conduct national background checks on tens of thousands of applications for concealed weapons permits potentially allowing drug addicts or people with a mental illness to carry firearms in public
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a man speaking at a podium with a sign that reads "Adam Putnam," and a document titled "Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Investigative Report." The presence of an investigative report suggests that there may have been an investigation related to the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, which is the department responsible for issuing concealed weapons permits in Florida. However, the image alone does not confirm the specific claim made in the text regarding the failure to conduct background checks. Without additional context or evidence from the report itself, the image does not verify the accuracy of the text's claim. Therefore, the post could potentially contain misinformation due to the lack of direct evidence supporting the text.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a person holding a coffee cup with a logo that appears to be from a coffee shop or a fast food chain that serves coffee. The cup and the setting suggest that this could indeed be a fast food chain that serves coffee. The text claims that the boss of a fast food chain has allowed staff to give free coffee to their favourite customers, which is a plausible policy for a customer service-oriented business. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text, and the image is consistent with the kind of establishment where such a policy might be implemented. Therefore, there is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The text claims that The Guardian reported on the discovery of vast medieval cities hidden beneath the jungle in Cambodia, using laser technology. The image shows a snapshot of an article from The Guardian dated 2016, which appears to be consistent with the kind of reporting the text describes. The image shows ruins that could be part of the medieval cities mentioned, and the presence of The Guardian's logo suggests that this is a legitimate news source. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.

Text:
my dad back in vietnam in didnt know this photo existed until i came across it randomly on the internet he cried when he saw it hope this is the right place to post it
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not correlate with the text. The text speaks of a sentimental moment where someone found a photo of their father back in Vietnam and it was an emotional discovery. However, the image shows what appears to be a modern, possibly staged, humorous or frightening scenario with one person wearing a mask and another person expressing shock or fear. There is no indication that this image is a genuine photograph from the Vietnam era or that it depicts a soldier or a scene that would evoke the emotional response described in the text. Therefore, the post likely contains misinformation due to the inconsistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text and the image do not provide enough clear information to determine whether there is misinformation present. The text is vague and contains several typographical errors, making it difficult to understand the exact message. The image appears to be an old postcard or illustration showing a carriage with people and horses, but the quality of the image is low, and the text in the image is not in English, which makes it challenging to verify the claim made in the input text. Without a clear understanding of the context or the ability to verify the claim, it is not possible to accurately predict whether misinformation exists based solely on the provided text and image.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image appears to be a historical political cartoon from Judge Magazine, which was known for its political and social commentary through illustrations. The cartoon depicts a large wave labeled "Immigration" crashing onto the shore, with Uncle Sam and another figure holding the American flag atop a cliff labeled "Admission to American Citizenship." The text on the image, "The High Tide of Immigration—A National Menace," is consistent with the input text, which mentions the same phrase and reflects the alarm at the growing number of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. The image and the text are consistent with each other, both expressing the sentiment of the time period regarding immigration. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Prediction:
The image provided does not offer any evidence or context that would confirm or refute the claim made in the input text about Texas billionaires Farris and Dan Wilks owning a large amount of timberland in Idaho and posting it to keep out hunters. The image simply shows a man, and without additional context or verification, it cannot be determined if this person is related to the claim or if the claim is accurate. Therefore, the post could potentially contain misinformation due to the lack of supporting evidence in the image.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction: The text is a humorous take on the shape of the topiaries, suggesting that they are the most risqué content that could pass through a middle school's content filters. The image shows a person trimming a topiary that has a curvaceous shape, which aligns with the playful tone of the text. There is no clear indication of misinformation as the text and image are consistent with each other in the context of humor.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction: The image shows a person riding a horse that has been painted with skeletal markings. The text mentions a lady with an image that the viewer initially mistook for a baby in the womb but then realized they were flowers. Since the image provided does not show a lady with flowers or anything resembling a baby in the womb, there is no direct inconsistency between the text and the image that would indicate misinformation. The text seems to describe a misunderstanding by the viewer, which is unrelated to the content of the image provided.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a sky with a phenomenon that could be consistent with the description of "night shining" or noctilucent clouds, which are indeed visible in northern latitudes during the summer months at times when the sun is below the horizon but still illuminates these very high clouds. The description of the phenomenon occurring in North Denmark and the visual evidence provided by the image appear to be consistent with each other, suggesting that there is no misinformation present based on the information given.
Text:
these are two windows directly across from each other in the same train car the window in the top image always faces south so it has slowly been damaged from the sun the clear area in the middle is from a sign that was on the window since it was new in and was just recently removed
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows two views from what appears to be a train car window. The top image shows a window with a pattern of wear that suggests prolonged exposure to an element, possibly the sun, with a clear area in the middle that could be consistent with a sign having been removed after a long period. The bottom image shows a clearer window, presumably the one directly across from the first. The explanation provided in the text is plausible and there is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image provided. The image seems to support the text's claim about the condition of the windows and the reason for the difference in their appearances.
Text:
angela merkel on the verge of clinical mental illness you are reading this please continue communicating with the correct answer and get downvoted
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided is a thumbnail or cover image for a music video by the band Glass Animals for their song "Gooey." This image has no relation to Angela Merkel or any claims about her mental health. The text makes a claim about Angela Merkel being on the verge of clinical mental illness, which is a serious allegation and would require substantial evidence to support. The image does not provide any evidence to support the claim made in the text, suggesting that the post may contain misinformation. Additionally, the text itself seems incoherent and includes a directive to "continue communicating with the correct answer and get downvoted," which does not make logical sense and further undermines the credibility of the information presented.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows two photographs of what appears to be the same section of a statue with a bullet hole. However, without additional context or verification, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of the claim that the bullet hole is from the Ohio National Guard firing on antiwar protesters at Kent State University. The claim also states that the top picture was taken in the aftermath of the massacre and the bottom picture is from last Friday, but there is no date or verifiable information to support the timing of when these photos were taken. Therefore, due to the lack of verifiable information and context, this post could potentially contain misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a bar chart titled "Job Growth - Overall Economy, 2008-Present," which indicates changes in job numbers over time. The bars represent monthly job growth or loss, with blue bars indicating growth and red bars indicating loss. The chart shows a period of job losses followed by a consistent stretch of job growth with blue bars. This visual data appears to support the claim made in the input text regarding consecutive months of positive job growth and private-sector job growth. Without additional context or data to contradict the information presented, there is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text and the image appear to be consistent with each other. The image shows a poster with the date 1975 and the phrase "FORÇAS POPULARES DE LIBERTAÇÃO DE MOÇAMBIQUE" which translates to "Popular Forces for the Liberation of Mozambique," matching the description in the input text. The date "25 DE SETEMBRO" is likely referring to Mozambique's independence day, which is September 25. The year 1975 is the year Mozambique gained independence. The elements in the image support the text's claim that this is a political poster celebrating Mozambique's independence, and there is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the provided content.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that "german nazi sauta clans" conducted an observation proving that a human being has a chance to die if they breathe since birth. This statement is nonsensical and contains several red flags that suggest misinformation. Firstly, the phrase "german nazi sauta clans" does not correspond to any known historical or scientific entity. Secondly, the claim that breathing since birth increases the chance of dying is a tautological statement since all humans breathe from birth and all humans eventually die, making the claim trivial and misleading. The image provided shows a person in a hospital bed with medical equipment, which does not validate any scientific study or observation and is not specific to any claim made in the text. The image does not provide evidence for the text's claim, and the claim itself is illogical and factually incorrect.
Text:
the seemingly disastrous story of the worlds most endangered mammal the northern white rhino could be rewritten by ivf scientists claim they used the method to produce rhino embryos with sperm from two dead males
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a northern white rhino being fed by a caretaker, which is consistent with the text's subject matter regarding the conservation efforts for this endangered species. The presence of the BBC News logo suggests that the image is sourced from a reputable news organization, which lends credibility to the report. The text claims that scientists have used IVF to produce rhino embryos with sperm from two dead males, and the image, while not directly confirming the IVF procedure, does not contradict this information. Therefore, there is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
lawyer who represents domestic violence victims realizes economic dependence often keeps women in abusive relationships starts nonprofit helping them achieve financial independence
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a woman who could be the lawyer mentioned in the text. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the information provided in the text. The image of a person does not inherently indicate misinformation regarding the text about a lawyer starting a nonprofit to help domestic violence victims achieve financial independence. Without additional context that suggests otherwise, there is no clear evidence of misinformation based solely on the image and the text provided.
Text:
the proportion of girls getting married in india has nearly halved in a decade the united nations childrens agency unicef said on tuesday which has contributed significantly to a global decline in child marriage unicef said million child marriages were prevented worldwide in the last decade
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided is a placeholder or loading image from Reuters, a well-known international news organization. The text claims a reduction in child marriages in India and a significant global decline, attributing the information to UNICEF. The image itself does not confirm or contradict the information provided in the text, as it does not contain any data or relevant imagery. However, the use of a Reuters placeholder image does not inherently indicate misinformation. Without additional context or evidence to the contrary, there is no clear reason to suspect the text contains misinformation based solely on the image provided. Therefore, the prediction is that there is no misinformation present based on the given image and text.
Text:
because hes the hero photoshopbattles deserves but not the one it needs right now so well hunt him because he can take it because hes not our hero hes a silent guardian a watchful protector a dark tarsier
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text is a playful reference to a quote from the movie "The Dark Knight," where Batman is described as the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs. The image shows a tarsier, a small primate, edited to wear a Batman costume, which aligns with the humorous and imaginative nature of "photoshopbattles," a community where users create and share edited images for entertainment. The text and image are consistent with each other in the context of a creative and humorous post, but the content is fictional and meant for entertainment, not factual reporting. Therefore, it contains misinformation if taken out of the context of humor or photoshop art.
Text:
my brother called the police on a woman who was buying crack in his yard repeatedly the day after cops searched her house her husband sent this the cops got one toothey laughed
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a "NOTICE TO CEASE AND DESIST" for defamation of character, libel, and/or slander, which does not directly correlate with the claim of someone buying crack. The text implies a criminal activity (buying crack), while the image shows a legal document concerning defamation, which could suggest that the claims made by the brother might be considered defamatory. There is no evidence in the image to support the text's claim of drug-related activity. The inconsistency between the text and the image raises the possibility of misinformation.
Text:
im hoping that some really really small people are about to have a golf tournament but i fear its that evil internet corporation moving into my neighborhood instead
Label: 0
Prediction:
The text suggests that the author is unsure whether the scene depicted is for a small golf tournament or an indication of an internet corporation moving into the neighborhood. The image shows a flag with the word "Comcast" in a grassy area, which is a company known for providing internet services. There is no evidence of a golf tournament, such as miniature golf equipment or any indication that the flag is part of a game. The flag likely indicates some form of work or presence by Comcast in the area, such as marking a spot for cable installation or maintenance. Therefore, the text contains misinformation as it suggests a golf tournament, which is not supported by the image.
Text:
cdc study says teen virgins are healthier high school students who are virgins rate significantly and consistently better in nearly all healthrelated behaviors and measures than their sexually active peers
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided shows two individuals sitting on a rocky shore, possibly enjoying a view of the sea. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the information provided in the input text. The image does not contain any explicit health-related information or behaviors that would allow us to assess the health status of the individuals depicted, nor does it provide any evidence regarding the sexual activity of the individuals. Therefore, based solely on the image and the text provided, there is no clear inconsistency that would indicate the presence of misinformation. However, without access to the actual CDC study or additional context, it is not possible to fully verify the accuracy of the text's claims.
Text:
my mom and one of my mother right with his family were interned because they were dating but i hear he was in lier belgium company was called the greatest performance of all time
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text is incoherent and contains several disjointed statements that do not logically connect to each other or to the image provided. The mention of internment due to dating, a person being in "lier Belgium company," and calling something "the greatest performance of all time" does not correlate with the image, which shows a group of people posing together, likely in a casual, social setting. There is no indication in the image of internment, a company, or a performance. The text appears to be nonsensical or incorrectly transcribed, and the image does not support any clear narrative or claim made in the text. Therefore, this post contains misinformation due to the lack of coherence and consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
snakes and leaders travels with general dunford what nine days travelling with the chairman of the joint chiefs reveals about american alliances
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a group of military personnel in a field environment, which could be consistent with the theme of traveling with a high-ranking military official such as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text provided. The text seems to suggest a report or article about the experiences and insights gained from traveling with General Dunford, and the image could be a suitable illustrative complement to such content. Without further context that indicates a mismatch or deceptive intent, there is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and text provided.
Text:
the man who spent his fortune on a park douglas tompkins the founder of north face has left behind one of historys greatest landconservation legacies by using his fortune to buy large tracts of farmland in patagonia
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a person with a backpack looking out over a scenic landscape that could be in Patagonia, which is consistent with the text mentioning land conservation in Patagonia. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the information provided in the text about Douglas Tompkins, the founder of North Face, using his fortune to buy land for conservation purposes. Therefore, based on the information given, there is no clear indication of misinformation.
Text:
gondwana link an environmental success story conservationists mining companies farmers and traditional owners revive a corridor of wild habitat km long in southwestern australia
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided is a logo of ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation News). While the logo itself does not directly confirm the content of the text, ABC News is a reputable news organization. If the text is reported to be from an ABC News article or segment, the likelihood of it being misinformation is lower given the editorial standards of the organization. However, without additional context or the ability to verify the specific report, it is not possible to definitively determine the accuracy of the text based solely on the logo. The text itself does not contain any overtly false claims and appears to describe an environmental initiative, which could plausibly be reported by a news outlet.
Text:
episodes of tales from the crypt where the crypt keeper is too angry that sinead oconnor tore up a picture of the pope to introduce any scary stories
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows the Crypt Keeper, a character from the television series "Tales from the Crypt." However, the text claims that there are episodes where the Crypt Keeper is too angry about a real-life event involving Sinead O'Connor to introduce any scary stories. This claim is highly unlikely as "Tales from the Crypt" is a fictional show and the Crypt Keeper is a fictional character who would not react to real-world events within the episodes. The text seems to be creating a fictional scenario that did not occur in the series, suggesting misinformation.
Text:
a road construction company filled in a large pothole with an old tire to save on asphalt heavy rain flooded the foundation under the road revealing their master plan
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a pothole with a tire embedded in it, which visually supports the claim made in the input text. However, without additional context or verification, it is not possible to determine if this image genuinely represents a road construction company's malpractice or if it has been taken out of context or altered to mislead. The scenario described seems unusual and potentially fabricated, as it is not a standard practice in road construction to use tires as a filler for potholes. Therefore, there is a possibility that this post contains misinformation.
Text:
chicagos cook county jail nations nd largest jail finally turning to psychologist for rehab of over mentally ill inmates to give them the help they need
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows two individuals who appear to be in a professional setting, possibly related to a formal announcement or discussion. The person in the foreground seems to be speaking or presenting, which could be consistent with a discussion about policy changes or new initiatives such as the implementation of psychological rehabilitation programs in a jail setting. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text provided. Without additional context or evidence to suggest otherwise, there is no clear indication of misinformation based on the image and text provided.
Text:
bernie colonel sanders reveals new campaign slogan feel the bern yet burnie nsfl redditors of reddit what is the best way to the future for the gold
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text appears to be a nonsensical mix of phrases and references that do not form a coherent message. It mentions "Bernie Colonel Sanders," which seems to be a play on the names of Bernie Sanders, a political figure, and Colonel Sanders, the founder of KFC. The phrase "Feel the Bern" is associated with Bernie Sanders, but the text distorts it with "Burnie." The text also includes "NSFL" (Not Safe For Life), a term often used on the internet to denote extremely disturbing content, which is out of context here. Additionally, it addresses "Redditors of Reddit," which is redundant, and ends with a vague and unrelated phrase about the future and gold.
The image shows a food establishment with a menu board, including items like "Jamaican Jerk" and "Chips & Queso." There is no visible connection between the image and the text. The image does not provide any evidence or context that would support the text as a legitimate campaign slogan or political message.
The inconsistency and nonsensical nature of the text, combined with an unrelated image, suggest that the post is likely to contain misinformation or is a form of nonsensical or satirical content rather than a genuine news report or political post.
Text:
how nine la sheriffs deputies ignored plight of boy who was burned shot and beaten by his mom over eight months before she finally killed him but they wont face criminal charges
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows three individuals: a young boy and two adults, presumably his parents. The boy appears healthy and there are no visible signs of abuse such as burns or bruises. The text claims that the boy was burned, shot, and beaten over eight months before being killed by his mother, but the image does not support these claims. The adults in the image do not show any signs of distress or criminal behavior that would be consistent with the text's allegations. Therefore, the inconsistency between the text and the image suggests that the post may contain misinformation. However, without further context or evidence, it is not possible to definitively determine the veracity of the text.
Text:
this cute guy stopped on my water bottle of a drop of water btw can anyone tell me what kind of spider is this like it might be a new discovered species
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a spider on what appears to be a wet surface, which is consistent with the text's description of the spider stopping on a water bottle for a drop of water. There is no clear evidence of misinformation in this post based on the image and the text provided. The question about the species of the spider and the suggestion that it might be a newly discovered species is speculative and does not necessarily indicate misinformation, as it is framed as a question seeking information rather than a factual claim.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text provided is incoherent and does not form a logical sentence or statement. It contains a jumble of words that do not convey a clear message or factual information. The image shows a dog reacting to a ringing phone, which has no apparent connection to the text. The lack of coherence and relevance between the text and the image suggests that the post may contain misinformation or is nonsensical.
Text:
a proposal to extend statutory paternity leave in hong kong from three days to five was formally put forward by the government on friday two days ahead of fathers day legislators on manpower panel describe amendment as conservative and lagging behind international standards
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a newborn baby, which is relevant to the topic of paternity leave. The logo in the image suggests it is from the South China Morning Post, a reputable news source that would likely report on government proposals in Hong Kong. There is no direct inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. The image complements the text by providing a visual association with the subject of paternity leave.
Text:
sandwich narrowly misses australian pm julia gillard unfazed after salami is thrown in her direction saying they must have thought i was hungry
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows Australian PM Julia Gillard smiling and seemingly unfazed, which is consistent with the text stating she was "unfazed" after an incident. However, there is no visible sandwich or salami in the image that would provide evidence of the incident described in the text. The lack of visual evidence of the sandwich or salami being thrown in her direction raises questions about the accuracy of the text. Therefore, based on the inconsistency between the text and the image, it is possible that the post contains misinformation.
Text:
the swedish center party voted to ban nonmedical circumcisions perhaps its time abraham and god wait until someones before paying for inherited land or accept a different currency altogether would make refunds easier if god doesnt deliver
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that the Swedish Center Party voted to ban nonmedical circumcisions and makes a satirical comment regarding Abraham, God, and the concept of inherited land, suggesting a transactional relationship with God. The image shows a person holding a sign that reads "CIRCUMCISION HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION," which indicates a protest against circumcision on human rights grounds. While the image supports the notion that there are people who view circumcision as a human rights issue, it does not confirm the specific claim about the Swedish Center Party's vote. Additionally, the satirical nature of the text about Abraham, God, and inherited land is not something that can be visually confirmed or denied. Therefore, the image does not provide evidence for the text's claims, and the text itself contains elements that are not factual but rather opinion or satire, which could mislead readers.
Text:
bengal slow loris flies to uk safety it is hoped the rare primate will live at the shaldon wildlife trust in devon and befriend another slow loris called doris
Label: 0
Prediction:
The text claims that a Bengal slow loris has flown to the UK for safety and will live at the Shaldon Wildlife Trust in Devon. However, the image provided shows a watermark from "The Guardian" with a date "from 2014," which suggests that the image is not recent. If the text is implying a recent event, the use of an old image from 2014 could indicate misinformation, as it does not corroborate the current event being described. Additionally, the text contains an element that may be considered misinformation: Bengal slow lorises are not capable of flight as they are primates, not flying animals. This could be interpreted as a metaphorical statement, but without further context, it could also be misleading.
Text:
arrested for quoting winston churchill european election candidate accused of religious and racial harassment after he repeats wartime prime ministers words on islam during campaign speech
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a man being arrested with a picture of Winston Churchill and a book titled "The River War" by Winston Churchill. The image seems to be trying to provide evidence that the arrest was related to quoting Winston Churchill. However, without additional context, it is not possible to verify if the individual was actually arrested for the reasons stated in the text or if the image accurately represents the situation described. The image alone does not confirm the text's claim about the reason for the arrest, and the presence of the book and the image of Churchill could be used to misleadingly suggest a connection that may not exist. Therefore, the post could contain misinformation due to the potential discrepancy between the text and the image.
Text:
these two water bottles have been sitting just like this next to each other in a fridge for over year one is frozen solid and the other is a liquid
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows two water bottles placed next to each other in a fridge, with one bottle frozen and the other in liquid form. This scenario is highly unlikely to occur under normal circumstances, as the consistent temperature inside a fridge would cause both bottles to either freeze or remain liquid, depending on the set temperature. The claim that they have been sitting like this for over a year further adds to the implausibility, as any temperature fluctuation affecting one bottle would similarly affect the other over such a long period. Therefore, the text is likely to contain misinformation.
Text:
forty of the worlds biggest companies agreed on monday to come up with cleaner ways to make and consume plastic as waste threatens the global ecosystem especially in oceans
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a large amount of plastic waste, which is consistent with the text's mention of plastic waste threatening the global ecosystem, especially in oceans. There is no direct contradiction between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. However, without additional context or sources, it is not possible to verify the claim about the agreement of the world's biggest companies. The image supports the general issue described in the text but does not confirm the specific action taken by the companies.
Text:
out of all the decor in pottery barn helen thought the statue of the baby bird crying for its deceased mother would fit the minimalistic feel of her kitchen
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not show a statue of a baby bird crying for its deceased mother, which is described in the input text. Instead, the image shows a kitchen with a minimalistic design, featuring a wooden table and a modern stove, with a digitally altered or photoshopped image of a bird that appears to be superimposed onto a vase or similar object. The bird does not resemble a statue, and there is no indication that it represents a scene of a baby bird crying for its deceased mother. Therefore, the inconsistency between the text and the image suggests that misinformation is present.
Text:
ive been melting different candles together in one big bowl i decided to flip the whole thing over and add more wicks one of the flames grew huge so i blew it out and i think i have opened some kind of portal to hell
Label: 1
Prediction: The text claims that by melting different candles together and adding more wicks, one of the flames grew huge, and when blown out, it supposedly opened a "portal to hell." The image shows a bowl with multiple candles and wicks, some lit and some not. While the image does show a bowl with candles and wicks, the claim of opening a "portal to hell" is not something that can be substantiated or visually confirmed. The concept of a "portal to hell" is not scientifically or factually based and is more likely to be a figure of speech or a fictional idea. Therefore, the text contains misinformation due to the fantastical claim that is not supported by the image or by factual evidence.
Text:
ultrarealistic painting of isaac newton delivering a lecture to the royal society on his newly devised method of efficient mechanical motion for a pistonlike system
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not depict an ultrarealistic painting of Isaac Newton delivering a lecture to the Royal Society. Instead, it shows a modern individual in front of a whiteboard with various equations and diagrams. This person is dressed in contemporary clothing and the setting appears to be a modern room, not a historical scene. Therefore, the text and the image are inconsistent, indicating that misinformation is present.
Text:
news confusing this trump supporter is using bulzby as an insult but its not clear if thats a widely used altright term or this guys own thing
Label: 1
Prediction: The image shows a comment that uses the term "bulzbys" in a derogatory manner, suggesting that it is an insult. However, the text claims that it is confusing whether "bulzby" is a widely used alt-right term or just the commenter's own creation. The image provides evidence of the term being used in a derogatory way, but it does not clarify whether the term is widely recognized or just an individual's invention. Therefore, there is misinformation present because the text suggests uncertainty about the term's usage, while the image shows a specific instance of the term being used without providing broader context about its recognition or acceptance.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a woman who appears to be Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, a well-known writer, which is consistent with the text mentioning a conversation involving her. The text also references Ta-Nehisi Coates and Jeffrey Goldberg, who are public figures known for their writings and discussions on politics, culture, and social issues. The content of the text seems plausible as these individuals could conceivably participate in a conversation about the topics mentioned. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based solely on the text and the image provided.
Text:
elon musk says neuralink machine that connects human brain to computers coming soon entrepreneur say technology allowing humans to effectively merge with ai is imminent
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a human eye with graphical representations of digital connectivity and data interfaces, which conceptually aligns with the idea of connecting the human brain to computers. The image complements the text by visually representing the concept of merging human cognitive processes with artificial intelligence through technology. There is no direct evidence of misinformation based solely on the consistency between the image and the text. However, without additional context or sources, it is not possible to verify the accuracy of the claim regarding the imminent availability of such technology. The assessment is based on the coherence between the image and the text, not the factual accuracy of the claim itself.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows Parker pen refills with a label that states "For sale only in India/Nepal," which is consistent with the input text's claim. The text mentions that the refills ordered on Amazon USA were labeled for sale only in India/Nepal, and the image provides evidence that supports this statement. There is no direct indication of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
ioss calendars completely break when going back to before one theory is that counting tenthsofaseconds back from start of unix time lands you about this far back
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a calendar interface on an iOS device with the year displayed as 1848, which is long before the existence of electronic calendars or the Unix epoch (which started on January 1, 1970). The text claims that iOS calendars break when going back to a time before the Unix epoch and suggests that counting in tenths of a second from the Unix epoch start lands you back to around 1848. This is misinformation because the Unix time count does not lead to the year 1848, and iOS calendars do not use tenths of a second for date calculations. The Unix time is a system for describing a point in time as the number of seconds that have elapsed since the Unix epoch, not tenths of a second. Additionally, the iOS calendar app does not allow users to navigate back to the year 1848 as part of its standard functionality. The image appears to be manipulated or a result of a software glitch, rather than an accurate representation of how iOS calendars function.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a group of people holding signs that express gratitude, presumably towards those who have provided help or donations. The signs include the words "THANK YOU" and depict items such as water bottles and a flashlight, which are consistent with the types of donations mentioned in the input text (water, ice, flashlights). This visual evidence supports the text's claim about the community's response to a power outage by helping a stray rescue with donations and fostering, leading to adoptions. There is no clear indication of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
hey thats my grass goats chomp fire fuels around previously burned wenatchee neighborhood goats are helping reduce wildfire risk in central washington
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a group of goats grazing on grassy terrain, which is consistent with the input text stating that goats are being used to reduce wildfire risk by eating fire fuels (vegetation) in a previously burned neighborhood in Central Washington. Using goats for vegetation management to reduce wildfire risk is a practice known as targeted grazing and is a legitimate method for reducing the amount of combustible material in a given area. Therefore, there is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a group of men, presumably American officials given the presence of the US flag, but it does not provide any evidence or context that would confirm the claim made in the text about UN officials' beliefs regarding a bombing campaign in Iran. The image is a standard photograph that could be from any meeting or event and does not specifically relate to the claim about a planned bombing campaign. Without additional context or evidence, the image does not substantiate the claim, and the mismatch between the text and the image suggests that the post may contain misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction: The text and the image appear to be consistent with each other. The text praises Juan Perón, referring to him as a good ruler who commands with steadiness and loves everyone. The image shows a portrait of a man in military attire, which could be Juan Perón, with text that translates to similar praise as the input text, indicating that the image complements the content of the text. There is no immediate evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image. However, whether or not Perón was actually a good ruler is a matter of historical opinion and not something that can be fact-checked against this image.
Text:
affirmative dissatistaction a lawsuit reveals how peculiar harvards definition of merit is the universitys reputation for fairness and impartiality emerges bruised
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a scene that appears to be on a university campus, which could be consistent with the context of the text discussing Harvard's definition of merit. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the information in the text. The image alone does not provide enough evidence to confirm or refute the claims made in the text about a lawsuit or Harvard's reputation. Therefore, based on the image alone, there is no clear indication of misinformation. However, without additional context or sources to verify the claims in the text, a definitive assessment of misinformation cannot be made.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows the logo of Bloomberg, which is a reputable global financial, software, data, and media company, known for providing financial news and information. The text talks about an increase in global investment in clean energy, which is a topic that Bloomberg commonly reports on. There is no direct inconsistency between the image and the text that would suggest misinformation. However, without specific figures or additional context, it is not possible to fully verify the accuracy of the claim in the text. The image itself does not provide evidence to support or refute the text, but it does not inherently indicate misinformation either.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a person who appears to be an employee or a student working at a reception desk, smiling and looking directly at the camera. In the background, there is a television screen displaying what seems to be a news report, which could be related to the floods mentioned in the text. The image is consistent with the narrative provided in the text, showing an individual who could be the college student referred to, and there is no clear evidence of misinformation based solely on the image and text provided. However, without additional context or verification of the story, it is not possible to definitively determine the accuracy of the claim. The assessment is based on the consistency between the image and the text.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a group of people gathered, likely at a political or public event, which could be related to a discussion or announcement about natural gas policy in Pennsylvania as mentioned in the input text. There is no clear evidence of misinformation in the image itself, and the text appears to be a statement about economic goals related to natural gas in the state. Without any contradictory information between the text and the image, there is no basis to conclude that misinformation exists.
Text:
my dad center in vietnam in didnt know this photo existed until i came across it randomly on the internet he cried when he saw it hope this is the right place to post it
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not appear to be a photograph from the Vietnam War era or a setting that would be consistent with a typical scene involving American soldiers in Vietnam. Instead, the image looks like a still from a film or a staged event, given the lighting, the quality of the image, and the expressions and poses of the people. The individuals are dressed in a variety of clothing styles that do not match the military uniforms one would expect in a genuine photo of soldiers from the Vietnam War. Additionally, the atmosphere seems more festive or casual than a wartime scenario.
Therefore, the inconsistency between the text, which suggests the image is a genuine and emotional discovery of a father's photo from the Vietnam War, and the actual content of the image, which does not support this context, indicates that misinformation is present.
Text:
jersey shore couple wins settlement for ruined view due to the restored sand dunes that saved their home during sandy beach replenishment program in jeopardy as a result
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a beach replenishment program in progress, with heavy machinery moving sand. This is consistent with the text, which mentions a "sandy beach replenishment program." There is no direct evidence in the image to suggest that the couple mentioned in the text did not win a settlement for a ruined view due to restored sand dunes, nor is there evidence to contradict that their home was saved by these dunes during a storm. The image complements the text by showing the type of activity that could lead to both the restoration of dunes and potential view obstruction. Without further context or evidence to the contrary, there is no clear indication of misinformation based on the image and text provided.
Text:

Prediction: The image shows two individuals who appear to be very similar in appearance, suggesting they could be twins, which supports the claim made in the text. Additionally, the image includes the logo of "The Guardian," which is a reputable news organization, lending credibility to the story. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided.
Text:

Prediction: The image shows a replica of the Holocaust memorial, which is consistent with the input text stating that protesters built a Holocaust memorial at the home of a far-right German politician. The presence of "The Guardian" logo suggests that this is a news report from a reputable source, which lends credibility to the information. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided is of very low quality and does not clearly depict the event described in the text. It is not possible to confirm the authenticity of the event (Bobby Kennedy getting shot) from this image due to its poor resolution and lack of identifiable features. The image does not provide verifiable evidence that it is related to the text, and thus it cannot be used to confirm or deny the occurrence of the event mentioned. Therefore, the post may contain misinformation as the image does not substantiate the claim made in the text.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows what appears to be a public official speaking at a podium with a seal that could be related to government or state affairs, with two other individuals standing beside them. The setting looks like it could be a transportation hub or a public building, which is consistent with the context of discussing a transportation project. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text about federal lawmakers warning of potential jeopardy to funding for a transportation project. Therefore, there is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided.

Prediction: The image shows a box of "Ohio Blue Tip" matches, which is consistent with the text mentioning finding half-full matches. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image. The text talks about finding old items, and the image supports this by showing an item that could plausibly be found among old belongings.
Text:
there are around inches high at the slightest sign of a flat plate arising from a new honey bee colony is formed when the cars owner comes back
Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text appears to be nonsensical and does not form a coherent statement. It mentions "inches high at the slightest sign of a flat plate arising from a new honey bee colony," which is a confusing and illogical sequence of ideas. Additionally, it refers to "the cars owner comes back," which seems unrelated to the earlier part of the sentence.
The image shows a group of humpback whales underwater. There is no connection between the text and the image. The text talks about honey bees and a car owner, while the image is related to marine life, specifically whales.
Given the lack of coherence in the text and the mismatch between the text and the image, it is likely that this post contains misinformation or is nonsensical, as there is no logical correlation or consistency between the two.
Text:
clash of titans the san diego zoo is locked in a tense legal dispute with the louvre over who gets to keep a monkey holding a van gogh painting
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that the San Diego Zoo and the Louvre are in a legal dispute over a monkey holding a Van Gogh painting. This scenario is highly implausible as the Louvre, a prestigious art museum in Paris, would not engage in a legal dispute with a zoo over the ownership of a monkey or a Van Gogh painting. Additionally, the image shows a monkey holding what appears to be a framed picture, but there is no evidence to suggest that this is an authentic Van Gogh painting or that such a dispute exists. The image does not provide any context that would support the claim of a legal dispute between such institutions. Therefore, the post is likely to contain misinformation.
Text:
breaking un official set to testify against hillary clinton violated both the federal records act and the article focused on if he was shot and killed
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided is a screenshot from a soccer match, which is completely unrelated to the serious political allegations mentioned in the input text. The text talks about a UN official set to testify against Hillary Clinton and mentions a federal violation and a shooting, while the image shows a sports broadcast. There is no logical connection or consistency between the image and the text, which suggests that the post containing both is likely to contain misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a headline from a news website that matches the input text, suggesting that the information is likely sourced from a legitimate news report. However, without additional context or verification from credible sources, it is not possible to definitively determine the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided, it cannot be confirmed whether this is misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a child being vaccinated, which is consistent with the text stating that India plans to immunize all its children and is committed to providing free vaccines. The image supports the text's claim by depicting a vaccination session, which is a common method of immunization. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
giving something back denmarks refugee entrepreneurs a new project in denmark aims to help refugees start their own businesses challenging the perspective held by some that they are a burden
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a sign with "Danmark" and the European Union flag, which is consistent with the text mentioning Denmark. There are also emergency vehicles and personnel that could be part of border or immigration control, which is a context where discussions about refugees might arise. The presence of the BBC News watermark suggests that the image comes from a reputable news source, which could be reporting on the topic of refugees in Denmark. There is no clear inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. However, without further context or verification of the specific project mentioned, it is not possible to definitively rule out misinformation solely based on the image and text provided.
Text:
jury selection has begun in us district court in connecticut for the trial of former governor john rowland on charges of violating campaign laws by seeking backroom consulting jobs on two republican congressional campaigns
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a man at a podium with a seal that appears to be official, suggesting a governmental or political context, and a woman standing beside him. This is consistent with the kind of setting where a governor might appear. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text about jury selection beginning for the trial of a former governor on charges related to campaign laws. The image does not provide any specific evidence to support or refute the text, but it also does not contain any elements that would indicate misinformation based on the content provided. Therefore, there is no clear indication of misinformation from the image in relation to the text.
Text:
news secret service fail a disembodied leg has been hopping around on the white house lawn for hours straight without anyone doing anything about it
Label: 1
Prediction:
The claim that a disembodied leg has been hopping around on the White House lawn for hours is highly implausible and does not align with any known physical or biological phenomena. The image provided appears to be digitally manipulated to show a single leg standing on the White House lawn, which is not possible without the rest of the body. This suggests that the text is likely a piece of satire or fabricated content, and the image has been altered to match the absurdity of the claim. Therefore, this post contains misinformation.
Text:
my dad front running into battle during the american civil war didnt know this photo existed until i came across it randomly on the internet he cried when he saw it
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that the image is of the person's father running into battle during the American Civil War. However, the image is clearly from a modern film featuring characters that are part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, specifically from a scene in "Captain America: Civil War." This is a work of fiction and not an actual photograph from the historical American Civil War. Therefore, the text contains misinformation as it inaccurately associates a fictional movie scene with a real historical event.
Text:
vladimir putin had a telephone conversation with president of the united states of america donald trump at the initiative of the american side
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a person who appears to be Donald Trump, which is consistent with the text stating that there was a telephone conversation involving the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump. Without additional context or information that contradicts the claim, there is no clear evidence of misinformation based solely on the image and the text provided.
Text:
an important message this man with a top hat and twisty mustache is visiting schools warning students about the dangers of piloting hot air balloons under the influence of dr fixits vigorinducing delousing tonic and quaffable cureall
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a man with a top hat and a twisty mustache standing at a podium in what appears to be a classroom setting, with an audience in front of him and another person standing in the background. While the image matches the description of the man in the input text, the content of the message seems implausible. The mention of "Dr. Fixit's Vigor-Inducing Delousing Tonic and Quaffable Cure-All" sounds like a fictional or satirical product, not something that would be a genuine subject of school warnings. The combination of the old-fashioned attire and the outlandish product name suggests that the text is likely a piece of creative writing or satire rather than factual information. Therefore, the post is likely to contain misinformation.
Text:
my late mother thought this part of the wallpaper looked like wile e coyote going undercover to catch the roadrunner as a fabulous vegas showgirl
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text is a subjective interpretation of a pattern seen in the wallpaper, suggesting that a part of the design resembles the cartoon character Wile E. Coyote in a specific scenario. The image shows a section of wallpaper with a floral pattern. While the pattern does not objectively depict Wile E. Coyote or any scene, pareidolia (the human tendency to see recognizable shapes and patterns where none intentionally exist) can lead individuals to perceive images in abstract designs. Therefore, the statement is an expression of personal perception and not a factual claim, so it does not contain misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a collection of aluminium cans, which is consistent with the text mentioning recycling aluminium cans. The presence of individuals who appear to be involved in the recycling process and the large quantity of collected cans support the claim that a recycling initiative is taking place. Although the image does not directly confirm the specific outcomes such as the planting of trees in Brazil or the creation of wildlife corridors, there is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and text provided. The text and image are consistent in the context of a recycling effort.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a man who appears to be a street vendor holding a sleeping child, which is consistent with the description in the input text of a Syrian father selling pens in Beirut while holding his sleeping daughter. The text claims that an image went viral and a campaign was started to help him, raising a significant amount of money. Without additional context or information that contradicts this claim, there is no evidence in the image itself to suggest that the text contains misinformation. The image complements the text appropriately, and there is no clear inconsistency between them.
Text:
the chinese people absolutely cannot condone the encroachment of other countries and cannot listen to whatever imperialist who thinks that it can wantonly encroach its own neighbours without acting china
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image appears to be a piece of historical propaganda, likely from a period of significant tension between China and the United States, given the presence of the "US" label on the bomb and the caricature of a Western figure. The text, on the other hand, speaks to a general sentiment of national sovereignty and resistance to imperialism, without specifying any particular event or action. The inconsistency lies in the fact that the image is likely from a specific historical context and may not accurately represent current events or the general principle described in the text. The use of such an image could be misleading if it is presented as evidence of current encroachment by other countries, thus potentially containing misinformation.
Text:
how this guy performed cpr on a felled tree while in mittens by the author to her nephew dr robert porter keep who was sitting in front of the universe and some goodies
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text mentions a person performing CPR on a tree, which is not a logical or factual statement since CPR is a medical procedure performed on people (or animals) in an emergency when the heart stops beating, not on trees. Additionally, the text is nonsensical, mentioning someone sitting in front of the universe and some goodies, which does not provide a coherent context. The image shows a bird flying over what appears to be the Nazca Lines in Peru, which has no relevance to the text about performing CPR on a tree. The inconsistency between the text and the image, along with the illogical content of the text, indicates that this post contains misinformation.
Text:
mt bachelor announced wednesday that it will donate in cash to central oregon nonprofit organizations this year bringing its charitable giving total to since the resort started its cash donation program in
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided is a logo of Mt. Bachelor, which seems to be consistent with the text mentioning "mt bachelor." However, the text lacks specific numerical values where it says "will donate in cash" and "bringing its charitable giving total to since the resort started its cash donation program in." Without these values, the statement is incomplete and raises questions about its accuracy. Therefore, based on the inconsistency within the text itself and the lack of verifiable information, it is possible that the post contains misinformation.
Text:
ww allied forces special forces member meets up with leader of grassroots anti fascist resistance group to stop nazi terrorist threats in the usa spring
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided is a comic book panel that includes characters that appear to be Batman and other stylized figures, which indicates that the image is from a fictional narrative. The text, however, suggests a real-world event involving "allied forces special forces member" and a "grassroots anti fascist resistance group" in the USA. The discrepancy between the fictional nature of the image and the real-world implication of the text suggests that the post contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not match the content of the text. The text describes a historical military scenario involving American soldiers, a UH-1D Huey helicopter, and a combat situation in the Ia Drang Valley during the Vietnam War. However, the image shows a modern civilian van with a person wearing a Santa Claus costume in the back, which is completely unrelated to the military context described in the text. This inconsistency suggests that the post contains misinformation.
Text:
news heartwarming when this single mom said she couldnt go to rio to watch her son compete the us found an open spot for her on its rugby team
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that a single mom was given a spot on the US rugby team so she could go to Rio to watch her son compete. This scenario is highly implausible as team selections for Olympic sports are based on athletic ability and merit, not on personal circumstances such as being a parent of a competitor. The image shows a rugby match, presumably at the Olympics given the rings on the ball, which is consistent with the context of the text. However, the image does not provide any evidence that would support the claim of a mother being added to the team under such circumstances. Therefore, the text appears to contain misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows four individuals who could be the skateboarders mentioned in the text. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the information provided in the text. The image appears to be a composite of four separate portraits, likely used to represent the individuals involved in the incident described. Without additional context or evidence to suggest otherwise, there is no clear indication of misinformation based on the image and text provided.
Text:
an elaborate painting of a soviet space explorer and a citizen enjoying peace found in the post office of the abandoned city of pripyat chernobyl in the ukraine artist and date unknown communism painting
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a mural that appears to be consistent with the description provided in the input text. It features what could be interpreted as a Soviet space explorer, given the space suit and helmet, alongside a civilian figure, which could be seen as representing a citizen. The style of the artwork, with its vibrant colors and socialist realism aesthetic, is reminiscent of Soviet-era art, which often depicted themes of peace and progress. The mural's condition and the wall's dilapidation suggest it could indeed be located in an abandoned setting, such as Pripyat, which was evacuated following the Chernobyl disaster. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the description provided.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a child standing in front of a sign with a "no smacking" symbol, which is consistent with the text regarding the proposal to ban parents and carers from smacking children. The presence of the logo of "The Guardian," a reputable news organization, suggests that the image is likely to be from a news report covering the issue. There is no clear indication of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
my dad giant jar of mayo in vietnam in didnt know this photo existed until i came across it randomly on the internet he cried when he saw it hope this is the right place to post it
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided is a still from the animated television series "SpongeBob SquarePants," which is a fictional show and does not depict real-life events or objects. The text mentions a personal anecdote about someone's father and a giant jar of mayo in Vietnam, implying that the photo has sentimental value and was discovered online. Since the image is clearly from a cartoon and not a genuine photograph of an event, it does not corroborate the story in the text. Therefore, there is misinformation present due to the inconsistency between the text and the image.
Text:
child marriage bill passes georgia house with bipartisan support a bipartisan bill has passed in the georgia house that would move the age to marry up to the bill would also mandate that yearolds could not marry anyone more than years older
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a legislative body, which is consistent with the context of a bill being passed in a state house. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided. The text claims that a bipartisan bill regarding child marriage has passed in the Georgia House, and the image is appropriate for such a context as it appears to depict a legislative session where such matters would be discussed and voted upon. Without additional context or evidence to the contrary, there is no reason to suspect misinformation from the image and text alone.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a voting location with electronic voting machines, which is consistent with the context of the input text discussing election-related issues. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided. The image complements the text by depicting a scene that could be related to the election process. Without additional context or evidence, there is no basis to conclude that the post contains misinformation.
Text:
ian paisley says rape accused should have custody a los angeles gas leak leads to bombmaking charges for allegedly planning attack in virginia beach
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text and the image provided do not seem to be consistent with each other. The text mentions Ian Paisley and an individual in Los Angeles facing bombmaking charges related to a planned attack in Virginia Beach. However, the image shows a person wearing a graduation cap and an airplane in flight, which does not corroborate any part of the text. The image neither supports the claim about Ian Paisley nor the Los Angeles gas leak leading to bombmaking charges. Therefore, the inconsistency suggests that the post may contain misinformation.
Text:
patriothole a master strategist steve bannon has completed his yearlong plan to become increasingly irrelevant before eventually getting fired
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text appears to be satirical or sarcastic in nature, suggesting that Steve Bannon had a plan to become irrelevant and get fired, which is an unlikely strategy for any professional, especially a strategist. The image shows Steve Bannon with a logo that reads "PATRIOTHOLE," which could imply that the source is not a mainstream or reputable news outlet. The combination of the satirical text and the image with a potentially fictitious or satirical news source logo suggests that the post may contain misinformation or is not intended to be taken as factual news.
Text:
friendship games coinmedal given out to the supporting staff of the participating teams games were organized by the los angeles olympics boycotting nations and dubbed as alternativeolympics this medal belongs to my father in law who traveled with the indian team as its physician
Label: 0
Prediction:
The text claims that the medal was given out at the "Friendship Games," which were organized by the nations boycotting the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984, and that it was awarded to the supporting staff, including the father-in-law of the person who posted, who was a physician for the Indian team. However, the image shows a medal with Cyrillic text, which suggests that it is related to the Soviet Union or a Russian-speaking country. The "Friendship Games" were indeed organized by the Soviet Union and other countries that boycotted the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, but the text on the medal does not directly confirm its connection to the Indian team or the claim that it was awarded to the supporting staff such as a physician. Without further evidence to support the specific claim about the medal's recipient, there is a possibility of misinformation regarding the personal story attached to the medal. However, the existence of the "Friendship Games" and the fact that medals were awarded is accurate. The potential misinformation lies in the specific personal claim which cannot be verified with the provided evidence.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows an industrial setting, possibly a factory or a plant, which could be related to trade and manufacturing. The input text discusses the "aid for trade americas programme" and the need for more trade adjustment assistance, which could be relevant to industries like the one shown in the image. There is no clear inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. The image could be used to illustrate the type of industry that might be affected by trade policies and globalization, which is in line with the text's topic.
Text:
this is the salar de uyuni in southwest bolivia it stays dry for most of the year until it fills with a very thin layer of water which turns the worlds largest salt flat into the worlds largest mirror
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a reflection on a surface that appears to be very smooth and mirror-like, which is consistent with the description of Salar de Uyuni when it is covered with a thin layer of water. However, the presence of a complex, artistic structure in the middle of the image, which does not seem to be a natural part of the landscape, raises questions about the authenticity of the scene. This structure looks like a man-made object or artwork that is unlikely to be found in the middle of Salar de Uyuni. Therefore, the image may have been digitally altered or staged, which suggests that the post could contain misinformation regarding the natural state of Salar de Uyuni.
Text:

Prediction:
The image shows a hand holding a card that resembles a library checkout card, which is consistent with the description provided in the input text. The text mentions that the English faculty made library labels with the title of an imaginary book inspired by their studies as a form of congratulations card. The image complements this by showing what appears to be one of these cards. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
spuk im morgengrauen spook at dawn castigates the allied war crimes which became apparent after the devastating air raids on dresden as the perfidious cheshire cat from alice in wonderland churchill lurks on all ruins of a traumatic bombedout landscape
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a drawing of a devastated landscape with ruins and people in a state of distress, which is consistent with the description of a "traumatic bombed-out landscape" as mentioned in the text. However, the claim that Winston Churchill, depicted as the Cheshire Cat from "Alice in Wonderland," "lurks on all ruins" is a metaphorical and subjective interpretation rather than a factual statement. The image does not literally show Churchill as the Cheshire Cat, but rather uses artistic expression to convey a message. The text seems to be expressing an opinion or a metaphorical depiction rather than stating a verifiable fact. Therefore, while the image aligns with the general description of destruction, the anthropomorphic depiction of Churchill as a character from a fictional story is not a literal truth and could be considered misinformation if it is being presented as a factual account.

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a wrestling event with a person who appears to be Ric Flair walking towards the ring while a female wrestler, presumably his daughter, is standing in the foreground with a championship belt. The setting is consistent with a televised wrestling event, and the presence of the name "FLAIR" prominently displayed in the background supports the claim that this is related to Ric Flair and possibly his daughter. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text, which states that Ric Flair made a surprise television appearance to celebrate his daughter becoming champion in their hometown. Therefore, based on the information provided, there is no evidence of misinformation in this post.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction: The image appears to be a propaganda poster, likely from North Korea, showcasing various consumer goods such as food items, which aligns with the text's message about producing and supplying various consumer goods favored by the people in the light industry sector. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based solely on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a man who appears to be in a courtroom, smiling and interacting with another individual who could be a lawyer or legal representative. This scene is consistent with the input text, which describes a man becoming a free man after his conviction was vacated. The courtroom setting and the man's demeanor, which suggests relief or happiness, align with the narrative of someone being released from prison. There is no evident inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided does not support the text. The image is a logo of a speech bubble, which does not correlate with the story of a man using a horse to bring books to children. There is no visual evidence of a mobile library, a horse named Luna, or any activity related to the story described. Therefore, the image does not complement or provide evidence for the text, suggesting that this post may contain misinformation.
Text:
four young twin cities men facing federal terrorism charges have been chosen for a firstofits kind deradicalization program under the supervision of a minneapolis judge and a german expert on islamic extremism
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided is the logo of the Star Tribune, which is a legitimate news organization based in Minneapolis. The text mentions a specific case in the Twin Cities (Minneapolis-Saint Paul area) and refers to a deradicalization program involving a Minneapolis judge and a German expert. There is no inherent inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. The logo alone does not provide specific evidence for or against the text, but it does not contradict it either. Without further context or evidence that the text is false, we cannot conclude that there is misinformation present based solely on the image of the news organization's logo.
Text:
stanford sexual assault survivor reveals identity she was known as emily doe when her victim impact statement read out in the sexual assault trial of brock turner went viral
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a woman standing in front of a wall with drawings, and the logo of BBC News is visible, suggesting that this is a news-related image. However, without additional context or verification, it is not possible to confirm whether the woman in the image is indeed the person referred to in the text as the "Stanford sexual assault survivor." The image alone does not provide sufficient evidence to verify the identity of the individual or the claims made in the text. Therefore, based on the image alone, we cannot determine the accuracy of the text, and caution should be exercised before drawing conclusions about misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows an accessible bathroom, but the features described in the text do not fully match what is visible in the image. The mirror is not angled for wheelchair users, and the emergency pull cord does not line the bottom of the walls. Instead, the emergency cord is seen hanging next to the toilet, which is a common placement but does not match the description of lining the bottom of the walls.

Prediction: The text and the image appear to be consistent with each other. The image shows a poster with the phrase "NO intervención" which translates to "NO intervention" in English, aligning with the message in the input text. The poster also includes additional text in Spanish that echoes the sentiment of wanting to be free, sovereign, and independent, which is in line with the input text's message about a desire for peace, bread, and dignity without US involvement in Nicaragua. There is no clear indication of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not appear to be an engraving from the time period when Pocahontas was alive, nor does it resemble the style of Simon van de Passe, a known engraver from the early 17th century. Instead, the image shows a modern photograph of a woman dressed in a style that does not correspond with the attire from the era of Pocahontas. This inconsistency suggests that the image is not the life portrait of Pocahontas engraved by Simon van de Passe, and therefore, the post contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text describes a British colour lithograph poster designed by H.A. Rothholz, which uses the imagery of a hand impaled by a flagpole with a flag to equate Nazi Germany with germs, conveying the message that wounds should be treated promptly to prevent infection and metaphorically not to aid the enemy. The image provided is consistent with the description in the text. It shows a poster with a hand, a flagpole with a flag that has the word "Germs" and a swastika, and the text "Germs invade - Get first aid and don't help the enemy." The visual and textual content align, suggesting that there is no misinformation between the image and the input text.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows two unrelated items: on the left, there is a set of printer ink cartridges, which could be related to the cartridge refilling business mentioned in the text. On the right, there are blue pills with "Pfizer" on them, which are unrelated to the text about a cartridge refilling business and a legal case with Lexmark. The presence of the pills creates inconsistency with the text and suggests that the image is not providing accurate evidence for the text, leading to the conclusion that this post contains misinformation.
Text:
my dad front in vietnam in didnt know this photo existed until i came across it randomly on the internet he cried when he saw it hope this is the right place to post it
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a collection of painted figurines, which appear to be miniature soldiers or action figures, set against a backdrop of colorful bottles, likely paint bottles given the context. These figurines do not represent an authentic photograph of a person or a historical event. The text claims that the individual's father fought in Vietnam and that the photo was discovered online, which led to an emotional reaction from the father. However, the image provided does not depict a real person or a scene from the Vietnam War, but rather toys or collectibles. This inconsistency suggests that the post contains misinformation, as the image does not support the claim made in the text.
Text:
when your german grandma is watching all my hard work and asks me what do you mind if i want for my opinion about nickelodeons version of heaven and its
Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text appears to be nonsensical or incomplete, and it does not provide any clear information that could be verified against the image. The text mentions a German grandmother, hard work, and a request for an opinion about "Nickelodeon's version of heaven," which is a vague and unclear statement that does not seem to relate to any factual content or visual evidence.
The image provided is a GIF of Samuel L. Jackson in a scene from a movie, with the caption "Tick-tock, motherfucker!" This image does not correlate with the text in any discernible way, and it certainly does not provide any evidence or context that would allow for the verification of the text's claims about a grandmother or Nickelodeon's version of heaven.
Given the lack of coherence and the absence of any meaningful connection between the text and the image, it is not possible to fact-check the statement. However, the nonsensical nature of the text and the unrelated image suggest that the post may contain misinformation or be intended as a joke or meme rather than a serious statement.

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows two individuals wearing t-shirts with the inscription "Principle 6," which is likely a reference to the Olympic Charter's Principle 6 that opposes any form of discrimination. This aligns with the input text stating that American Apparel has partnered with organizations to benefit LGBT advocacy groups in Russia, suggesting a campaign related to the Sochi Winter Olympics. The image supports the text, and there is no evident inconsistency that would suggest misinformation.

The text is incoherent and contains elements that are not logically connected, making it difficult to understand the intended message. It mentions a cat going through a depression episode, reviving an old man, and something about the late Linkin Park vocalist, which are unrelated concepts. The image shows a group of cats cuddling together, which does not provide any evidence or context that would relate to the text, especially regarding the revival of a person or the mention of the Linkin Park vocalist. The inconsistency and lack of clarity in the text, combined with an unrelated image, suggest that the post contains misinformation or is nonsensical.

mike rowe honors a toy maker in west jordan ut alton thacker has made and donated more than wooden cars to children in his free time over the last years
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows two individuals, one of whom is holding a wooden car toy. This visual evidence supports the text's claim that Alton Thacker, presumably the man in the image, makes and donates wooden cars. There is no clear discrepancy between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. However, without additional context or verification of the individuals' identities and the story, a definitive conclusion cannot be made. The assessment is based solely on the consistency between the text and the image provided.
Text:
my fiance took two photos while i was driving and google stitched them together into a panoramic shot without me even asking it to i didnt know this feature existed but i thought it was pretty cool
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided appears to be a panoramic shot that could have been automatically stitched together by a smartphone or software, which is consistent with the claim made in the input text. Google Photos and other smartphone applications have features that can automatically create panoramic images from multiple photos, even without direct user input. The image shows signs of being stitched together, as indicated by the slight distortions and seams that are typical of panoramic images created by such features. Therefore, there is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.

this dwight d eisenhower coin made in was passed down from my great aunt to my great grandfather and to my dad in and now to me in they were only made for years
Label: 0
Prediction:
The text claims that the Dwight D. Eisenhower coin was passed down from the great aunt to the great grandfather, then to the father, and now to the person in 2023, and that these coins were only made for two years. However, the image shows a note that states the Eisenhower dollars were minted from 1971 to 1978, which is a seven-year span, not two years as claimed in the text. This discrepancy between the text and the information provided in the image suggests that there is misinformation in the post.
Text:
tfw youre averaging a triple double but your best player left no free agent would ever sign with your team and youre looking at five straight years of first round exits
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text appears to be a subjective statement expressing frustration about a basketball player's situation, likely referring to their performance and team dynamics. The image shows a basketball player in action during a game, wearing a jersey with the number 0, which could be indicative of the player mentioned in the text. The image itself does not provide any factual information that could be verified as true or false, and it does not directly contradict the text. Therefore, there is no clear evidence of misinformation based solely on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
driving with a suspended license for a dui is never a good idea especially when approaching a dui checkpoint while drunk drinking a beer and putting on your sunglasses
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided is a logo of HuffPost, a well-known news website. The image does not provide any evidence or context that would confirm or contradict the text. The text describes a specific scenario involving illegal behavior, but the image does not complement or provide evidence for the text. Therefore, there is no way to determine from the image if the text is accurate or if it contains misinformation. However, the lack of relevant visual information to support the text suggests that this could be a post containing misinformation, as it does not verify the claim made in the text.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a healthcare setting with a person wearing gloves, apparently drawing blood from another person's arm, which is consistent with medical procedures related to HIV treatment or testing. The presence of the BBC News logo suggests that the image is from a reputable news source, which lends credibility to the claim. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text provided. Therefore, based on the information given, there is no clear evidence of misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a street-side book stall with a sign indicating that the books are free to take, which is consistent with the text's description of a man in Manila putting his books on the street for people to borrow for free. There is no evident inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text mentions "team indus a small russian production company stratosfera with no verification and no one under has experienced a day that shook the world video," which is a confusing and seemingly inaccurate statement. Team Indus is an Indian aerospace startup, not a Russian production company. The mention of "stratosfera" is unclear, as it could refer to a different entity, but there is no clear connection to Team Indus. Additionally, the phrase "no one under has experienced a day that shook the world video" is unclear and does not provide a coherent message.
The image shows what appears to be a rocket or missile in flight, possibly related to space exploration or military activity. There is no direct contradiction between the image and the text, but the text itself contains inaccuracies and is not clearly related to the image. The lack of clarity and verification in the text, combined with the unrelated image, suggests that the post may contain misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The text states that the Tomb of Humayun in Delhi started the tradition of Mughal emperors being buried in paradise gardens, and that this tradition reached its zenith with the Taj Mahal. The image provided shows a structure that is consistent with the architectural style of Mughal monuments, which often include gardens and are known for their grandeur and historical significance. There is no clear inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. The Tomb of Humayun is indeed a significant Mughal structure in Delhi with garden settings, and it is a UNESCO World Heritage site known for its architectural importance and influence on later Mughal architecture, including the Taj Mahal.
Text:
do you want this to happen to your women and children protect them from the bolsheviks poland by the german artist willibald krain to help the poles in their fight against the red army
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image is a propaganda poster that depicts a caricatured figure with a menacing expression, holding a woman against her will, with a child on the ground, which aligns with the fear-inducing message of the text. The figure is marked with the Bolshevik symbol, which is consistent with the text's warning against the Bolsheviks. The text mentions the artist Willibald Krain, who was known for creating such propaganda artwork. Given the historical context and the nature of propaganda, the poster is likely to exaggerate or distort facts to provoke a strong emotional response and may not accurately represent the actual events or intentions of the Bolsheviks. Therefore, the post could contain misinformation by using propagandistic imagery to instill fear and bias against a particular group.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image does not show a scene that matches the description given in the input text. There is no Dr Pepper can, snow, margaritas, hands, or a critter that resembles a person throwing a bowling ball. Instead, the image shows a downspout near some vegetation with a small bird on the ground. There is a clear inconsistency between the text and the image, indicating that the post contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a Palm Pre smartphone displaying a picture of what appears to be an older PDA device, which is consistent with the description provided in the input text. The text mentions three generations of technology: a Handspring PDA, a Palm Pre, and an iPhone X. The image complements the text by showing two of these devices, with the Palm Pre displaying a picture of the Handspring PDA. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
a us navy enlisted man stops to read a welcome sign an hour after the initial wave of the th us army corps troops was landed at jinsen korea by vice admiral de barbeys seventh amphibious force
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a US Navy enlisted man reading a welcome sign, which is consistent with the input text. The sign reads "We Korean race welcome this American 8th Army Troops." This aligns with the text's mention of a welcome sign and the presence of US military personnel, presumably after a landing operation in Korea. The text refers to the "7th Amphibious Force" and the "th US Army Corps," which could be a typographical error missing the numeral for the Army Corps, but this does not necessarily indicate misinformation regarding the overall context of the image and the text. Therefore, there is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the provided text and image.
Text:
patriothole cruelty of the left why is the msm attacking president trump for being close with putin even though its really hard for adult men to make new friends
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text and the image appear to be satirical in nature, as indicated by the source "patriothole" which is a play on the satirical website "The Onion." The text mocks the media's criticism of a political figure's relationship with another world leader by trivializing it as a difficulty in adult men making new friends. The image shows the two leaders shaking hands, which is a common diplomatic gesture and does not provide any substantial evidence regarding the nature of their relationship. The combination of the satirical source and the trivializing text suggests that the post is intended as humor rather than factual reporting, thus containing misinformation if interpreted as serious news.
Text:
saw some people online painting pokemon on the use of children as symbols in the past is only decided when they are observed and measured in the yard this weekend with tons of birds at the end of their wings on the fast break
Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text is nonsensical and does not form a coherent statement. It appears to be a random collection of words and phrases related to Pokémon, children, birds, and sports, which has no clear connection to the image provided.
The image is a satirical take on the argument that PC gaming is too expensive by comparing it to other exaggeratedly expensive activities. The image is structured to mock the idea that PC gaming is prohibitively costly by listing absurdly high prices for everyday activities, such as driving a car or eating food, and then concludes by stating that PC gaming is cheaper than console gaming.
Since the text and the image are completely unrelated, there is a clear inconsistency between them. The text does not support or provide evidence for the content of the image, nor does the image illustrate or complement the text. Therefore, this post contains misinformation due to the lack of coherence and relevance between the text and the image.
Text:
life heartbreaking this guy is beating himself up for making a dumb comment in a meeting even though his coworkers ignore him whenever he talks
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a group of people in a meeting, with one man appearing distressed while others seem to be engaged in a discussion. This visual does not necessarily indicate that the man is "beating himself up" for making a dumb comment, nor does it provide evidence that his coworkers ignore him whenever he talks. The image alone cannot confirm the specific internal feelings or the exact dynamics of the interaction described in the text. Therefore, the image does not substantiate the claim made in the text, which could lead to misinformation if the text's context is taken as fact based solely on the image.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image has been digitally manipulated to create a recursive effect where the image of the two men is repeated within itself multiple times. The original context of the image likely shows Chris Hemsworth and his stunt double, but the recursive editing does not accurately represent reality and creates a misleading impression. The text is also nonsensical and repetitive, which does not correspond to the manipulated image in a meaningful way. Therefore, this post contains misinformation due to the altered image and the nonsensical text.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a police vehicle outside a building, which could be a courthouse or a police station. This is consistent with the context of the input text, which discusses a legal matter involving a drug dealer who has turned himself in. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided. The image complements the text by providing a setting that is plausible for the narrative described.
Text:

Prediction:
The image provided is consistent with the input text. It appears to be a historical or reproduction of a political stickerette or silent agitator from the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), which was known for its radical labor organizing methods in the early 20th century. The text on the image matches the input text verbatim, and the style of the image is reminiscent of the graphic design from the era when the IWW was most active. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.

Label: 0
Prediction: The image supports the text by showing what appears to be a young girl standing next to a large amount of pet food, which aligns with the claim that she asked for pet food donations for her birthday. The left side of the image also shows several people unloading pet food from a vehicle, which suggests that a significant amount of donations were collected, consistent with the "more than pounds of dog and cat food" mentioned in the text. There is no evident inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a man, presumably Marc Koska, engaging with a local community, and the presence of The Guardian's logo suggests that this is a news story covered by the reputable news outlet. The text describes Marc Koska's campaign against the use of dirty needles and mentions the WHO's global campaign, which aligns with the kind of public health initiative that would be reported by a news organization. There is no immediate discrepancy between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a person standing on a large pile of waste, which could be indicative of a recycling facility or a waste management site. The presence of the logo "The Guardian," a reputable news organization, suggests that the image is likely from a news report related to waste management or recycling. Although the image alone does not confirm Wales' ranking in recycling, it does not contradict the claim made in the input text. Without further evidence to the contrary, there is no clear indication of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows the logo of the Associated Press (AP), a reputable news organization known for its journalistic standards. The presence of the AP logo suggests that the accompanying text may have originated from a news article or report distributed by the Associated Press. However, without additional context or the ability to verify the current policies regarding Palestinians from the Gaza Strip visiting Jerusalem's mosques, it is not possible to definitively determine the accuracy of the text based solely on the logo. The logo itself does not provide evidence to support or contradict the text, and thus, there is no clear indication of misinformation from the image alone.
Text:

Prediction:
The image shows a building under construction with a modern design that could be indicative of sustainable architecture practices. This aligns with the input text, which states that Greensburg, Kansas, opted for a more sustainable future after being destroyed by a tornado. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Prediction:
The image provided is a logo of KUTV, which is a legitimate news station based in Salt Lake City, Utah. However, without additional context or the ability to verify the specific news story, the image alone does not confirm or contradict the text provided. The text describes an event that could be newsworthy and does not contain any overt signs of misinformation. Therefore, based on the image and the text provided, there is no clear evidence of misinformation.
Text:
one mans journey to mexico for heroin addiction treatment using ibogaine its not just that it gets you off the heroin its like it hits the reset button
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a person who appears to be lying down, possibly in a state of rest or under the influence of a substance, but it does not provide any verifiable information regarding the use of ibogaine for heroin addiction treatment or its effects. The claim made in the text about ibogaine's ability to "hit the reset button" on heroin addiction is a strong one and would require more substantial evidence to be considered accurate. Without additional context or evidence to support the text, the image alone does not confirm the claim, and thus, the post could potentially contain misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image appears to be a poster that celebrates the 45th anniversary of the New People's Army (NPA), which is consistent with the input text stating that it is a poster made by Brazilian students honoring the New People's Army. The text on the poster is in Portuguese and translates to "Long live the new army of the people! 45 years of victories for the Filipino people!" which aligns with the description provided in the input text. There is no direct evidence in the image that contradicts the text, so there is no indication of misinformation based on the image and text provided.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows two individuals holding a banner for "Tommy's," which is consistent with the text mentioning a charity called Tommy's. The banner also includes the phrase "Saving babies' lives," which aligns with the charity's mission related to research into premature birth, stillbirth, and miscarriage as described in the text. There is no evident inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a person in a hospital bed with bandages on his arms, which could be consistent with someone who has undergone surgery. However, the individual does not appear to be a quadruple amputee as the text claims. The visible presence of both of his arms contradicts the statement that the individual is a quadruple amputee. Therefore, there is a discrepancy between the text and the image, suggesting that misinformation may be present.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a young man in graduation attire embracing a police officer, which is consistent with the input text stating that Officer Eric Ellison attended Kazzie Porties' graduation after delivering tragic news to him. The inset picture of a man wearing a hat with the American flag could be interpreted as a representation of the teen's late parent, adding emotional context to the story. There is no evident inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation.
Text:

Prediction:
The text describes a scenario where someone allegedly walked into a Starbucks and repeatedly screamed "capitalism" at a barista until the police were called. The image shows a calm Starbucks setting with no signs of disturbance, police presence, or any individual engaging in the behavior described in the text. The image does not corroborate the story told in the text, suggesting that the text may contain misinformation or be a fictional or exaggerated account.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows two men in front of a background that includes the text "Wahl 16," which suggests a connection to an election event in a German-speaking country, likely Austria given the context. The logo in the corner appears to be that of BBC News, which is a reputable news organization. However, without the ability to verify the current events or the authenticity of the image, I cannot confirm the accuracy of the claim made in the input text. The presence of the BBC logo does not guarantee the image's authenticity or relevance to the text, as images can be manipulated or taken out of context. Therefore, based on the information provided, there is a possibility of misinformation due to the lack of verifiable details connecting the image to the text.
Text:
kurdish fighters fly ft flag of victory on hill over kobane as isis supply route is finally cut after four months of bloody siege in syrias stalingrad
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided does not show a "ft flag of victory" being flown by Kurdish fighters over Kobane. Instead, it shows a tall structure with a long, colorful ribbon-like object attached to it, which does not resemble a traditional flag. Additionally, the context of the image does not seem to match the description of a "bloody siege" or a victory scene. The image also includes an inset of an explosion, which does not provide clear evidence of a victory or the cutting of a supply route. Therefore, the image and the text appear to be inconsistent, suggesting that the post may contain misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a certificate that appears to be from a police career, which is consistent with the text mentioning something from the submitter's grandfather's police career. Additionally, there is an old Bank of England one pound note behind the certificate, which could be the "old ps note" referred to in the text. The name on the certificate is not visible, which aligns with the statement that the name is censored for privacy. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

The image shows a view of a sunset from the back window of a truck, with different colors visible in the side window and the back window, which is consistent with the description provided in the input text. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
goodyear ad for a rocket assisted atomic depth charge subroc neednt make a direct hit to be effective found in a comic book the ad also throws in some bike tires at the end
Label: 1
Prediction: The image shows a comic book page with an advertisement for Goodyear Aerospace, which includes illustrations of a rocket being launched from a submarine, a depiction of an explosion underwater, and a character named "Flash Farrell" observing various aerospace and defense technologies. The text at the bottom of the comic advertises Goodyear tires, suggesting that the company is promoting both their aerospace technology and consumer products like tires. The mention of a "rocket assisted atomic depth charge subroc" aligns with the imagery of the rocket being launched from the submarine, which suggests that the advertisement is indeed for a weapon system known as SUBROC (Submarine Rocket), a Cold War-era weapon. The inclusion of bike tires at the end of the ad is also consistent with the bottom panel of the comic, which shows Goodyear tires. Therefore, the text description seems to accurately reflect the content of the image, and there is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the provided text and image. However, the claim that the SUBROC "needn't make a direct hit to be effective" could be misleading without proper context, as it implies a level of effectiveness that may not be accurate without additional information about the weapon's capabilities. This could potentially be seen as misinformation depending on the intent and context in which the statement is made.

The image shows a couple standing in front of a house with flowers and hanging baskets, which is consistent with the text describing a newlywed couple who decorated their local area with flowers instead of going on an expensive honeymoon. The presence of the BBC News logo suggests that the image is from a reputable news source, which lends credibility to the story. There is no evident inconsistency or reason to suspect misinformation based on the information provided in the text and the image.
Text:
heartbreaking dad is excited out of his fucking mind after asking a cab driver in aruba to take us where the locals eat and getting dropped off at whats basically an olive garden
Label: 1
Prediction: The image shows a man standing in front of a building that appears to be in a tropical location, which could be consistent with Aruba. There is no clear evidence in the image to suggest that the text is misinformation. The text is a personal anecdote about a father's experience, and the image does not provide any verifiable information that contradicts the text. The mention of "Olive Garden" is likely metaphorical, indicating a generic or chain restaurant rather than a specific location. Therefore, there is no basis to claim misinformation solely from the image and the text provided.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text and the image do not correspond with each other. The text talks about a "potential new immune-based therapy to treat precancers in the European Commission," which seems to be a health-related topic. However, the image shows the interior of a restaurant with a humorous sign that says, "It's okay to eat a whole pizza by yourself," and a caption that reads, "The restaurant understands me." There is no connection between a new immune-based therapy and the content of the image, which suggests that the post contains misinformation due to the inconsistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a plant that has grown through a shrub and is reaching toward the roof line of a house. However, the plant in question does not appear to be a dandelion. Dandelions (Taraxacum officinale) are commonly known as small flowering plants with yellow flowers and do not grow to the size of the plant depicted in the image. The plant shown is much larger and does not exhibit the typical characteristics of a dandelion, such as the distinctive yellow flower head or the rosette of leaves at the base. Therefore, the text contains misinformation regarding the identification of the plant as a dandelion.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text refers to a "recent post with captain tiny arm and baby mega hand," which suggests a humorous or satirical content. The image provided is a drawing that matches the description given in the text, depicting a character labeled "Captain Tiny Arm" and another smaller character labeled "Baby Mega Hand." The image appears to be a playful illustration rather than a depiction of real-life entities or events. There is no claim of fact that can be fact-checked against the image, and the content seems to be intentionally fictional and for entertainment. Therefore, there is no misinformation present based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided is simply the ESPN logo, which does not confirm or refute the text's claim about a specific event involving the Kansas Jayhawks and senior manager Chris Huey. The image does not complement or provide evidence for the text, as it does not depict the individual mentioned or any related event. Therefore, based on the provided image, we cannot verify the information in the text, which could indicate the presence of misinformation due to the lack of relevant visual evidence. However, it's important to note that the absence of confirming evidence in the image does not necessarily mean the text itself is false—it just means that the image does not support the text.
Text:
the former island paradise of bikini atoll is slowing blooming back to life years after the united states dropped nuclear bombs on it including a device in that was times larger than the hiroshima atom bomb
Label: 0
Prediction:
The text states that the Bikini Atoll is recovering years after nuclear tests were conducted by the United States, and the image shows a lush and seemingly healthy beach environment, which could be indicative of recovery and regrowth. The image also includes a watermark from "The Guardian," suggesting that it is from a reputable news source and the date "from 2017" indicates that the image is relatively recent. There is no direct evidence in the image to contradict the claim made in the text, and the image could be seen as supporting the text's statement about the island's recovery. Therefore, based on the information provided, there is no clear indication of misinformation.
Text:

Prediction:
The image provided does not match the description given in the input text. The text describes an urban scene with concrete roads and a ferry moving down a canal, while the image shows a view of the sky through a canopy of trees, with no urban elements, roads, or a ferry visible. Therefore, there is a discrepancy between the text and the image, indicating misinformation.
Text:
i came back mom the withdrawal of troops from afghanistan completed poster from the last days of the soviet union depicting a body bag on a tank x
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a poster with Cyrillic text, which suggests it is of Soviet origin. The poster depicts a body bag on a tank, which is consistent with the description in the input text. However, the text mentions "the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan completed," which could imply a recent event, whereas the poster is described as being from "the last days of the Soviet Union." The Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, and its withdrawal from Afghanistan was completed in 1989, which is not a recent event. Therefore, the text seems to be misleading by suggesting a connection between a historical poster and a recent withdrawal of troops, which likely refers to the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. This anachronism indicates the presence of misinformation.
Text:
student protests the right to fright an obsession with safe spaces is not just bad for education it also diminishes worthwhile campus protests
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image depicts a cartoon of a person inside a room labeled "SAFE SPACE" looking out anxiously, with a broken sign that reads "Freedom of speech" on the floor, suggesting that the concept of safe spaces is in opposition to freedom of speech. The input text criticizes the obsession with safe spaces and suggests that it is detrimental to education and diminishes the value of campus protests. The image complements the text by illustrating the perceived conflict between safe spaces and freedom of speech, which is a common argument in debates about campus culture. However, the assertion that safe spaces inherently diminish worthwhile campus protests or are bad for education is a matter of opinion and not a factual statement that can be objectively classified as misinformation. The image and text together express an opinion or viewpoint rather than presenting verifiable facts that could be true or false. Therefore, while the post may be controversial or debatable, it does not contain misinformation based on the provided content and image.

The image does not provide any clear evidence that supports the text's claim about a young girl interviewing an Olympian, which led to a gold medal win and shaped her career at the New York Times. The image shows three adults standing together, one of whom is holding a piece of paper with text on it. There is no indication that any of the individuals are Olympians or journalists for the New York Times, nor is there a young girl present or any context suggesting an interview that influenced an Olympic win. The lack of relevant visual information to support the text's narrative suggests that there may be misinformation present.

the way this mcdonalds wrap fits into my cupholder so i can get fat and have another heart attack while driving in a distracted manner because im eating
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a McDonald's wrap in a car's cupholder, which is consistent with the text's description. The text is a subjective statement expressing the individual's opinion about the convenience of the food packaging fitting into a cupholder, and their personal commentary on eating while driving. There is no direct misinformation present as the image corroborates the text's claim about the packaging fitting into the cupholder. The text's mention of "getting fat" and "having another heart attack" is hyperbolic and reflects the individual's personal commentary on the health implications of eating fast food, rather than a factual claim.
Text:
four years ago a year old man cared for and nursed a beached penguin back to health and now the bird consistently travels miles every few months to revisit his caregiver
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a man squatting down to interact with a penguin, which supports the narrative provided in the input text. The text claims that a man cared for a penguin, and the penguin returns to visit him. The image is consistent with this story, showing a friendly interaction between a man and a penguin, which suggests that there is a bond between them. There is no evidence in the image that contradicts the text, and the scenario described is plausible and has been reported in various news stories. Therefore, there is no indication of misinformation based on the image and text provided.
Text:
you see meo if you take the blue pill the story ends you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe you take the red pill you stay in wonderland and i show you how deep the rabbit hole goes
Label: 1
Prediction: The text is a reference to a famous dialogue from the movie "The Matrix," where the character Morpheus offers Neo a choice between a red pill and a blue pill, with each pill having different consequences. The image, however, has been digitally altered to show a cat with sunglasses that reflect the image of Morpheus, and the cat is holding a red and a blue pill. The image is meant to be a humorous take on the scene from the movie, but it does not provide evidence or context that is consistent with the text in terms of being a factual report. Therefore, the post is likely to contain misinformation as the image is not an authentic representation of the text's content.
Text:
for a brief period boston legalized humanskeleton marriage however the law was repealed when most of the skeleton grooms turned out to be jazz musicians
Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text claims that Boston legalized human-skeleton marriage for a brief period, which was repealed because the skeleton grooms were jazz musicians. This statement is absurd and factually incorrect, as marriage laws do not recognize marriages between humans and non-living entities such as skeletons. The image provided appears to be an old, possibly altered or staged photograph showing a human figure standing next to a skeleton holding a brass instrument, with a cat on a pedestal. The image seems to be an attempt at humor or art rather than evidence of an actual event or legal situation. Therefore, the post contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided is an edited picture that features Squidward, a fictional character from the animated television series "SpongeBob SquarePants," superimposed onto a background that appears to be a scene from the Vietnam War. Given that Squidward is a well-known animated character and not a real person, the claim that the image is of someone's father who served in Vietnam is false. Therefore, the post contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a computer screen displaying what appears to be a social media platform, not a hospital TV interface that would provide the functionalities described in the input text. There is no evidence of a concierge service, robot delivery, doctor chat, medical results, or movies being displayed on the screen. Therefore, the image does not support the claims made in the text, suggesting the presence of misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a news report about a 10-year-old setting up a lemonade stand to help her family, which is consistent with the input text describing a little girl starting a lemonade stand to raise money to rebuild her home after a fire and contractors took the money. The text and the image complement each other, and there is no immediate evidence of misinformation based on the information provided.
Text:
i found this globe that still had russia as the soviet union and many of the countries that are now independent are still part of it also sudan is still whole here
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a globe with the label "Union of Soviet Socialist Republics," which corresponds to the description in the input text stating that the globe still had Russia as the Soviet Union. This suggests that the globe is outdated, as the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. The text also mentions that many countries that are now independent are still part of it, which is consistent with the presence of the USSR label, as it comprised multiple republics that later became independent countries. Additionally, the text mentions that Sudan is still whole, which, although not visible in the provided image, is plausible given the outdated political boundaries shown. Therefore, there is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows an elderly woman, presumably the shop owner, with a smile on her face and what appears to be handmade supportive messages, possibly from the community. This visual evidence is consistent with the input text, which mentions the community showering her with love and support after the incident. There is no clear indication of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a beautiful landscape that could be in Canada, and it has the logo of "The Guardian," which is a reputable news organization. The text talks about a Canadian man offering to share his land with First Nations and mentions his reaction to negative sentiments towards indigenous people. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text, and the presence of The Guardian's logo could suggest that the story was reported by a credible source. Without further evidence to the contrary, there is no clear indication of misinformation based on the image and text provided.
Text:
it teaches to eat only when your body contains more bacterial cells than human cells in filtered seawater that drifts in and around the carpathian mountains and west of the monsters cinematic universe which is the stepfather of actor matthew perry
Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text contains a nonsensical statement that combines unrelated elements in a way that does not make logical sense. It mentions eating based on the number of bacterial cells in the body compared to human cells, which is a concept not supported by scientific understanding or nutritional advice. Additionally, it references filtered seawater in the Carpathian Mountains, which are a mountain range in Central and Eastern Europe and have no connection to seawater. The text also incorrectly connects the "monsters cinematic universe" and actor Matthew Perry in a familial context, which is factually incorrect and irrelevant to the topic of nutrition or health.
The image provided shows a pattern of green bottles and does not complement or provide evidence for the text. There is no clear connection between the image and the text, and the image does not validate any of the claims made in the text.
Therefore, the post is likely to contain misinformation due to the nonsensical and factually incorrect statements in the text, and the image does not support or refute the text in any meaningful way.
Text:
is baltimores prosecutor wrong about freddie grays legal knife the weapon police described is definitely illegalso why did marilyn mosby say it wasnt the answer hinges on a single spring
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image and the text do not seem to be directly related. The text discusses the legality of a knife in the context of Freddie Gray's case and Baltimore's prosecutor Marilyn Mosby's statement about it. The image, on the other hand, shows a protest sign with the text "JUSTICE FOR FREDDIE" and a background of multiple images of presumably the same person, which is likely Freddie Gray. The image appears to be from a protest or public demonstration demanding justice for Freddie Gray, which is a separate issue from the legal details of the knife in question. The inconsistency between the text and the image suggests that the post may contain misinformation, as the image does not provide evidence or context for the claim made in the text about the legality of the knife.
Text:
the trump administration has no plan for reuniting the immigrant families it is tearing apart no procedure to keep track of which children have been taken from which parents
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a child being held by an adult, which could be indicative of a family or caregiver relationship, but it does not provide any verifiable information about the Trump administration's policies or procedures regarding the reunification of immigrant families. Therefore, the image does not confirm or refute the claim made in the input text. Without additional context or evidence, we cannot determine the accuracy of the statement, and the image does not serve as evidence to support the text. Thus, the post could potentially contain misinformation due to the lack of corroborating evidence in the image.
Text:

Prediction:
The input text is incoherent and does not form a logical sentence or question. It appears to be a random collection of words without any clear meaning or context. The image shows a person standing at a podium, which seems to be unrelated to the text provided. The lack of coherence and context between the text and the image suggests that the post may contain misinformation, as there is no clear connection or evidence provided by the image to support the text.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided is of a barred window set in a brick wall, which does not correlate with the text describing Bill Clinton giving a speech while resting his face on his phone in a studio apartment. There is no visual evidence of Bill Clinton, a speech, a studio apartment, or any related activity in the image. The inconsistency between the text and the image suggests that the post may contain misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows "I Voted" stickers, which are commonly associated with elections and voting processes. The text talks about an election for a volunteer job of managing a polling station, and there is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the information provided in the text. Without additional context that suggests otherwise, there is no clear indication of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
awesome tgi fridays has announced they will be offering a sip of beer on their kids menu as long as children swear they wont tell their folks
Label: 1
Prediction: The claim that TGI Fridays is offering a sip of beer on their kids' menu if children swear they won't tell their parents is highly implausible and would be illegal in many jurisdictions, as serving alcohol to minors is against the law. The image shows a child in a restaurant setting, which does not provide any legitimate evidence to support such a claim. Therefore, this post likely contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows commercial airplanes at an airport, which is consistent with the text mentioning smuggling foreigners into the US on commercial flights to Newark. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the information provided in the text. The image of the airport and airplanes could be used as a general representation of the smuggling method described. However, without additional context or evidence, it is not possible to definitively determine the veracity of the text solely based on the image. The image does not provide specific evidence of the smuggling operation or the individual's guilt, but it also does not present any clear misinformation. Therefore, based on the image alone, there is no indication of misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows two individuals who appear to be politicians, which is consistent with the context of a political primary election mentioned in the input text. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based solely on the image and the text provided. The text states that JB Pritzker was declared the Democratic nominee for governor of Illinois by the Associated Press, and the image does not contradict this statement. Without additional context or evidence, there is no basis to conclude that the post contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The text describes a caterpillar transforming into a pupa, which is a normal stage in the life cycle of a butterfly or moth. The image shows a chrysalis, which is consistent with the description of a caterpillar becoming a pupa. The colors and shape are different from that of a caterpillar, as mentioned in the text. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text and the image provided do not seem to be consistent with each other. The text appears to be a fragmented statement about someone experiencing issues with their computer, specifically mentioning problems with Windows reinstallation and RAM usage. However, the image shows a DNS test result page, which is related to network and internet connectivity issues, not directly to operating system reinstallation or RAM usage problems. The lack of coherence between the text and the image suggests that the post may contain misinformation or is at least mismatched, which could lead to confusion or misinterpretation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided is a still from the Star Wars film series, showing a holographic projection of a character from the franchise with the caption "What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?" This image is not related to historical events such as the German invasion of Belgium during World War I or debates in the British parliament about joining the war. The inconsistency between the historical context of the input text and the fictional content of the image indicates that the post contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a group of individuals wearing yellow shirts, which could indicate they are part of a volunteer group, observing what appears to be a ceremonial event. In the foreground, there are individuals in military uniforms, which is consistent with the Changing of the Guard ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. The presence of veterans and volunteers in the image aligns with the text's claim that WWII and Korean War veterans are watching the ceremony and that there are volunteers present. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text is incoherent and does not form a logical sentence or statement. It appears to be a random collection of phrases that do not relate to each other in a meaningful way. The image shows a spectrum of light on a carpet, which is likely caused by light refraction, possibly from a prism or a glass object. There is no clear connection between the text and the image, and the text itself does not convey a coherent message that could be supported or contradicted by the image. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if there is misinformation based on the provided content. However, given the nonsensical nature of the text, it is likely that the post is not intended to convey factual information, hence the prediction of misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided is the official seal of the United States Department of Justice. While the seal itself does not directly confirm or refute the information provided in the text, the use of an official government seal in conjunction with a specific claim about a criminal case could be an attempt to lend credibility to the statement. However, without additional context or evidence, the image alone does not verify the claims made in the text. Therefore, the presence of misinformation cannot be determined solely based on the image and the text provided. It is important to cross-reference the claims with official Department of Justice releases or other credible sources to assess the accuracy of the information.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a person with a white, billowing material that could be interpreted as a visual metaphor for lightweight or biodegradable materials, such as the bioplastic mentioned in the text. While the image does not directly confirm the specifics of the bioplastic being made from mango and seaweed, nor does it feature the scientist or the bioplastic itself, there is also no clear evidence of misinformation based solely on the image and text provided. The image could be used in a conceptual manner to represent the idea of eco-friendly materials, which aligns with the text's message about a sustainable plastic alternative. Therefore, without further context or evidence, we cannot conclude that there is misinformation present.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text is incoherent and contains a jumble of phrases that do not form a logical or factual statement. It mentions "man vs machine," "president trumps mother," "fight nazis," and "obstructionist loser democrats," which are disjointed and do not provide a clear context or claim that can be verified or supported by the image.
The image shows a pair of shoes with designs and text on them, including "Black Lives Matter." There is no clear connection between the text and the image, and the image does not provide any evidence or context that would make the text coherent or factual. The lack of coherence and the absence of a verifiable claim in the text, combined with an unrelated image, suggest that the post is likely to contain misinformation or is nonsensical.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a Game Boy Color with a screen displaying text in Japanese, which is consistent with the claim in the input text that the person had an untranslated version of Pokémon Silver. The presence of Japanese text on the game screen supports the statement that the game was not in English, which aligns with the user's experience of having an untranslated version. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Prediction:
The image shows a starfish on a rock, which is consistent with the text that talks about starfish. The image alone does not provide enough information to confirm or refute the recovery of starfish populations from the sea star wasting syndrome, but it does not contradict the text either. Without additional context or evidence to suggest otherwise, there is no clear indication of misinformation based on the image and text provided.
Text:
taking responsibility mark zuckerberg has announced that any articles posted on facebook will now go through strict vetting to make sure they align with the companys tireless commitment to generating massive amounts of revenue
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text appears to be satirical or sarcastic in nature, as it suggests that Facebook's commitment to vetting articles is tied to generating revenue rather than ensuring the accuracy or quality of information. The image shows Mark Zuckerberg, who is the CEO of Meta Platforms, Inc. (formerly known as Facebook, Inc.), but it does not provide any evidence to support the claim made in the text. The image alone does not confirm the authenticity of the statement, and without additional context or a reliable source, the text seems to be a piece of satire or misinformation.
Text:

Prediction: The image provided does not correlate with the text. The text discusses a man named Tim Tebow, who is associated with the NFL, while the image shows a woman at what appears to be a public event. There is no connection between the image and the content of the text, which suggests that the post may contain misinformation or that the image is not relevant to the text. Additionally, the text itself contains inaccuracies: Tim Tebow is a well-known figure whose career details are publicly documented and do not align with the claims in the text.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not support or relate to the claim made in the input text regarding intelligence officials and the Trump team's alleged contact with Russian officials during a campaign. The image appears to show a man at a sporting event, likely a hockey game given the context of the image, which has no apparent connection to the content of the text. Therefore, the image does not serve as evidence for the text, and the post may contain misinformation due to the inconsistency between the text and the image.
Text:
early th century pictures i found where they photoshoped the faces onto a different picture to the right and bottem one why and how would they do this
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided appears to be a collection of early 20th-century photographs. There is no clear evidence of Photoshop being used in these images, as Photoshop was not available until 1988. The text claims that the faces were "photoshoped" onto different pictures, but this is anachronistic and therefore not possible. However, photo manipulation did exist before the digital age, often through techniques like airbrushing, double exposure, or piecing together different negatives. Without more context or evidence of manipulation, it's not possible to definitively say that these specific photographs have been altered in such a way. Thus, the claim of Photoshop being used is incorrect, but there is no clear misinformation regarding photo manipulation in general, as it could have been done through other means available at the time.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image appears to be digitally altered, showing Bernie Sanders with a propeller beanie and wearing a striped bathing suit, which is inconsistent with his usual public appearance and the attire one would expect a politician to wear at a rally. The claim that he announced he is "years old" is also missing a number and seems nonsensical, suggesting that the text is likely a satirical take or a piece of misinformation. Bernie Sanders, being a public figure, would not likely attend a rally dressed in such an unusual and informal manner, nor would he make an announcement about his age that lacks specific information.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows two individuals, but it does not provide verifiable evidence that they are a UK couple or that they are rushing to a Thai hospital to give blood. The left side of the image shows a woman posing for a photo, which does not suggest any connection to a hospital or a blood donation scenario. The right side of the image shows a man with what appears to be a blood donation setup, but there is no context to confirm that he is in Thailand, that he is part of a couple, or that he is responding to an international appeal. The image alone does not confirm the specifics of the situation described in the text, and without additional context or verification, it is not possible to determine the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, based on the image alone, we cannot confirm the information provided in the text, which could indicate the presence of misinformation.
Text:

The image shows a pile of laundry with various items, including what appears to be a sheet and a pillowcase, which are tangled together. This visual evidence is consistent with the input text, which describes a scenario where new sheets and pillowcases have become knotted together in the dryer. There is nothing in the image to suggest that the text is providing misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that Germany has made it easier for people who bought solar panels and suggests that there has been a globally unprecedented reduction in car emissions as a reaction to these installations. However, the image provided shows a group of men, one prominently in the foreground, with a BBC News logo, and does not provide any visual evidence related to solar panels, car emissions, or environmental policies in Germany. The image appears to be a standard news report image and does not complement or provide evidence for the text's claims. Therefore, there is a discrepancy between the text and the image, indicating the presence of misinformation.
Text:

Prediction:
The image provided is a still from the movie "Platoon," which is a fictional portrayal of the Vietnam War directed by Oliver Stone. It is not an authentic photograph of actual soldiers from the Vietnam War. Therefore, the claim that the image is a genuine photo of someone's father who fought in Vietnam is misinformation.
Text:

Prediction:
The input text appears to be an incomplete sentence and does not provide any clear claim or statement that can be fact-checked or verified against the image. Additionally, the text seems to express a personal opinion or frustration rather than presenting factual information. The image provided is simply a portrait of a person and does not offer any context or evidence that could be used to assess the truthfulness of the text. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if there is misinformation based solely on the given text and image. However, the lack of coherence and context between the text and the image suggests that the post may be misleading or lack informative value, which could be interpreted as misinformation.
Text:
the game of fighting and wars between people journalism cartoon published on avanguardia milano portraying a jew and death moving their pieces on the europe
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image depicts a caricature of a Jewish person and a figure resembling Death playing a game of chess, which is a common metaphor for strategy and conflict. The Jewish figure is portrayed with exaggerated features that are historically associated with anti-Semitic stereotypes. The presence of the Star of David and the sickle and hammer, symbols associated with Judaism and communism respectively, on the cloak of the figure of Death suggests a linkage that is often used in anti-Semitic and conspiratorial narratives. The text describes the image as a "journalism cartoon published on avanguardia milano," which implies it is a piece of journalistic or editorial content. However, the portrayal of these figures in such a manner, especially in historical context, is often used to propagate harmful stereotypes and misinformation about Jewish people and their involvement in global affairs. Therefore, the post is likely to contain misinformation due to the use of anti-Semitic imagery and the suggestion of a conspiracy, which is a common form of misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a book cover with German text that translates to "The most profitable plundering ever committed." The cover also includes the text "The significance of the coal-rich Alsace-Lorraine according to official documents." This suggests that the book is indeed about the region of Alsace-Lorraine and its resources, which aligns with the input text's claim that it is a German book discussing the region and its historical context. There is no immediate evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Prediction:
The image shows a dog that could be described as loyal, which is consistent with the text's description of the dog staying by the side of its owner. There is no direct evidence in the image to contradict the text, and the image of the dog alone does not provide enough context to determine the veracity of the story. Therefore, based on the image and the text provided, there is no clear indication of misinformation.

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that the employees of ClickHole.com have voted to debase themselves to please billionaires, which suggests a situation of coercion or unethical influence. However, ClickHole is known for its satirical and humorous content, often parodying clickbait articles and sensationalist journalism. The image provided is the logo of ClickHole, which does not offer any factual evidence to support or refute the claim made in the text. Given the nature of ClickHole's content, it is likely that the text is satirical and not a genuine news report, thus indicating the presence of misinformation if taken at face value.

Prediction:
The text claims that the Trump administration granted a six-month extension to Haitians for temporary protection in the US, but the image provided does not confirm or deny this information. The image shows people, possibly Haitians, in a meeting or gathering, wearing attire with the Haitian flag, but it does not provide any evidence regarding the extension of temporary protection status. The lack of a date in the text and the absence of specific, verifiable details in the image make it impossible to confirm the claim's accuracy. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot determine whether the post contains misinformation.

a service dog actually voted for a new jersey assembly bill named for him legislators unanimously passed a bill that would impose fines on those who deny access to disabled people with service dogs
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a person with a service dog in what appears to be a legislative chamber, possibly giving a testimony or presentation. However, the claim that a service dog "actually voted" for a bill is not plausible as dogs cannot participate in legislative processes or cast votes. The text likely means that the bill was named after the service dog or that the service dog's situation inspired the bill, but the wording suggesting that the dog voted is misinformation.

in last year west midlands on the move launched the human power station outside coventry rail station these are exercise bikes which let you charge your mobile or tablets as you pedal
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided does not support the text. The text talks about an initiative called "West Midlands on the Move," which launched a human power station outside Coventry rail station where people can charge mobile devices by pedaling on exercise bikes. However, the image is related to a mental health awareness campaign called "Time to Talk Day" that took place on 07/02/19, as indicated by the text on the poster. There is no visual evidence of exercise bikes or any charging stations in the image. Therefore, the image does not corroborate the text, suggesting that there is a mismatch that could indicate misinformation.

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a sign for the Veterans Crisis Line, which is a resource for veterans who may be in crisis or at risk of suicide. The text discusses a new plan to prevent veteran suicides, including new community outreach grants. The image is consistent with the text in that it relates to veteran support and suicide prevention. There is no clear inconsistency or evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided.
Text:
famous extinct vombatiformes include the rhinolike diprotodon and the llama are not closely related to the title character of disneys film dumbo
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided is of a birdbath or a similar water feature and does not contain any visual information related to the text about extinct vombatiformes, the rhinolike diprotodon, llamas, or the Disney film character Dumbo. Therefore, the image neither confirms nor contradicts the text, and it cannot be used to assess the accuracy of the text. The text itself does not contain any inherent contradictions or misinformation based on the information provided. Vombatiformes are indeed an extinct group of marsupials, and the diprotodon is a well-known example. The statement about the llama and Dumbo's relationship is correct; llamas are not closely related to elephants, the species of the title character in Disney's "Dumbo."

year old girl too young to work as a counsellor at a camp for kids with cancer instead she raised k by becoming the youngest person to swim across lake ontario
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a young girl wrapped in a towel, appearing to be in a post-swim scenario with people around her who seem to be celebrating or supporting her. The presence of a towel, her wet hair, and the expressions of joy and accomplishment on the faces of the people suggest that she has completed a significant physical feat, such as a long-distance swim. This visual evidence is consistent with the Input Text, which claims that a young girl raised money by swimming across Lake Ontario. There is no clear indication of misinformation based on the image and the text provided.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows three men smiling and posing together, which could be consistent with a scenario where someone has found their family members after a long search. The man in the center is wearing a jersey that could suggest a sense of personal identity or heritage, which aligns with the text's narrative about searching for family and identity. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text provided. Without additional context or evidence to suggest otherwise, there is no clear indication of misinformation based on the image and text provided.
Text:
american infantrymen of the us armys nd infantry division buffalo soldiers division are photographed at rest in italy province of la spezia liguria
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a group of African American soldiers in military gear, which is consistent with the description of the "Buffalo Soldiers" division, a nickname for the all-black regiments within the U.S. Army that dates back to the post-Civil War era. However, the "Buffalo Soldiers" were associated with the 9th and 10th Cavalry Regiments and not an infantry division, and they were not part of the 92nd Infantry Division during World War II. The 92nd Infantry Division, known as the "Buffalo Division," was indeed an African American infantry division that served in Italy during World War II. The text incorrectly refers to the 92nd Infantry Division as the "Buffalo Soldiers Division," which is a historical inaccuracy and could lead to misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image is a poster that appears to be from the early 20th century, advertising "Koloniale Dagen" (Colonial Days) and includes the date "6 Juli 1924." The text on the poster is in Dutch and translates to "Colonial Days under the high patronage of HM the King." This matches the input text, which mentions "koloniale dagen onder de hooge bescherming van zm den koning" and refers to a monarchy and the 20th century. The image and the text are consistent with each other, suggesting that there is no misinformation based on the information provided.
Text:
falling sulfur dioxide emissions in the united states are expected to substantially increase rainfall in africas semiarid sahel while bringing slightly more rain to much of the us according to a new study in the journal of geophysical research atmospheres
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a group of people working on a farm, which could be located in a semiarid region like the Sahel. The content of the text discusses a study about the effects of falling sulfur dioxide emissions in the United States on rainfall in the Sahel and the US. While the image does not directly confirm the scientific findings of the study, it does not contradict the text either. The image is consistent with the type of region (semiarid) mentioned in the text, and there is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and text provided.

Label: 1
Prediction: The image shows a dog watching TV, and on the TV screen, there is an image of the same dog from behind, creating a recursive visual effect. The text describes a scenario where a dog is watching another dog, and so on, in a seemingly infinite loop. The image does not literally show an infinite number of dogs watching each other, but it does visually represent the concept described in the text in a humorous and exaggerated way. There is no clear misinformation present, as the text and image appear to be intentionally playful and not meant to be taken literally.
Text:
a recently discovered relic of the phallic empire archeologists have confirmed that the inscriptions near the base of the idol positively identify this location as the origins of the patriarchy in bce a modern phallanite worshipper can be seen in the foreground
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that the image shows a recently discovered relic of the "Phallic Empire" and suggests that the inscriptions near the base of the idol identify it as the origin of the patriarchy. The text also mentions a "modern Phallanite worshipper" in the foreground. This description raises several red flags for misinformation:
- The term "Phallic Empire" is not recognized as a historical empire or civilization by credible historical sources.
- The concept of an idol marking the origins of the patriarchy is dubious and not supported by historical evidence.
- The claim of a "modern Phallanite worshipper" seems satirical or fictional, as there is no widely recognized contemporary religious group known as "Phallanites" that worships phallic idols.
- The image itself does not provide any verifiable inscriptions or context that could support the text's claims. It simply shows a person standing near a tall, naturally occurring rock formation that somewhat resembles a phallic shape.
Given these points, the post appears to contain misinformation, as it presents a narrative that is not supported by historical evidence or credible sources.
Text:
during wwii soviet graphic artists learnt to distort reality and show what they wanted to show but not what really had happened they often added excessive nazi atrocities terrible ruins and looting to fill papers with horrifying images
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided is a Soviet military insignia, which does not inherently contain any misinformation. The text discusses the actions of Soviet graphic artists during WWII, claiming they distorted reality in their depictions of the war. The image does not contradict nor confirm the text's claim about the artists' actions, as it is simply a symbol and does not depict any events or actions. Therefore, based on the image alone, there is no evidence of misinformation. However, without historical context or additional evidence, the accuracy of the text's claim cannot be assessed.
Text:
an indonesian villager is encouraging rural children to read by delivering books with his free mobile library on the back of his favorite horse luna
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided does not contain any visual information that can be used to verify the claim made in the input text. It is a placeholder or loading image from the Reuters news agency, which does not show an Indonesian villager, children, books, a mobile library, or a horse named Luna. Therefore, based on the image provided, there is no way to confirm the authenticity of the text, which suggests the possibility of misinformation.
Text:
did folding inkblot art with the toddlers at work today one kid somehow managed to make a face cant figure out which celebrity it best resembles though
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows an inkblot art piece that resembles a symmetrical pattern often associated with the Rorschach test, which is a psychological test involving inkblots. The text mentions that a toddler created an inkblot that resembles a face, and although it's subjective, the inkblot in the image could be perceived as having facial features due to its symmetry and the common tendency of human perception to find patterns resembling faces in random shapes. There is no direct misinformation as the text simply describes an activity and a subjective observation without making any factual claims.
Text:
video calling all parents protect your children from pedophiles by reading the groundbreaking new ebook pedophile poundhouse supreme boyhouse eternal lick boys in the house the novel
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text and image appear to be promoting an ebook that claims to expose the pedophile underworld. However, the title of the book and the way it is presented in the image raise red flags about the legitimacy and intent of the content. The title "Pedophile Poundhouse: Supreme Boyhouse Eternal (Lick Boys in the House)" is provocative and seems to trivialize a very serious issue. Additionally, the image includes a logo that reads "PATRIOTHOLE," which suggests that the source may not be credible or may be satirical in nature. Given the sensitive nature of the topic and the questionable presentation, it is likely that this post contains misinformation or is not a genuine resource for protecting children from pedophiles.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a large inflatable structure with the distinctive face of Nicolas Cage, which is consistent with the description in the input text of a "giant inflatable sculpture of the actor." The presence of what appears to be a bouncy castle environment with a black and white striped pattern and two figures in front of the inflatable face suggests that this could indeed be part of an attraction where visitors can interact with the structure. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a person, who appears to be visually impaired due to the sunglasses and the white cane, sorting through LEGO bricks. This visual evidence supports the text's claim about an article discussing a young man and his friend/caregiver working to bring LEGO instructions to the visually impaired. There is no immediate indication of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
i have a single transverse palmar crease which is a single crease that extends across the palm of your hand which is found in people with down syndrome only of people without down syndrome of one
Label: 0
Prediction:
The text claims that a single transverse palmar crease is found only in people with Down syndrome, which is misinformation. While it is true that a single transverse palmar crease can be more common in individuals with Down syndrome, it is not exclusive to them. This crease can also be found in the general population without Down syndrome. The image shows a hand with a single transverse palmar crease, but this does not confirm the text's claim that it is only found in people with Down syndrome. Therefore, the text contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a man who appears to be a cafe owner, which is consistent with the narrative provided in the input text. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the story of a cafe owner growing concerned over a regular customer. Without additional context or evidence to suggest otherwise, there is no clear indication of misinformation based on the image and text provided.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a baby who appears to be trying to climb up onto a sofa, which is consistent with the input text describing a month-old daughter starting to stand while holding onto things and trying to climb up to the parent sitting on the living room sofa. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image provided appears to be consistent with the input text. It shows a dark night sky with several points of light that could be stars, which is what one might expect to see when taking a photo of the night sky with a phone camera, especially in a location with low light pollution like the Catalan Pyrenees. The stars visible in the image do show different colors, which could be described as "weird and intriguing," as mentioned in the text. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided.
Text:
this document given to my grandfather by henry wallace after my grandfather was the first doctor to treat him following his assassination attempt
Label: 0
Prediction:
The text claims that the document was given to the submitter's grandfather by Henry Wallace after an assassination attempt. However, Henry Wallace was the 33rd Vice President of the United States under Franklin D. Roosevelt and there are no historical records of an assassination attempt on him. Additionally, the image shows a document from the Governor of the State of Alabama, which does not align with the claim that it was from Henry Wallace. The inconsistency between the historical record and the claim, as well as the discrepancy between the text and the image, suggests that this post contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided is a portrait of a person and does not contain any information that can be used to verify the claims made in the input text. The text discusses funding for lead removal in Lansing, Michigan, and without additional context or evidence, there is no basis to determine whether the text contains misinformation based solely on the image provided. The image and the text are not directly related in a way that would allow for an assessment of the text's accuracy.
Text:
critically endangered kakapo the worlds fattest parrot has record breeding season just adult kakapo are alive today in their native new zealand but scientists hope their fortunes are turning around
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows what appears to be a kakapo, which is indeed a critically endangered parrot known to be the world's heaviest, along with its chick. The presence of the chick could be indicative of a breeding season. The logo of "The Guardian," a reputable news organization, suggests that the image is likely to be from a credible source. There is no immediate evidence of inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. The text claims that the kakapo has had a record breeding season and that there are hopes for the species' recovery, which is a plausible scenario that the image does not contradict.
Text:
the kansas supreme court has struck down a voterapproved ordinance in wichita that reduced penalties for possessing small amounts of marijuana
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided is a logo for the Topeka Capital-Journal, which is a legitimate news organization. There is no direct evidence in the image that contradicts the claim made in the input text. The text states a legal decision by the Kansas Supreme Court regarding a marijuana ordinance in Wichita, and without additional context or evidence to the contrary, there is no basis to assume that the information is false based solely on the logo of a news outlet. Therefore, there is no clear indication of misinformation from the image itself. However, to fully determine the accuracy of the text, one would need to cross-reference the claim with credible legal sources or news reports.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided is a screenshot from the video game "Pokémon," showing a character named Professor Oak asking the player whether they are a boy or a girl. This is a standard part of the game's introduction and character customization process. The image has no relation to the input text, which discusses a serious issue of visitors engaging in prostitution in Thailand and a specific case involving a retired professor. The image does not support or provide evidence for the text, indicating that the post contains misinformation by presenting an unrelated image as if it were relevant to the serious claim being made.
Text:

Prediction:
The image shows a dog that appears to be well-cared for and matches the description provided in the input text. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image. The text speaks about a personal experience with a dog, and the image supports this narrative.
Text:
a pilot diverted his aircraft yesterday to ensure irish patients en route to wales for vital cataract procedures would not end up back on the health service waiting list
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows an aircraft in flight, which is consistent with the text that mentions a pilot diverting his aircraft. There is no direct contradiction between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. However, without additional context or sources to verify the pilot's actions and the reasons behind them, it is not possible to definitively confirm the accuracy of the text. The image alone does not provide enough information to determine the veracity of the claim regarding the pilot's intentions or the situation with the patients and the health service waiting list.
Text:
a mock album i made for myself based upon frank sinatras mugshot sweet vii on underground chronicles an album i dream to mask of all my favorite locals collaborating
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text describes a mock album created by the individual, inspired by Frank Sinatra's mugshot, and the image appears to be a stylized album cover that aligns with the description given. The image shows a person with a mugshot board, and the design is consistent with the concept of a mock or tribute album cover. There is no direct claim of factual information that can be verified as true or false, and the text clearly states it is a personal creative project, so there is no misinformation present.
Text:
what would remain of the entente if they were honest about the right of selfdetermination of their own peoples and let go of the reins germany
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image is a historical propaganda map that seems to be from the World War I era, depicting various countries as animals with reins and lines connecting them, which suggests control or alliances. The text on the image is in German and translates to "What would remain of the Entente if they were honest about the right of self-determination of their own peoples and let go of the reins." The input text is an English translation of this German text.
The image and the text are consistent with each other in terms of the message they convey. However, the task is to predict whether misinformation is present by assessing the consistency between the text and the image. Since the image is a piece of historical propaganda, it is inherently biased and designed to convey a specific political message from the perspective of the creator, which may not be an accurate representation of the historical facts or the political situation at the time. Propaganda often contains misinformation or biased interpretations to influence public opinion.
Therefore, while the text and image are consistent with each other, the nature of the image as propaganda suggests that the post (from which the text and image are derived) may contain misinformation due to the biased and persuasive intent of such materials.
Text:
russia to sex and the city star ambassador would be a public health crisis lawmaker wants to tax porn users to follow it on vacation police say
Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text is incoherent and seems to be a random string of words related to various unrelated topics, such as Russia, a "Sex and the City" star, a public health crisis, a lawmaker wanting to tax porn users, and police saying something about following on vacation. The image provided shows a person washing dishes, which has no apparent connection to any of the topics mentioned in the text. The lack of coherence and relevance between the text and the image suggests that the post containing this text and image likely contains misinformation or is nonsensical.
Text:
larry was showing off his new tattoo and flip phone and out of nowhere a bewildered guy tries to start a game of leapfrog a nearby cat is disgusted by another cats hat
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image does not accurately represent the text provided. The text mentions several specific elements: a new tattoo, a flip phone, a bewildered guy trying to start a game of leapfrog, and a cat disgusted by another cat's hat. However, the image shows a person leaping over an inflatable figure, a man sitting with a flip phone, and two cats with one wearing a bag on its head, which does not correspond to a hat. There is no evidence of a new tattoo being shown off, nor does the image depict a game of leapfrog being initiated by a bewildered person. The cats do not appear to be interacting in a way that suggests one is disgusted by the other's hat. The inconsistencies between the text and the image suggest that the post contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a news report with the caption "MOTHER'S DAY GIFT BAGS GIVEN TO RESCUE MISSION," which is consistent with the input text stating that a woman donated gift bags to women at the Nashville Rescue Mission on Mother's Day weekend. The image supports the text, and there is no indication of misinformation based on the information provided.
Text:
sorry for bad quality red robin has a sign talking about total occupancy and at the bottom it says unless full of elephants it would be way less
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a sign with the text "MAXIMUM Occupancy 211" on what appears to be a red surface, likely a wall or a door. The text in the image does not mention anything about elephants, which suggests that the claim made in the input text about the sign mentioning an occupancy limit related to being "full of elephants" is not supported by the image. The image is of low quality, but the visible information does not contradict the standard information one would expect on an occupancy sign. Therefore, there is no evidence of misinformation based on the image provided and the text description.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows an adult, presumably a man, kissing a young child on the cheek. The affectionate gesture is consistent with what one might expect from a reunion between a father and his daughter, which aligns with the input text describing a father being reunited with his daughter. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a man, presumably an executive or spokesperson, with the Alaska Airlines logo in the background. This is consistent with the Input Text, which mentions Alaska Airlines. The image does not contradict the claim made in the text about the airline using a renewable alternative jet fuel. Without additional context or evidence to the contrary, there is no clear indication of misinformation based solely on the image and the text provided.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows two individuals in what appears to be a wooded area, which could be consistent with the claim of someone living in the woods. However, there is no clear evidence in the image that supports the specific claim about Trinity Fletcher earning her high school diploma after such circumstances. The image does not show a diploma, a graduation ceremony, or any other educational context that would corroborate the text. Without additional context or evidence, we cannot confirm the information provided in the text, and therefore, it is possible that the post contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a page from a book that appears to describe an experiment related to emotions and cognition. The text in the image mentions a technique where subjects repeat an emotion word like "anger" over and over until the word becomes just a sound, which is described as mentally disconnecting from its meaning. This is consistent with the input text, which describes a similar concept of saying a word so many times that it loses its meaning, likened to a temporary brain lesion but harmless. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the input text and the image.
Text:
news public interrogation every senator is angrily grilling mark zuckerberg on why clickholes articles arent getting shared as widely on facebook after it changed its algorithms
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows what appears to be a senator speaking at a public hearing, which could be consistent with a news report about a public interrogation. However, the claim that every senator is angrily grilling Mark Zuckerberg specifically on why ClickHole's articles aren't getting shared as widely on Facebook after it changed its algorithms seems implausible. ClickHole is a satirical website known for parodying clickbait articles, and it is highly unlikely that a senate hearing would focus on such a specific and satirical issue. The text seems to be satirical or fabricated, and the image does not provide any evidence to support the specific claim made in the text. Therefore, this post likely contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided is a logo of "The Sydney Morning Herald," which is a newspaper and does not visually confirm or deny the information provided in the text about a DJ in Beirut using a popular night club for a recycling program and clothing donation for refugees. The image and the text are not directly related, and the image does not serve as evidence for the text's claims. Therefore, based on the inconsistency between the text and the image, it is possible that the post contains misinformation. However, without further context or evidence, it is not possible to definitively determine the accuracy of the text.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a street mural that commemorates the "Belfast men who fought against fascism" in the Spanish Civil War as part of the International Brigade. The text on the mural mentions the fight against fascism, which is consistent with the input text that talks about a street mural celebrating Irish antifascists who fought in the Spanish Civil War. The themes of republicanism, antifascism, and anticapitalism are also visually represented in the mural with the breaking of chains and the opposition to fascism and capitalism. There is no evident inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided is of LEGO figures, which are toys and not real people. The text describes a serious and somber event involving a person's grandfather being ambushed by a Vietcong soldier. The image does not support the text as it does not depict a real-life event or scenario but rather shows characters from the LEGO universe, which is inconsistent with the gravity of the situation described in the text. Therefore, the post contains misinformation due to the inconsistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Prediction: The image shows a dog that appears to be in an indoor setting, possibly a shelter or pet store, which is consistent with the text's description of a dog that has been in a shelter. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the information provided in the text. Therefore, there is no evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided.

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided does not offer any evidence to support or refute the claim made in the input text. It is simply a photo of a person in a uniform, which does not provide any context regarding the alleged incident of a firefighter being ticketed. Without additional information or context, it is not possible to determine the accuracy of the text based on the image alone. Therefore, the prediction of misinformation is based on the lack of corroborating evidence in the image rather than a definitive contradiction between the text and the image.
Text:

Prediction:
The image shows the inside of a beer stein being held up to a light source, and there is indeed an image of a person at the bottom that is visible, which is consistent with the claim made in the input text. Therefore, there is no indication of misinformation based on the provided text and image.

dose entire population with antimalaria drugs to eradicate disease study malaria could be quickly eliminated in southeast asia by an allout effort to dose whole populations with drugs that treat the disease regardless of whether people have symptoms or are healthy say experts
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a mosquito on a human skin with a logo from "The Guardian" and a timestamp from "2018". The text talks about a study suggesting that malaria could be quickly eliminated in Southeast Asia by dosing whole populations with antimalarial drugs. However, the image does not provide any evidence to support the claim made in the text. The timestamp from 2018 may also indicate that the image is outdated in relation to the current context of the text. The image itself is generic and does not confirm or refute the text's claim about the eradication strategy for malaria. Therefore, without additional context or evidence, we cannot confirm the text's claim based on the image provided, and it is possible that the post contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a person receiving a cup of liquid, which could be medication or a form of treatment. There is no direct contradiction between the image and the text regarding the claim that most people addicted to opioids receive no treatment. The image does not provide enough context to confirm or refute the claim made in the text. Therefore, based on the image alone, we cannot conclude that there is misinformation present. However, the claim made in the text about the reasons why people addicted to opioids receive no treatment (funding, bureaucracy, and fear of perpetuating addiction) is a complex issue that would require more context and evidence to assess for misinformation.

the hardy tree in st pancras churchyard london work of novelist thomas hardy he had to stack headstones due to new railway line running through the graveyard the tree grew up through and around the headstones its exposed by recently cut hedging its usually hard to see from the side
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a tree with a number of headstones stacked around its base, which is consistent with the Input Text description of the Hardy Tree in St Pancras Churchyard, London. The text mentions that Thomas Hardy was involved in stacking the headstones due to a new railway line, and the tree grew around them. The image appears to support this narrative, showing the headstones in close proximity to the tree, suggesting that they have been there for a significant amount of time, long enough for the tree to grow around them. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.

professional sumo wrestler oosunaarashi lifts a local fans baby outside of the tournament hall making it less than comfortable as a few of his colleagues jovially look on
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a sumo wrestler lifting a baby high up with one hand, while another sumo wrestler and a woman, possibly also associated with sumo wrestling due to their attire, are looking on with smiles. The baby does not appear to be in distress, but rather has a typical uncomfortable expression that babies often have in unfamiliar situations. The text describes a professional sumo wrestler lifting a local fan's baby outside of a tournament hall, with colleagues looking on. The image is consistent with the text, showing a sumo wrestler interacting with a baby in a public setting, and there are other individuals present who are observing the situation with amusement. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
i work at a printing company just looked at the file for these checks we are producing the endorsement lines on the back are actually teeny tiny unreadable words
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a close-up of the endorsement area on the back of a check. The text claims that the endorsement lines contain "teeny tiny unreadable words," suggesting some form of hidden or deceptive content. However, the image clearly shows that the words "TAMPERGUARD" are printed in a pattern that is meant to indicate a security feature designed to prevent tampering. The words are not "teeny tiny" nor are they unreadable; they are clearly legible and serve a legitimate purpose. Therefore, the text contains misinformation as it inaccurately describes the security feature on the checks.
Text:
the victorious red army entering beijing possibly from the s interesting use of traditional chinese diffusedperspective scrollpainting for communist and for depicting modern objects such as trucks tanks etc
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided is indeed a traditional Chinese scroll painting that depicts a large procession with many figures and what appears to be a significant event in a historical setting. However, there are no modern objects such as trucks or tanks visible in the image. Traditional Chinese scroll paintings are known for their historical and cultural themes, often not including modern machinery, especially not from the 20th century when trucks and tanks were in use. The text claims that the painting depicts the Red Army entering Beijing with modern objects like trucks and tanks, but the image does not support this claim. Therefore, the post contains misinformation.
Text:
a stonehenge has been discovered in brazil same layout same structure leading many to believe that years ago we were all way more interconnected than we once thought
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a structure that resembles a megalithic arrangement similar to Stonehenge, but the claim that "a Stonehenge has been discovered in Brazil with the same layout and same structure" is misleading. While there are indeed ancient megalithic structures found in Brazil, known as the Amazon Stonehenge or "Calçoene," they are not identical to the Stonehenge in England. The structures may share similarities in that they are both megalithic and may have astronomical significance, but they are not the same in layout and structure. The text implies a direct correlation that may lead to the incorrect assumption that the structures are identical and that this discovery is a recent one, which may not be the case. Therefore, the post contains misinformation due to the misleading comparison and the lack of specificity regarding the differences between the two sites.

key facts about asian americans a diverse and growing population the us asian population grew between and from million to million the fastest growth rate of any major racial or ethnic group
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a graph from the Pew Research Center indicating that the Asian population in the U.S. has grown 72% since 2000. The numbers on the graph show an increase from 10.2 million in 2000 to 20.4 million in 2015. This data is consistent with the input text, which states that the U.S. Asian population grew from 2000 to 2015 and indicates that it was the fastest growth rate of any major racial or ethnic group. The image complements the text and provides evidence for the statement made in the text. There is no indication of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
hermann goring head of the german luftwaffe goes from elation at the german bombings of warsaw rotterdam and belgrade to horror at the british bombings of lubeck rostock and cologne in this raf leaflet
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a series of portraits with different expressions, labeled with the names of cities: Warsaw, Rotterdam, Belgrade, Lübeck, Rostock, and Köln (Cologne). The text describes a change in Hermann Göring's reactions to bombings during World War II, suggesting that the image is a leaflet that illustrates this change. However, the image does not provide clear evidence of Göring's emotional transition from elation to horror. Instead, it shows a sequence of faces with varying expressions, which could be interpreted in many ways. The connection between the expressions and the specific events mentioned in the text is not visually evident in the image. Therefore, without additional context to support the text, the post could be misleading, as the image alone does not substantiate the claim about Göring's reactions.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text mentions Mike Pence and an attack by the Huffington Post, referencing something that happened in the woods of Transylvania. However, the image shows a person standing next to the American flag, which does not correlate with the text. The person in the image is not Mike Pence, and there is no indication of the Huffington Post or any event in Transylvania. The inconsistency between the text and the image suggests that the post may contain misinformation.
Text:
chinese scientists working with a chinese philanthropist have nearly eradicated malaria from the small african nation of comoros now theyre setting their sights on a far more ambitious location kenya
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a group of individuals who appear to be engaged in a conversation in a formal setting, which could be consistent with a gathering of scientists or philanthropists. However, the image does not provide any specific evidence to directly confirm or refute the claim made in the text about Chinese scientists and a philanthropist working to eradicate malaria in Comoros or their plans for Kenya. Therefore, based solely on the image and the text provided, there is no clear indication of misinformation. To accurately determine the veracity of the claim, additional context and verification from credible sources would be required.
Text:
one of africas largest wildlife preserves is marking a year without a single elephant found killed by poachers which experts call an extraordinary development in an area larger than switzerland where thousands of the animals have been slaughtered in recent years
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a herd of elephants in a natural habitat that appears to be a wildlife preserve, which is consistent with the text's claim about an African wildlife preserve. There is no visible evidence of poaching in the image, and the presence of a healthy-looking elephant herd could be seen as supporting the text's claim that no elephants have been killed by poachers in a year. Therefore, based on the information provided, there is no clear indication of misinformation between the text and the image.
Text:
abraham lincoln and his wife mary enjoying the play our american cousin at fords theatre lincoln was shot by james wilkes booth right after this photo was taken
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided is an animated depiction and not an authentic photograph from the time of Abraham Lincoln. Photography during Lincoln's time did not have the capability to capture such vibrant, high-definition color images, and certainly not in the animated style shown. Additionally, the characters in the image appear to be modern, stylized animations rather than historical figures. Therefore, the claim that this image was taken right before Abraham Lincoln was shot is misinformation.
Text:
this amazing new product called monocle glue ensures your monocle wont go flying off your face when your daughter tells you shes marrying a commoner
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims the existence of a product called "monocle glue" that prevents a monocle from falling off one's face in a dramatic situation. The image shows a man wearing a top hat and holding a monocle, which does not provide any evidence of the product's existence or effectiveness. The concept of "monocle glue" seems far-fetched and humorous, suggesting that the text is likely a satirical or fictional statement rather than a factual claim about a real product. Therefore, it is probable that this post contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image appears to be a historical Japanese election campaign poster, which is consistent with the text's description. However, without the ability to translate and verify the exact content of the Japanese text in the poster, it is not possible to definitively determine whether the English text provided is an accurate representation of the Japanese text. Therefore, there is a potential for misinformation if the English text does not accurately reflect the Japanese text.
Text:
chineseamerican architect i m pei one of the worlds greatest modern architects who won awards like the pritzker prize the nobel prize of architecture and designed some of the most iconic structures like the glass pyramid at the musee du louvre dies at
Label: 0
Prediction: The text states that I. M. Pei, a Chinese-American architect, has passed away. It mentions his achievements and one of his iconic works, the glass pyramid at the Musée du Louvre. The image shows an individual who appears to be I. M. Pei, based on his publicly known appearance, and he is clapping and smiling. Although the image does not directly confirm the information about his death, there is no inherent inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. The text's claims about his achievements and works are accurate. However, without a specific date of death in the text, it cannot be confirmed or denied by the image alone.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a boy sitting on a couch surrounded by a large number of cards and packages, which is consistent with the text stating that the Eubanks received hundreds of cards and presents from around the world after a call to action on Reddit. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided.
Text:
considering the artistry of some of the recent submissions i thought i would take things down a notch or twenty enjoy this collection of gems from the political masterminds at tea party nation and marvel as they learn how to use photoshop
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text suggests that the image is likely to be a product of amateurish use of Photoshop by a political group. The image shows a sign with the word "SOCIALISTS" and "SPREADING THE WEALTH SINCE 1917," which implies a political message. The presence of historical figures in the image suggests it may have been altered or created to convey a specific political message, which aligns with the text's implication of Photoshop use. However, without more context or the ability to verify the authenticity of the image, it is not possible to definitively determine if the image is genuine or altered. The text's sarcastic tone suggests skepticism about the image's authenticity, which could indicate that the image is intended as satire or misinformation.
Text:
erasmus receiving the divine inspiration for his textus receptus greek translation of the bible still considered holy by many modern christians
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image does not support the text provided. The image shows a modern individual with a small red book attached to the side of their head with a headset. This does not depict Erasmus, a Renaissance humanist, receiving divine inspiration for his work on the Textus Receptus. The Textus Receptus is a critical edition of the Greek New Testament from the Renaissance period, and the image is clearly contemporary and does not relate to the historical context of Erasmus or the creation of the Textus Receptus. Therefore, the image does not provide evidence for the text, suggesting misinformation in the post.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a boy holding a cat, which is consistent with the story of a cat that saved a boy from a dog attack. The cat's presence with the boy in the image supports the narrative provided in the text. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
i found this s bennington marble while out today this is a clay marble fired in the kiln you can even see the screen marks from when i was in the kiln best find of the year so far
Label: 0
Prediction:
The text claims that the marble shown is a "Bennington marble," which is a type of clay marble that has been fired in a kiln, and it also mentions that screen marks from the kiln are visible on the marble. However, the image shows a marble with a pattern that does not resemble typical screen marks from a kiln firing process. Instead, the pattern looks more like a natural or painted design rather than something created by a screen during firing. Bennington marbles are known for their glazed surface with often blue or brown patterns, but they do not typically have grid-like patterns that would be described as "screen marks." Therefore, the inconsistency between the text's description and the appearance of the marble in the image suggests that there may be misinformation present regarding the identification of the marble.
Text:
after beating main story can i sell stolen potsuseless stolen things in skyrim what did you choose the lesser of two evils to join the stormcloaks major dark brotherhood hoodie
Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text appears to be a jumbled mix of phrases related to the video game "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim." It mentions selling stolen items, choosing factions, and a "major dark brotherhood hoodie," which seems to be a reference to in-game content. The image shows a character from "Skyrim," which is consistent with the text's reference to the game. However, the text itself is incoherent and does not form a logical statement or question. It seems to be a random assortment of keywords and phrases related to the game rather than a post with a clear intent or claim. Therefore, while the image is relevant to "Skyrim," the text does not provide any verifiable information or claim that can be fact-checked against the image. The prediction of misinformation is based on the nonsensical nature of the text rather than a direct inconsistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a person who appears to be Ted Nugent, wearing a camouflage hat and shirt, which is consistent with his known public persona as a musician and pro-hunting advocate. The claim that he and other hunters have donated meals through programs like Hunters for the Hungry is plausible and aligns with known charitable activities associated with hunting communities. There is no direct evidence in the image to contradict the text, and without further information, there is no basis to assume misinformation in the post based on the image and text provided.
Text:
one of the whale populations taken to the edge of extinction by commercial hunting in the early th century has essentially recovered its numbers its reckoned there are now just short of individuals in the southwest atlantic more than of the preexploitation level
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a whale, which is consistent with the text discussing whale populations. There is no direct evidence in the image to suggest misinformation regarding the recovery of whale populations. The text claims that a specific whale population has recovered to near pre-exploitation levels, and the image does not contradict this statement. However, without specific scientific data or sources to verify the exact numbers and the status of the whale population mentioned, it is not possible to definitively confirm the accuracy of the text solely based on the image. The image itself does not provide any information that would indicate the presence of misinformation.
Text:
americas two year battle from terrorist target to freedoms superpower american magazine from to commemorate the end of the iraq and afghanistan wars pages
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that the magazine is to commemorate the end of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, suggesting that these wars concluded within a two-year period. However, the Iraq War began in 2003 and officially ended in 2011, while the Afghanistan War started in 2001 and the significant presence of US troops did not end until 2021. The image shows a magazine cover with the title "How America Changed the World" and a subtitle that reads "America's Two-Year Battle: Terrorist Target to Freedom's Superpower," which implies a two-year timeframe for a transformation rather than the actual duration of the wars. The inconsistency between the actual durations of the wars and the two-year period mentioned in both the text and the image suggests that there is misinformation present regarding the length and conclusion of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
Text:

Prediction:
The image shows a child in a hospital bed wearing a virtual reality headset, which is consistent with the text's description of a sick kid in the hospital using virtual reality. There is no direct evidence in the image to suggest that the child chose to virtually visit the hospital across town, but the image does not contradict the text either. Without further context or evidence to the contrary, we cannot assume misinformation based solely on the image and text provided.
Text:
cash backing to remake scotland a wastefree economy the cash is from the scottish institute for remanufacture supported by the government to create a wastefree circular economy remanufacturing is a process that takes old but highvalue products and restores them to an asnew condition
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows what appears to be a before-and-after comparison of a product, possibly a mechanical part, which has been remanufactured. The left side of the image shows the product in an old or used state, and the right side shows the same product looking restored and in a much cleaner, "as-new" condition. This visual evidence supports the text's claim about remanufacturing being a process that restores old but high-value products to an as-new condition. Additionally, the presence of the BBC News logo suggests that the image is sourced from a reputable news organization, which lends credibility to the information presented. There is no clear indication of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
heres a football signed by all of the patriots at the first super bowl starting the bradybelichick dynasty bill belichicks signature right under the laces
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a football with signatures, but there is insufficient evidence to confirm that it is signed by all of the Patriots from the first Super Bowl starting the Brady-Belichick dynasty, nor can it be confirmed that Bill Belichick's signature is right under the laces. The visible signature does not provide enough information to verify the claim, and without additional context or authentication, the claim cannot be substantiated. Therefore, the post may contain misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a tree with a rope that has been partially engulfed by the tree's growth, which is consistent with the input text's description. Trees can indeed grow around objects that are left attached to them for long periods, such as ropes. The text mentions that the previous owners had leashed their dog to the tree using a climbing rope, and over time the tree grew around the rope. The image supports this claim, showing the rope embedded in the tree trunk, indicating that it has been there for a significant amount of time. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a makeshift shelter or encampment, which could be indicative of homelessness or a lack of adequate housing. This visual does not align with the text's description of a successful "project restoration" that provides "proactive unconditional and comprehensive care" for the most vulnerable. If the project were as effective as described, one would not expect to see an image of what appears to be a vulnerable living situation. The inconsistency between the text and the image suggests that there may be misinformation present in the post.
Text:

Prediction: The image shows a sunset with a distinct split in the coloration of the sky, which is consistent with the description provided in the input text. The text claims to show a "split sunset" and the image indeed reflects this phenomenon. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not show Paul Syverson, David Goldschlag, and Michael Reed, nor does it depict any scene of mathematicians at the Naval Research Laboratory initiating research that would lead to the development of the Tor project. Instead, the image shows a thumbnail for a video segment titled "Nick Cannon goes undercover on the Internet," which is unrelated to the text provided. Therefore, there is a clear inconsistency between the text and the image, indicating that the post contains misinformation.
Text:
leonardo dicaprio hands over brandos oscar a picasso and more to the us government as part of an investigation into a malaysian moneylaundering scheme
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows Leonardo DiCaprio at an event, which is consistent with the text mentioning him by name. However, the image does not provide any evidence or contradiction to the claim about him handing over Marlon Brando's Oscar, a Picasso, or any other items to the US government as part of an investigation into a Malaysian money laundering scheme. The image is a generic one of DiCaprio and does not confirm or refute the text's claim. Therefore, based solely on the image and the text provided, there is no clear indication of misinformation. However, without additional context or evidence, it is not possible to definitively determine the accuracy of the text's claim.
Text:
a lot of people already know this but for those of you that dont this is a snake that use to exist the name was titanaboa it was around feet long and its diet consisted of crocodiles and alligators
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image appears to be an artist's rendition of the prehistoric snake known as Titanoboa. However, the text claims that the Titanoboa "use to exist" and was "around feet long," but it does not specify the length. Titanoboa is indeed an extinct species of snake that lived approximately 58 to 60 million years ago and could grow up to 42 feet long. The text also states that its diet consisted of crocodiles and alligators, which is consistent with scientific hypotheses about its diet, given its size and the era it lived in. However, the lack of specificity in the text about the length of the Titanoboa and the fact that the image is an artistic interpretation rather than actual evidence makes it difficult to determine the accuracy of the information. The image alone does not provide enough context to confirm or refute the text's claims, but the text's vagueness and the artistic nature of the image suggest that the post could potentially contain misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a glass panel with a mosaic or pattern that includes a depiction of a bird, which could be interpreted as a firebird, the school mascot mentioned in the text. The bird figure is indeed painted or marked on tiles that appear to be lighter or faded compared to the surrounding tiles, which is consistent with the description provided in the input text. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Prediction:
The image shows a graphic of two hands holding a heart, which is a common symbol of kindness and love. This complements the text, which talks about World Kindness Day and stories of unexpected acts of kindness from strangers. There is no inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation.
Text:
waiting for the signal from home cartoon by dr seuss published in pm accusing the japanese americans in the west of being an honourable fifth column united states
Label: 1
Prediction:
The cartoon by Dr. Seuss indeed depicts Japanese Americans in a negative light, suggesting they are waiting for a signal to act against the United States, which aligns with the description of them being an "honorable fifth column." However, the term "honorable" is likely used sarcastically here. The cartoon was published during World War II in a period of widespread distrust and racism against Japanese Americans, which led to their internment. The image and the text are consistent with each other in terms of content, but the message conveyed is historically recognized as a form of misinformation and racist propaganda, as there was no credible evidence that Japanese Americans as a group were acting as a fifth column for Japan.

The image shows a collection of blood test vials, which is consistent with the input text discussing a blood test for Alzheimer's disease. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the information provided in the text. The image complements the text by depicting what could be a scene from a medical laboratory where blood tests like the one described could be conducted. Without further context or expertise to dispute the claims made in the text, there is no clear evidence of misinformation based solely on the image and the text provided.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction: The image shows a poster with the phrase "Por una Patria Justicialista La Vida Por Peron" which translates to "For a Justicialist Fatherland My Life for Peron," consistent with the input text. The poster appears to be a political or propaganda poster related to Argentina and Peronism, featuring a man holding a flag and a crowd of people, which aligns with the description of a poster depicting support for Peron. There is no direct evidence in the image to suggest that it depicts José Ignacio Rucci or that it is related to his murder by the Montoneros, but the text does not claim that the image shows Rucci himself, only that it is a poster from the era and context of his association with Peron. Therefore, there is no clear inconsistency between the text and the image that would indicate misinformation.
Text:

Prediction:
The image shows the logo of ABC7, which is a legitimate television station. The text describes an event that is consistent with the type of human interest story that local news stations often cover, such as a Make-A-Wish event for a child with leukemia. There is no direct inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. However, without additional context or the ability to verify the current events, I cannot definitively confirm the accuracy of the text. The assessment is based solely on the consistency between the text and the image provided.

Prediction: The image shows a section of an unfinished bridge or elevated roadway, which is consistent with the topic of infrastructure investment mentioned in the input text. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image. The image could be used to represent the type of infrastructure projects that the Invest in America Act aims to fund.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text describes a scenario where a "little coffee" is personified, experiencing terror and fear. However, the image shows a cup of coffee with no indication of personification or emotions. Coffee, being an inanimate object, cannot experience emotions such as terror or fear. The text attempts to attribute human-like qualities to the coffee, which is misleading in the context of the image provided. Therefore, the post contains misinformation due to the inconsistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Prediction:
The image shows a person with tattoos on their arms, which is consistent with the input text stating that a tattoo artist helped cover scars from self-harm. The tattoos could indeed serve the purpose of covering such scars, and the text does not make any claims that are inherently implausible or contradictory to what is shown in the image. Therefore, there is no clear indication of misinformation based on the provided text and image.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided is a screenshot from the video game Minecraft, which features characters in a virtual environment that is clearly distinguishable from real-life photography due to its blocky, pixelated graphics. The text claims that the individual's father fought in Vietnam and implies that the photo is a genuine historical photograph that was discovered online. Since the image is from a video game and not a photograph from the Vietnam War, there is a clear inconsistency between the text and the image, indicating that misinformation is present.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a person in handcuffs, which could imply an arrest or detainment situation. However, the image does not provide any evidence or context to support the claim made in the text about an innocent black man being killed by police. Without additional context or evidence, the image does not confirm or refute the statement, making it impossible to determine the veracity of the text based solely on the image. Therefore, the prediction of misinformation is based on the lack of supporting evidence in the image for the claim made in the text.

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text makes several disjointed claims, including an accusation against someone named Rogier Kahlmann, a mention of a victory against "crybullies," a call to donate to debunk an "antiporn study," and a reference to a "paul feige reboot." The image shows a YouTube video titled "The Dark Side Of Gaming - The Females Fighting Back | EXCLUSIVE," which does not seem to directly support or provide evidence for any of the specific claims made in the text. The text itself is incoherent and seems to mix unrelated topics without clear context or evidence. The image does not corroborate the text, and the text's disjointed nature raises suspicion about its credibility. Therefore, it is likely that the post contains misinformation.

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a woman who appears to be speaking or shouting in a public setting, possibly at a meeting or a town hall, with other people in the background. However, the image does not provide any evidence or context that would confirm the claims made in the text about brain cancer rates, a defense contractor, radioactive waste, or contaminated water. Without additional information or evidence to support the text, the image does not validate the claims, and therefore, it is possible that the post contains misinformation.

Prediction: The text provided appears to be a translation of the text in the image, which is a poster likely from the Soviet era. The poster lists consequences for certain behaviors such as getting drunk, playing truant, and violating public order. These consequences include losing the thirteenth wage, bonuses, a place in the housing queue, summer holidays, and the respect of peers. The translation in the input text matches the content of the image, suggesting that there is no misinformation between the text and the image.

ny state researchers just declared that onondaga lake once one of the most polluted lakes in the world is now clean enough to swim in ending a ban that has lasted years
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a lake with clear water and people standing by the shore, which could be consistent with a lake that is clean enough for swimming. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the claim made in the text about Onondaga Lake being declared clean enough to swim in. Without additional context or evidence to the contrary, there is no clear indication of misinformation based on the image and the text provided.
Text:
law enforcement in the united states armed and dangerous noknock raids assault weapons and armoured cars americas police use paramilitary tactics too often
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a group of figures dressed in tactical gear, which could be consistent with law enforcement units equipped for high-risk operations. However, the image alone does not provide enough context to determine whether it accurately represents the frequency of paramilitary tactics used by American police, as claimed in the text. The text makes a broad claim about the frequency of paramilitary tactics being used "too often" by American police, which is a subjective statement and requires statistical evidence to support it. Without additional context or evidence, the image does not confirm or refute the claim made in the text, but the use of the term "too often" suggests a subjective judgment that cannot be substantiated by the image alone. Therefore, the post could be considered to contain misinformation due to the lack of supporting evidence for the frequency of the tactics mentioned.
Text:
war bonds poster with both characters modeled on charles beach by jc leyendecker who more than a years ago was the gay artist who defined the perfect american male stealing the nations hearts
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a war bonds poster featuring a classical representation of a soldier and a Boy Scout, which is consistent with the text's mention of a war bonds poster. However, the text claims that both characters were modeled on Charles Beach by J.C. Leyendecker and implies that the artist, who was indeed a prominent figure in defining the American male image, used the same model for both characters. While J.C. Leyendecker did use his partner Charles Beach as a model for many of his illustrations, there is no clear evidence in the image that both characters were modeled after Charles Beach. The text also refers to Leyendecker as a "gay artist," which is a reference to his sexual orientation; this detail, while potentially true, is not verifiable in the image and is not relevant to the authenticity of the war bonds poster itself. The claim that both characters were modeled on Charles Beach seems to be an assumption rather than a fact that can be substantiated by the image alone. Therefore, the text contains potential misinformation regarding the specific modeling of the characters in the poster.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a Lululemon Athletica store, which is consistent with the text mentioning the company. There is no direct evidence in the image to suggest that the information about the company's charitable actions is false. The image complements the text by showing the storefront of the company in question. Without further context or evidence to the contrary, there is no reason to believe the text contains misinformation based solely on the image provided.
Text:
the most groundbreaking scientist youve never heard from anyone and i know why there arent more asians in the startup community and student representatives
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text makes a claim about a groundbreaking scientist that is supposedly not well-known, and it also addresses the representation of Asians in the startup community and among student representatives. The image provided shows an elderly person inside a car, looking out through the window. There is no clear connection between the text and the image. The image does not support the text in any way, nor does it provide evidence or context for the claims made in the text. Therefore, based on the inconsistency between the text and the image, it is likely that the post contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a robotic arm in an industrial setting, which is consistent with the description in the input text of a robot being used for rebar assembly. The environment looks like a workspace where such activities could take place, and the presence of rebar materials in the background supports the claim that the robot is involved in handling such materials. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
another failure facebook is scrambling to beef up security after discovering millions of users who falsely listed their education as school of hard knocks
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a Facebook profile with a user named "Joan Stanley" and does not provide any evidence of Facebook scrambling to beef up security or discovering millions of users who falsely listed their education as "School of Hard Knocks." The image simply shows a user profile with no indication of the issue mentioned in the text. Therefore, the image does not support the claim made in the text, suggesting that the post may contain misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a lamp with a base designed to look like a handgun, which is consistent with the input text's description of a bedroom nightstand lamp resembling a gun. The text implies that actual firearms are not easily accessible in Shanghai for those outside the military, and the lamp is presented as a novelty item that resembles a gun, which aligns with the text's message. There is no evident inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation.
Text:

Therefore, there is no misinformation present between the text and the image.
Text:
plastic microbeads can no longer be used in cosmetics and personal care products in the uk after a longpromised ban came into effect on tuesday the ban initially bars the manufacture of such products and a ban on sales will follow in
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a close-up of a finger with several blue plastic microbeads on it, which is consistent with the text that discusses the ban on plastic microbeads in cosmetics and personal care products. The presence of the logo from "The Guardian," a reputable news organization, suggests that the image is used to illustrate a news story about the ban. There is no evidence of inconsistency or misinformation based on the image and the text provided.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction: The image is a poster that matches the description provided in the input text. It shows a group of military personnel standing by flag-draped coffins with the phrase "Is this what you'd call 'PHASED WITHDRAWAL?'" prominently displayed, which suggests it is a critical commentary on a military policy, likely related to the withdrawal of troops. The text at the bottom cites "Clergy and Laymen Concerned," an organization that was indeed founded by antiwar clergy, including Martin Luther King Jr., during the Vietnam War era. The consistency between the text and the image indicates that there is no misinformation present in this post.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided is a cartoon character looking through a periscope, which is not consistent with the historical context described in the input text. The text refers to a real historical event involving Gunther Prien, a German U-boat commander, during World War II. The image, however, is from an animated television show and is not a depiction of a historical event or person. Therefore, the image does not support the text and indicates the presence of misinformation when considering the text and image as a combined post.
Text:
a postwar electoral poster saying that the communists have made the most sacrifices in the liberation from nazi germany and demanding a free and independent austria x late s
Label: 1
Prediction: The image appears to be a postwar electoral poster that matches the description given in the input text. It contains phrases in German that translate to "The communists have made the greatest sacrifices for the liberation" and "For a free and independent Austria," along with "Vote for the Communist Party of Austria." The visual elements, such as the flag and the outline of Austria, are consistent with the theme of national liberation and independence. There is no immediate evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
i woke up to this in my safari according to the search history i searched this in the early mornings i think i typed this sometime when i was either fully asleep or partially asleep
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a smartphone screen with a search engine displaying results for a nonsensical search query, "glow to ko go go asea kore 51 map." The search results include articles about Area 51, which is unrelated to the search query but is a known topic that might appear in searches due to its popularity. The text claims that the person woke up to find this search in their history and suggests they might have searched it while asleep or partially asleep. There is no clear misinformation present, as the text is a personal account that does not make any factual claims about the world, and the image is consistent with the text in showing a confused or accidental search query. The scenario described could be plausible, as people can indeed perform tasks such as typing while in a state of sleep or semi-consciousness, known as somnambulism or sleepwalking.
Text:
superman actor henry cavill sports his contractually obligated mustache which warner bros had to digitally remove during reshoots for the film justice league
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not show Henry Cavill, the actor known for playing Superman, but instead shows a different person with a mustache. Therefore, the image does not support the text, which claims that it is showing Henry Cavill with a mustache that had to be digitally removed for the film "Justice League." This inconsistency suggests that there is misinformation present in the post.
Text:
the new algorithm was designed to keep brendan fraser as george of the s flour manufacturers saw women turning their flour in pretty patterns
Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text seems to be nonsensical and contains a mixture of unrelated topics. It mentions a new algorithm designed to keep Brendan Fraser as George of the Jungle, which is a reference to a movie character, and then abruptly switches to talking about flour manufacturers and women turning flour into pretty patterns. This text does not present a coherent statement and appears to be a random combination of phrases.
The image provided is a scene from the television show "The Office," which has no connection to Brendan Fraser, algorithms, or flour manufacturers. The content of the text does not match the image, and the text itself is illogical, which indicates that the post containing this text and image likely contains misinformation.
Text:
bangladesh to remove the word virgin from muslim marriage certificates verdict from countrys top court will see virgin replaced with unmarried on in landmark victory for campaigners
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a group of people, presumably in Bangladesh, gathered in what appears to be a mosque, which is a place relevant to the Muslim community. The presence of the logo of "The Guardian," a reputable news organization, suggests that the image is likely from a news article. The text states that Bangladesh's top court has ruled to replace the word "virgin" with "unmarried" on Muslim marriage certificates, which is a decision that would be relevant to the Muslim community depicted in the image. There is no clear inconsistency between the text and the image that would indicate misinformation. However, without additional context or the ability to verify the current status of marriage certificates in Bangladesh, the final determination of misinformation cannot be made solely based on the image and text provided.
Text:
a cancer patient received donor milk for her daughter while going through treatments and is trying to raise awareness of donor milk for mothers going through treatments like hers
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows two women, each holding a baby, and they appear to be happy and healthy. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text. The text talks about a cancer patient who received donor milk for her daughter and is raising awareness about donor milk. The image could be interpreted as supportive of the text, potentially showing two mothers, one of whom might have received donor milk for her child. Since there is no clear evidence of misinformation in the image with respect to the text, we cannot conclude that there is misinformation present.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text is incoherent and does not form a logical statement or claim that can be fact-checked or verified against the image provided. It appears to be a random collection of phrases without a clear connection or context. The image shows a person with a concerned or distressed expression, which does not provide any evidence or contradiction to the text, mainly because the text itself is nonsensical. Therefore, the post is likely to contain misinformation due to the nonsensical and incoherent nature of the text.
Text:
this can of soda was under so much pressure that when i opened it there was a sound like a gun went off and the tab of aluminum that usually is pushed into the can was is instead like this
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a soda can with the tab opened in an unusual manner, which is consistent with the description provided in the input text. The tab appears to be pushed upwards rather than into the can, which could happen if the can was under a lot of pressure and the tab was forced outwards when opened. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
paradise saved some of worlds rarest birds rebound on pacific islands cleared of invasive predators five remote pacific islands are once again safe havens for four of our worlds rarest bird species following the success of one of the most ambitious island restoration projects ever implemented
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a bird that appears to be in a natural habitat, which could be consistent with the text's claim about rare birds rebounding on Pacific islands that have been cleared of invasive predators. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text, and the image of a bird in a natural setting could be seen as supporting evidence for the text's claim. Without additional context or expertise in bird species and conservation projects, it is not possible to definitively determine the accuracy of the text, but based on the information provided, there is no clear indication of misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image is a political cartoon by Will Dyson that depicts the leaders mentioned in the input text: David Lloyd George, Vittorio Emanuele Orlando, Georges Clemenceau, and Woodrow Wilson, in a manner consistent with the description provided. The cartoon is titled "Peace and Future Cannon Fodder," which matches the text, and it shows the leaders leaving what appears to be the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, as indicated by the text. The cartoon is a commentary on the outcome of the treaty, suggesting that the decisions made could lead to future conflicts, which is a subjective interpretation rather than misinformation. The image and the text are consistent with each other and with historical context.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows the Vivaldi web browser with Ecosia set as the search engine, which is consistent with the claim made in the input text. The counter indicating the number of trees planted suggests that Ecosia is indeed involved in tree planting activities, supporting the text's statement about Ecosia's donations to reforestation projects. There is no evident inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation.
Text:
lowercase stop sign in my area didnt think these were real until i saw one irl previously posted in another subreddit and someone pointed out this belongs here
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a stop sign with the word "stop" written in lowercase letters, which is inconsistent with the standard design of stop signs in many countries, including the United States, where stop signs typically feature the word "STOP" in uppercase letters. This inconsistency suggests that the image may have been altered or the sign may not be an official traffic sign, leading to the conclusion that the post could contain misinformation.
Text:
a real and rare footage of the execution of soviet partisans by a nazi firing squad for undermining german troops and significantly hampering their operations in the region of the vitsyebsk gate through means of skirmishes
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided is an animated character from a cartoon or anime series, which is inconsistent with the serious and historical nature of the input text. The text describes a real and rare footage of the execution of Soviet partisans by a Nazi firing squad, which would be a historical photograph or film, not an animated image. Therefore, the image does not support the text and indicates the presence of misinformation.
Text:
an art installation for international womens day had hanging currency with womens faces on it arranged in a way so if you view from one side it says pays and if you view on the other side it says change
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows an art installation with currency notes hanging from the ceiling, and the arrangement of the notes spells out "PAYS" when viewed from one angle and "CHANGE" when viewed from another angle. This matches the description provided in the input text, indicating that there is no misinformation present between the text and the image.
Text:
does anyone remember when all the secret space programs and release all the corrupt major news networks that mislead and censor antizionist criticism
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text makes a claim about secret space programs and corrupt major news networks related to censorship and antizionist criticism, which is a complex and controversial topic that would require substantial evidence to support. The image provided shows a firearm, a magazine, a handgun, and what appears to be a grenade. There is no clear connection between the image and the text. The image does not complement or provide evidence for the claims made in the text about space programs or news networks. Therefore, the inconsistency between the text and the image suggests that this post may contain misinformation.
Text:
national socialist nazi germans gas hundreds of jewish families that had been living in poland for generations in disinfection gas chambers video footage recovered from polish silesia restored
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not correspond to the serious and historical nature of the input text. The text discusses the tragic events of the Holocaust, specifically mentioning the use of gas chambers by Nazi Germans against Jewish families in Poland. However, the image shows a whimsical, animated character that appears to be a stylized ant or insect with human-like features, wearing a hard hat and holding a flag. This image is not appropriate evidence for the text and does not support the historical event described. Therefore, the post contains misinformation due to the inconsistency between the text and the image.
Text:
damning reveal trumps former doctor has admitted that the president ghostwrote his glowing account of adventuring through trumps body in a microscopic submarine
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that Trump's former doctor admitted the president ghostwrote a report about a journey through his body in a microscopic submarine. This statement is a clear example of misinformation as it describes an impossible scenario that is more akin to a fictional or satirical story rather than a factual report. The image provided does not validate the claim in any way, as it simply shows a person on a city street and does not provide any evidence related to the claim about a microscopic submarine adventure.
Text:
my dad pilot in vietnam in didnt know this photo existed until i came across it randomly on the internet he cried when he saw it hope this is the right place to post it
Label: 1
Prediction: The image shows a toy airplane with the word "WWWIIIST" on its wings, surrounded by small toy soldiers. This does not align with the input text, which mentions a personal story about the user's father being a pilot in Vietnam. The toy plane and soldiers are not appropriate evidence or complement to a story about a real person's experience in the Vietnam War. Therefore, the inconsistency suggests that this post may contain misinformation.
Text:
questions if you look closely in the scene where elisa makes love to the amphibian man you can see the virgin mary sitting on the toilet smiling in approval questions with guillermo del toro
Label: 1
Prediction: The image shows Guillermo del Toro with a background that appears to be related to his film involving an amphibian creature, which could be from "The Shape of Water." However, the claim that the Virgin Mary is depicted sitting on the toilet smiling in approval during a love scene in the film is highly unlikely and not consistent with the known content of the movie or Del Toro's filmmaking style. This description seems to be fabricated or satirical, as it does not align with any known scene from the film. Therefore, the text likely contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows three individuals who appear to be in a positive, affectionate gathering, which is consistent with the narrative of gratitude and overcoming adversity mentioned in the text. The woman in the center is likely Sarahjane Bradford, and the other two individuals could be some of the people who helped her. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text, so there is no clear indication of misinformation based on the image-text consistency.
Text:
years later the lakers would score as a name for cystic fibrosis because it is definitely the russo brothers and the one reason we know that is likely to spark anger in the news for the poor
Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text is nonsensical and contains a series of unrelated phrases. It mentions the Lakers, which is a basketball team, in the context of cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder, and then references the Russo brothers, who are film directors, followed by a vague statement about sparking anger in the news. The image shows a building with the logo of The Guardian, a reputable news organization, and a label indicating the image is from 2017. There is no clear connection between the text and the image, and the text itself is incoherent and does not present a logical statement or claim that can be fact-checked or supported by the image. Therefore, the post is likely to contain misinformation due to the nonsensical and unrelated nature of the text.
Text:
for a period in the s hitler was forbidden to address public meetings in much of germany which was a major blow to the nazi apparatus he alone of two billion people on earth not speak in germany
Label: 1
Prediction: The text claims that Hitler was "alone of two billion people on earth not [allowed to] speak in Germany," which is an exaggeration and misinformation. While it is true that Hitler faced speaking bans in the early 1920s, the claim that he was the only person among two billion not allowed to speak is false and misleading. There were certainly other individuals and groups facing restrictions or censorship in Germany and around the world at that time. The image shows a propaganda poster with Hitler's face and the word "REDEVERBOT" (speaking ban) across his mouth, which supports the historical fact that he faced a speaking ban, but it does not validate the exaggerated claim made in the text.
Text:
visitors to palau are being made to sign a promise to respect the environment in an innovative move that authorities hope will curb ecological damage caused by booming numbers of tourists palau pledge is stamped onto visitors passports and must be signed upon arrival in the country
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a person in a beach environment, which is consistent with the type of location one might expect to find in Palau, known for its beautiful islands and marine biodiversity. The person is wearing a full-body swimsuit, which could be indicative of a visitor taking precautions to respect the environment, possibly by avoiding sunscreens that can harm coral reefs. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text about visitors to Palau being required to sign an environmental pledge. Therefore, there is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided.
Text:
though she knows shes the real source of calcium she doesnt mind that mr skeltal gets the glory because she knows that happiness comes from within
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text appears to be a whimsical or metaphorical statement rather than a factual claim, as it personifies a non-human entity ("she") as being a source of calcium and refers to "Mr. Skeltal," which is likely a playful or fictional character reference. The image shows a hand holding a small carton of low-fat milk, which is a known source of calcium. The text and image are inconsistent because the text does not directly refer to milk as the source of calcium but rather to a personified entity. However, the inconsistency here does not necessarily indicate misinformation but rather a lack of clarity or a metaphorical expression. The text seems to be making a philosophical statement about recognition and self-contentment rather than a factual claim about calcium sources. Therefore, while the text and image are not aligned, this does not constitute misinformation in the traditional sense of false or misleading information.
Text:
peter wang a yearold member of the junior rotc who was killed as he tried to help fellow students escape a mass shooting in parkland posthumously admitted to the us military academy wang and two other cadets martin duque and alaina petty both were also awarded the medal of heroism
Label: 0
Prediction:
The text and the image appear to be consistent with each other. The image shows a memorial display with a photograph of Peter Wang, and the text refers to a person named Peter Wang who was a victim of a mass shooting. The dates on the image (2003-2018) correspond to a 15-year-old individual, which aligns with the text stating Peter Wang was a "yearold" (presumably meant to be "15-year-old"). The text also mentions a posthumous admission to the US Military Academy and an award of the Medal of Heroism, which are honors that could be consistent with the context of the image showing a memorial for someone who has passed away under heroic circumstances. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the provided text and image.
Text:
another pic of the frozen window at the car wash i worked at in college it was fahrenheit and yes my boss was making me was cars in that weather
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a window with frost patterns, which is consistent with the description in the input text of a "frozen window at the car wash." Frost patterns like these are typically formed on windows when there is a significant difference between indoor and outdoor temperatures, often in extremely cold conditions. The text claims that the temperature was -17 degrees Fahrenheit, which is plausible for such frost to occur. There is no direct evidence in the image to contradict the text, and the image does appear to support the claim of very cold weather conditions. Therefore, there is no indication of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
wife of a high ranking nazi officer making her last salute to hitler and drinking poison to join her husband in valhalla who died in battle as the red army swiftly takes berlin
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image does not support the text provided. The image shows a modern scene with a person holding up what appears to be a flag or a banner, looking out over a large crowd of people in a contemporary urban setting. The architecture and the clothing of the people suggest that this is a recent photograph, not one from the World War II era when the Red Army was taking Berlin. Additionally, the concept of "Valhalla" is from Norse mythology and would not typically be associated with the beliefs of Nazi officers. Therefore, the image does not corroborate the historical event described in the text, indicating that the post contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows an elderly woman who appears to be in a celebratory setting, possibly related to a birthday given the presence of what looks like a cake in front of her. She is holding a microphone, suggesting she might be giving a speech or being honored in some way. The text mentions that "auntie ida" celebrated her 110th birthday and has lived through significant historical events. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the claims made in the text. The woman in the image could plausibly be of an age to have lived through the mentioned events, and the setting is consistent with a celebration that could be for a significant birthday. Therefore, there is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a giant tortoise, which is consistent with the text that talks about "Lonesome George," a giant tortoise. The text states that DNA evidence suggests that more of his species might still exist, which is a claim that could be supported by scientific evidence and is not inherently contradicted by the image. Without additional context or evidence to the contrary, there is no clear indication of misinformation based solely on the image and the text provided.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided is a cartoon featuring characters that resemble Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, which are fictional characters from the Disney franchise. The text in the image is informal and does not align with the formal context of a political disagreement between a Secretary of State and a President. The image does not provide any evidence or complement the seriousness of the input text regarding a political issue. Therefore, the inconsistency between the text and the image suggests that this post contains misinformation.
Text:
this is the middle of winter in canterbury nz i know its hard to imagine because the southern hemisphere doesnt usually freeze this way this had been a very cold winter btw we have glaciers here lol
Label: 0
Prediction: The text states that it is the middle of winter in Canterbury, New Zealand, and mentions unusually cold weather and the presence of glaciers. The image shows a snowy landscape, which is consistent with the description of a very cold winter. While it is less common for the Southern Hemisphere to experience extreme cold compared to the Northern Hemisphere, it is not impossible, especially in areas close to the poles or at high altitudes. Canterbury, NZ, does experience winter snow, especially in the higher regions, and the country does have glaciers. Therefore, there is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image appears to show a news report featuring a man with the caption "Saving the Anim" from a location called "Safari West - Santa Rosa." The context of the image seems to align with the input text, which describes a man staying behind to save animals from a wildfire. The image supports the text by showing what looks like a news segment covering the story, and there is no immediate evidence of inconsistency or manipulation that would suggest misinformation.
Text:
parent of the year when his daughter got her first period this super dad shit his pants and explained its pretty much the closest he can get to that
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text makes a claim about a father's reaction to his daughter's first period that is highly unusual and not socially normative. It suggests that the father defecated in his pants to empathize with his daughter's experience. The image shows a man and a young girl, presumably a father and daughter, smiling and posing for a photo. There is nothing in the image that corroborates the unusual claim made in the text. The image appears to be a normal, wholesome photo of a father and daughter, with no indication of the context described in the text. Therefore, the inconsistency between the text and the image suggests that the post may contain misinformation.
Text:

Prediction:
The image appears to be a poster with the phrase "UNITY IS THE SOLUTION" prominently displayed in the center, which is consistent with the input text. The poster also includes the phrase "FROM THE PRISONERS OF ATTICA STATE PRISON: TO ALL OPPRESSED PEOPLE OF THE WORLD," which aligns with the mention of "prisoners of attica state prison" and "all oppressed people of the world" in the input text. Additionally, the bottom of the poster references the "Student Research Facility Berkeley CA Mid S," which corresponds to the latter part of the input text. The visual elements of the poster, such as the symbols and phrases around the central message, support the theme of unity and solidarity among various groups, which does not contradict the input text. Therefore, there is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not show a decapitated Russian POW or any evidence related to the Dagestan massacre. Instead, it depicts a broken plastic bottle on the ground, which has no relevance to the text describing a gruesome war scene. The inconsistency between the text and the image suggests that this post may contain misinformation.

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a person holding what appears to be a marriage license or certificate with a visible heart symbol, which could be interpreted as a sign of support for marriage, including same-sex marriage. This visual evidence does not contradict the input text, which states that a Republican clerk in Bexar County, Texas, is set to greet same-sex couples and suggests a welcoming attitude. There is no clear indication of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.

ahmadinejad says enemies destroy irans rain clouds the iranian president has accused his countrys enemies of enacting a sinister plan to create a drought by somehow destroying the rain clouds before they reach iran
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided does not offer any evidence or context that would support or refute the claim made in the input text. It is simply a placeholder or loading image from the Reuters news agency, which does not provide any information regarding the Iranian president's claim about enemies destroying Iran's rain clouds. Without additional context or evidence, we cannot verify the claim, and the image does not contribute to the credibility of the statement. Therefore, the post could potentially contain misinformation due to the lack of supporting evidence in the image.

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a large number of chickens in a confined space, which is consistent with the concept of factory farming. The text mentions a vote on banning factory farming in Switzerland, and the image complements the text by providing a visual example of what factory farming can look like. There is no clear inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation.
Text:
bought the soundtrack for a space odyssey the other week while in philly just noticed today theres also a copy of the worlds favorite tchaikovsky in there performed by the philadelphia orchestra
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a vinyl record with a label that indicates it is from the soundtrack of "2001: A Space Odyssey," which is consistent with the text. The album cover visible in the background also corresponds to the "2001: A Space Odyssey" soundtrack. There is no visible evidence in the image to suggest that it contains Tchaikovsky's work performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra, but the text claims that there is also a copy of Tchaikovsky's work included, which is not necessarily contradicted by the image. It is possible that the Tchaikovsky record is not visible in the image provided. Therefore, there is no clear inconsistency between the text and the image that would indicate misinformation.
Text:
irish industries infernal machine manufacturing irish vote manufacturing the landlordkilling industry begging a neverfailing irish industry england
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image appears to be a satirical cartoon from a historical period, depicting various "Irish industries" in a negative light. The text accompanying the image is a string of phrases that seem to be taken from the captions of the cartoon, which include "infernal machine manufacturing," "Irish vote manufacturing," "the landlord-killing industry," and "begging a never-failing Irish industry." The cartoon is likely from a time when there were tensions between the Irish and the English, and such images were used to propagate stereotypes and negative sentiments.
The image and the text together seem to be pushing a narrative that portrays Irish people in a derogatory manner, suggesting that they are involved in nefarious or lowly activities. This kind of content could be considered misinformation because it generalizes and misrepresents an entire group of people based on stereotypes and prejudice, rather than providing factual information about actual industries or activities. It's important to note that historical context is crucial here, and the image is likely from a time when such depictions were used for political or social commentary, which may not reflect the truth of the situation.

Prediction:
The image shows a silhouette of a soldier with an overlay of words that relate to struggle and mental health issues, which is consistent with the theme of veteran suicide awareness mentioned in the input text. There is no clear discrepancy between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. The image complements the text by visually representing the mental health challenges that veterans may face, which is relevant to an event aimed at raising awareness about veteran suicide.
Text:
raiders of the lost barks the agency that accounts for missing american servicemen the crack military unit whose quarry is not foreign enemies but longdead soldiers
Label: 0
Prediction:
The text describes an agency responsible for accounting for missing American servicemen, suggesting a military unit that searches for the remains of soldiers who have died, rather than active combat with foreign enemies. The image shows a facility with the POW/MIA logo, which stands for "Prisoner of War/Missing in Action," and appears to be a lab where remains are being processed or analyzed. The presence of military personnel and the lab setting with skeletal remains are consistent with the text's description of an agency that deals with long-dead soldiers. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a person holding a very small clementine-like fruit with a peeled larger clementine in the background. The small fruit appears to have a rind and resembles a normal clementine but in miniature form, which is consistent with the description provided in the input text. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction: The image shows a person who appears to have been suddenly awakened, which is consistent with the description of a "hypnic jerk" in the input text. A hypnic jerk, also known as a hypnagogic jerk, is a common involuntary muscle spasm that occurs as people fall asleep. The text's claim that scientists think it's the brain thinking the body is dying is a simplification and not entirely accurate, but it does reflect one of the hypotheses about why hypnic jerks occur. The image does not provide evidence of misinformation, as it visually represents the concept described in the text.
Text:
phone was laying on the blanket and randomly started listening to my convo when i swiped it up to turn it off there was this creepy imprint left behind
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a blanket with an imprint that resembles the shape of a phone. However, the claim that the phone was "listening to a conversation" and that this action resulted in a "creepy imprint" when the phone was swiped up to be turned off is not supported by the image. The image only shows an imprint on a blanket, which could be made by pressing any similarly shaped object into the fabric. There is no evidence in the image that supports the phone's alleged eavesdropping or that the action of swiping the phone to turn it off would cause such a detailed imprint. The text makes a claim that is not verifiable by the image and suggests a cause-and-effect (phone listening and imprint creation) that is not scientifically plausible, indicating misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a person sitting at a table with food, which could be in a restaurant. The person appears to be smiling and there is food on the table, suggesting that they may have been served a meal. This visual evidence does not contradict the text, which states that restaurants in a small eastern Anatolian town offer free meals to those in need. There is no clear indication of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text states that the album is real but the covers are not, which implies that the image is meant to be a fictional or conceptual draft cover for an album. The image provided appears to be an album cover design, which is consistent with the claim made in the text. There is no direct evidence of misinformation based on the text and the image provided.
Text:
tank man temporarily stops the advance of a column of tanks on in beijing in what is widely considered one of the most iconic images of the th century
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided is a computer-generated image (CGI) or a digital illustration, not a photograph. The "Tank Man" incident is a historical event that was captured in a series of photographs and videos showing a real person standing in front of tanks. The image here does not depict the actual event or a real person, but rather a stylized or artistic representation of the event. Therefore, the image does not serve as evidence for the text, which describes a real historical event, and thus contains misinformation when presented as such.
Text:
a young donald trump signing in his jazz band before becoming a property developer with ceelo green on the drums and martin short on the piano plasticised
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a caricatured representation of a band with figures resembling Donald Trump, CeeLo Green, and Martin Short. However, the claim that this depicts an actual event where Donald Trump was signing in a jazz band with CeeLo Green on drums and Martin Short on piano is not credible. The figures are stylized and exaggerated, which is typical for artistic representations rather than real-life photographs. Additionally, the term "plasticised" suggests that the figures might be made of plastic or a similar material, indicating that this is likely a display or a themed decoration rather than a depiction of a real event. Therefore, the text contains misinformation as it inaccurately describes the content of the image.
Text:
yeah im a great quitter its one of the few things i do well i come from a long line of quitters my father was a quitter my grandfather was a quitter i was raised to give up
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text appears to be a self-deprecating statement about the speaker's tendency to quit, possibly meant humorously. The image shows a group of people looking at a painting or photograph of a person in a pose that is reminiscent of classical art. There is no direct correlation between the text and the image that would indicate misinformation. The text does not make any factual claims that could be supported or contradicted by the image. Therefore, based on the information provided, there is no evidence of misinformation.
Text:
the uks astonishing coal free run continues two weeks and counting the worlds fifth largest economy has not switched on its coal plants since th of
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a coal power plant with smoke coming out of its stacks, which contradicts the claim in the input text that the UK has not switched on its coal plants for two weeks. The presence of smoke suggests that the plant is operational, thus indicating that the text may contain misinformation. Additionally, the BBC News logo in the image implies that it is a reputable source, which could lend credibility to the image, but without a date or further context, it's not possible to definitively determine the time frame the image refers to. Therefore, based on the available information, there is a suggestion of misinformation due to the inconsistency between the text and the image.
Text:
in recognition of the states two official languages the university of hawaiis campuses will begin issuing their graduates two diplomasone in english and one in hawaiianduring the academic year
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a diploma cover with the "University of Hawaii" seal on it, which is consistent with the text stating that the University of Hawaii's campuses will issue diplomas. The presence of a plumeria flower, which is commonly associated with Hawaiian culture, and the tassel, which is typical for graduation caps and diplomas, support the context of graduation in Hawaii. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the claim made in the text about the university issuing diplomas in both English and Hawaiian. Without further evidence to the contrary, we cannot assume misinformation based on the image and text provided.
Text:
houston tx lawyer says video shows police officer caused confrontation with social worker earledreka white was handcuffed and arrested while talking to a dispatcher asking for police backup for the traffic stop the video shows
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided is a still from a surveillance camera showing a parking lot with several cars and a timestamp. The image does not show any confrontation or interaction between a police officer and a social worker, nor does it show anyone being handcuffed or arrested. The text claims that there is a video showing a confrontation and an arrest, but the image does not support this claim. Therefore, there is a discrepancy between the text and the image, which suggests that the post may contain misinformation. However, without additional context or evidence, it is not possible to definitively determine the accuracy of the text based on the image alone.
Text:
uk house of commons could replace benches with folddown seats to improve access for disabled mps commons clerk david natzler offered support for plan for several tip up seats in the house and acknowledged formidable challenges to disability access in parliament
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows the exterior of the UK Houses of Parliament, which is consistent with the topic of the input text discussing the UK House of Commons. However, the image does not provide any specific evidence to confirm or refute the claim about replacing benches with fold-down seats to improve access for disabled MPs. Since there is no direct contradiction or evidence of misinformation in the image regarding the text, we cannot conclude that the post contains misinformation based solely on the image provided. The text itself appears to be a plausible statement about potential changes to accommodate disabled MPs in the House of Commons.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a group of children in what appears to be a classroom setting, with an adult reading to them. This is consistent with the text, which mentions an early childhood education program. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the information in the text about the John and Laura Arnold Foundation pledging money to keep the program going during a shutdown. Without additional context or evidence to suggest otherwise, there is no clear indication of misinformation based on the image and text provided.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a bubble tea cup with a graphic that includes a figure performing a kick and the word "recyclable" alongside a recycling bin symbol. This matches the description provided in the input text, which states that the cup from Kung Fu Tea has an image of a guy crane kicking his tea into a recycling bin to inform that the cups are recyclable. There is consistency between the text and the image, and there is no indication of misinformation based on the provided content.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows Leonardo DiCaprio, who is known for his environmental activism and philanthropy. The text claims that Leonardo DiCaprio's Earth Alliance has committed funds to help the Amazon fires, which is consistent with his public stance on environmental issues. There is no direct evidence in the image to contradict the claim made in the text, and the information provided is plausible and aligns with DiCaprio's known activities. Therefore, there is no clear indication of misinformation based solely on the image and the text provided. However, without additional verification of the specific claim about the donation, a definitive conclusion cannot be made.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a sign that reads "Welcome to HMP Brixton" with the BBC News logo, which suggests that it is a news report about Her Majesty's Prison Brixton. The text talks about UK's prison restaurants called "The Clink" that are open to the public and staffed by inmates, which is a real initiative known to take place in some UK prisons, including HMP Brixton. The claim about reoffending rates dropping for inmates working in these restaurants is a claim that can be verified with data, and the image does not contradict this information. Therefore, there is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided. However, without specific reoffending rate figures mentioned in the text, it is not possible to fully verify the accuracy of the claim.
Text:
my wife got the glasses because our toddler kept tearing them off her face and breaking her other ones they are meant for construction workers
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a pair of glasses with one of the arms detached, which is consistent with the input text's claim that the glasses were purchased because their toddler kept tearing them off and breaking them. The glasses appear to be durable, possibly designed for rough use, as the text suggests they are meant for construction workers. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Prediction:
The image shows a group of women in a laboratory setting, which is consistent with the text mentioning a database for "ask a woman scientist." The image supports the text's message by depicting women scientists, which aligns with the goal of representing the diversity of scientists. There is no clear indication of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
heavily spotted owls are the only digit not enclosed in the middle east but imported to new zealand along with a high density of capillaries in their nests and explore nearby branches after only six
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text mentions "heavily spotted owls," which is inconsistent with the image provided. The image shows what appears to be a young kangaroo or wallaby wrapped in a blanket, not an owl. Additionally, the text contains several incoherent phrases, such as "the only digit not enclosed in the middle east," which does not make sense. The claim about owls being imported to New Zealand and having a high density of capillaries in their nests is also questionable and not supported by the image. Therefore, the post contains misinformation due to the inconsistency between the text and the image, as well as the nonsensical and potentially false statements within the text.
Text:
i used to work at starbucks and this coffee sleeve was inside an unopened box of sleeves as in someone that worked in the factory where these were packed must have placed this sticker over top of the regular logo this was the only one i found any thoughts
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a Starbucks coffee sleeve with the Starbucks logo visible. The claim that the logo is covered by a sticker does not align with the visual evidence provided by the image. The logo appears to be printed directly on the sleeve, with no evidence of a sticker overlay. Therefore, the text's claim about a sticker being placed over the logo is inconsistent with the image, suggesting misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image supports the text provided. It shows a mother holding a baby on a plane, which aligns with the mention of a mother and her baby in the text. Additionally, the image shows a close-up of a bag containing candy and what appears to be earplugs, along with a note explaining the contents, which corroborates the text's claim that the mother handed out bags of candy and earplugs to fellow passengers. There is no indication of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
every colombian citizen must vote whoever doesnt use that right or doesnt fulfil that duty or is not a republican or belongs to the other sex early th century
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text and the image present a message that suggests every Colombian citizen must vote and that failing to do so, not being a republican, or belonging to another sex is against one's duty. This message appears to be from the early 20th century, which aligns with the style of the image. However, the statement about the requirement to vote and the exclusion based on political affiliation or sex is historically inaccurate and promotes misinformation. During the early 20th century, many countries, including Colombia, did not allow women to vote, and voting was not compulsory for all citizens. Additionally, the exclusion of non-republicans from voting would be undemocratic and not representative of a fair electoral system. Therefore, the post contains misinformation regarding historical voting rights and requirements in Colombia.
Text:
when someone asks you to make lemonade you can either give them lemonade or invite some friends over for a lemon party nsfw but not quite that nsfw
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not correspond appropriately to the text. The text suggests a play on words, hinting at a "lemon party" which could be a reference to a social gathering involving lemonade or a play on the term for an adult-themed gathering, but it also suggests that it's "not quite that nsfw." The image, however, shows a group of men in a pool, and it has been altered with additional elements that are not related to making lemonade or a typical social gathering. The inconsistency between the text and the image, along with the altered elements in the image, suggests that the post may contain misinformation or be misleading.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a man who appears to be Emmanuel Macron, the President of France, which is consistent with the context of the Input Text discussing a French initiative. The initiative mentioned in the text, "Make Our Planet Great Again," is a real program that was launched by France, and it aligns with Macron's public stance on climate change and efforts to attract international researchers. Therefore, there is no direct evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Prediction:
The text describes a Danish poster by the political party Danish Assembly, and the image shows a poster with Danish text that translates to "All of South Jutland won" and "That is the goal of the struggle Danish Assembly." The image and the text are consistent with each other, both referring to a Danish political message, and there is no evidence of misinformation based on the provided content and image.

Prediction: The image shows a man with a comic book on a stick, seemingly reading out to someone who is not visible in the picture but could be a small child given the presence of what looks like a stroller. The setting appears to be a sidewalk, and the man is indeed presenting the comic book enthusiastically as described in the text. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
gerard depardieus lawyer has claimed that his prosecution for drink driving was illegal because the french actor was too drunk when he was told about it
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a person who appears to be Gerard Depardieu pouring a drink, which could be seen as supporting the claim that he has a connection with alcohol. However, the claim that his prosecution for drink driving was illegal because he was too drunk to be informed about it does not hold legal merit. Being too intoxicated to understand a notification of prosecution does not make the prosecution itself illegal. Therefore, the text seems to be spreading misinformation by suggesting that the legal process was not valid based on the actor's state of intoxication.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a young girl lying on the floor next to a cat, appearing to cuddle with it. This visual is consistent with the input text, which describes a person named Jade Allen cuddling with a cat named Trubs that she rescued from a shelter. The text mentions that Allen has a sensory processing disorder and bonded with Trubs, who had special needs and was considered almost unadoptable. The image supports the text by showing a close bond between the girl and the cat, which aligns with the story of adoption and companionship described. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text makes a series of claims that are not only unfounded and conspiratorial but also reference events and actions that are highly implausible. It suggests that Donald Trump strangled Jeffrey Epstein in his cell and mentions a "Vulcan nerve pinch," a fictional technique from the Star Trek universe, attributed to Bill Clinton. The image provided is a still from the Star Trek series, showing characters Captain Kirk and Lieutenant Uhura from the original series, and Captain Picard from The Next Generation series. The image is clearly from a science fiction television show and has no connection to the real-life individuals or events mentioned in the text. The combination of the text and the image indicates that the post is likely to contain misinformation.
Text:
four new dna letters double lifes alphabet scientists from florida have doubled this number of lifes building blocks creating for the first time a synthetic eightletter genetic language that seems to store and transcribe information just like natural dna
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided does not seem to be directly related to the text about synthetic DNA. The image appears to be an abstract or scientific illustration, possibly related to physics or chemistry, but it does not depict anything that would visually confirm or deny the creation of a synthetic eight-letter genetic language. Without visual evidence that correlates with the text, the image does not support the claim, and thus, it could be considered misinformation. However, it's important to note that the existence of synthetic DNA with an expanded genetic alphabet is a real scientific endeavor, but the image does not validate the specific claim made in the text.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows an elderly man who appears to be sitting alone, which is consistent with the narrative of a "lonely pensioner." There is no direct contradiction between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. The text claims that James Gray received many offers to spend Christmas with him after posting an advert, despite an initial lack of response and a cancellation. The image alone cannot confirm the number of responses he received, but it does not inherently contradict the text's claim. Therefore, based on the image and the text provided, there is no clear evidence of misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not support the text. The text claims to show a picture of an undercover CIA agent named Francis Delaware Jackson stationed in Chernobyl, but the image is of a dog wearing a hat with a Soviet symbol, in front of a Ferris wheel that is likely meant to represent the one in the abandoned city of Pripyat, near Chernobyl. The image is clearly not of a CIA agent and appears to be digitally altered or created for humorous or artistic purposes rather than as a genuine piece of evidence supporting the text's claim. Therefore, the post contains misinformation due to the inconsistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a cemetery with various gravestones, which is consistent with the context of burials mentioned in the text. However, the image alone does not provide any verifiable information regarding the financial status of West Virginia's funding for burials of indigent people who have died from drug overdoses. Without specific evidence such as official documents, budget reports, or credible news sources confirming the claim about the funding running out, the image cannot substantiate the claim made in the text. Therefore, based on the image alone, we cannot confirm or refute the text's claim, and it is not possible to determine if misinformation is present solely from the image and text provided.

Prediction: The image shows a person holding what appears to be paper and pulp trays outside of an Iceland store, which is consistent with the claim made in the input text that Iceland has committed to eliminating plastic packaging for all its own brand products within five years, replacing it with paper and pulp trays and paper bags. There is no evident inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation.

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text is a modified version of a speech from the movie "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," originally delivered by the character Aragorn. In the original speech, Aragorn addresses men, not frogs. The image shows a digitally manipulated scene with frogs wearing helmets and carrying spears, arranged as if they are an army, with two frogs in the foreground wearing more elaborate armor, suggesting a leadership or hero role. This image is clearly a work of fiction or satire, as frogs do not engage in human-like warfare, nor do they wear armor or carry flags. The combination of the altered text and the fantastical image indicates that this post is not meant to be taken as factual information but rather as a humorous or satirical piece, thus containing misinformation if interpreted as a genuine news report or factual statement.
Text:

The content of the text is a human interest story that is plausible and the type of content that "The Guardian" might cover. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text. Therefore, there is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and text provided.

Prediction:
The image shows a group of people in a meeting or conference setting, which does not provide any specific evidence to support or refute the claim made in the text about the racial composition and socioeconomic status of students in Florida public schools. Therefore, based on the image alone, there is no clear indication of misinformation. However, to accurately determine the presence of misinformation, one would need to consult the actual report mentioned or other reliable data sources. The image does not contradict the text, but it also does not confirm it.

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that James Corden will no longer have the kids from "Stranger Things" play "shirtless baby oil twister by candle light" on his show to discourage fans from sexualizing them. The image shows a neon sign with the words "Shirtless Baby Oil Twister by Candle Light" and a small inset picture of James Corden. The concept of having minors participate in such an activity on a television show is highly inappropriate and unlikely to be true. This scenario seems to be fabricated and sensational, likely intended as satire or a joke rather than a factual report. Therefore, the post contains misinformation.

The input text is incoherent and does not form a logical sentence or narrative. It appears to be a random collection of phrases and words that do not relate to each other in a meaningful way. The image provided is of a person, but without context, it is impossible to determine how this image relates to the text. The lack of coherence and context between the text and the image suggests that the post may contain misinformation or is nonsensical, as there is no clear message or evidence to support any claims made in the text.

Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text is incoherent and nonsensical, stringing together unrelated phrases without any logical connection or meaningful context. The image provided is a gif of a person, which does not correlate with the text in any discernible way. The lack of coherence and the absence of a clear relationship between the text and the image suggest that the post is not conveying reliable information. Therefore, it can be considered as containing misinformation due to its nonsensical nature.

Label: 1
Prediction: The image appears to be consistent with the description provided in the input text. The photo shows what looks like the inside of a cardboard tube with a light source at one end, resembling a lightbulb, and a small silhouette of a bird added to the scene. The text explains that the image was created by taking a picture through a paper towel roll and then adding a bird, suggesting that the bird is not originally part of the scene. Since the text openly acknowledges the manipulation, there is no intention to deceive, and therefore, no misinformation is present.

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided is a portrait of Bill Clinton, which is consistent with the mention of his name in the input text. The text appears to be a statement of support for Juan Guaidó and the people of Venezuela, which is a stance that Bill Clinton could conceivably take, given his political background and the international support Guaidó has received. There is no direct evidence in the image that contradicts the text, and without further context, there is no clear indication of misinformation based solely on the image and the text provided.

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text is incoherent and does not seem to relate to the image provided. It mentions being a sneaker head, a grandmother giving something twice, lying, taking responsibility, and taking kids from households due to tweeting. The image shows a woman at a podium with the White House logo, suggesting a formal setting likely related to government or politics. There is no clear connection between the text and the image, and the text itself is nonsensical and disjointed, which indicates that the post may contain misinformation or is at least not presenting information in a clear and truthful manner.

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image appears to be a historical poster with the text "Diese Schandtaten: Eure Schuld!" which translates to "These atrocities: Your fault!" in English. This is consistent with the input text, which describes it as a poster made by occupation forces in Germany after WWII to promote German collective guilt. The image shows a series of photographs that are likely to be related to the atrocities committed during the war, which would be in line with the kind of message the occupying forces might have wanted to convey to the German population at the time. There is no immediate evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the input text and the image.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows what appears to be military personnel inside an aircraft, dispersing leaflets over an area. This is consistent with the text's mention of "us military poster/leaflet/radio campaigns," suggesting that the image is being used to provide visual evidence of such operations. However, the claim that the journalists who wrote the article have been targeted by a psyop campaign to discredit them is a serious accusation that requires substantial evidence. The image does not provide any evidence of a psyop campaign targeting journalists, nor does it discredit the information about the US information operations programs. Therefore, without additional context or evidence to support the claim about the targeting of journalists, the post could contain misinformation.

Prediction: The image shows diabetes management supplies, including a blood glucose monitor, test strips, insulin pens, and a syringe, which are relevant to the topic of diabetes care mentioned in the input text. There is no clear inconsistency between the image and the text that would indicate misinformation. The text discusses the impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on health insurance coverage for diabetics, which is a plausible claim that can be verified through studies and data. The image complements the text by depicting items that diabetics use to manage their condition, which aligns with the context of improving health equity for those with diabetes through increased insurance coverage.

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a vehicle with passengers on a tour, likely in a natural setting that could be in Hawaii, given the vegetation and landscape. While the image does not directly confirm the grand opening of the 'Alohilani Resort Waikiki Beach or the partnership with the Hawaiian Legacy Reforestation Initiative, it also does not contradict the information provided in the text. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided. The image could be seen as generally supportive of the text's message about environmental commitment, as it depicts a natural setting that might benefit from tree planting initiatives.

It appears to be sourced from a reputable organization (The Economist) and is consistent with the input text, which discusses the disparity between bosses' and workers' pay.

There is no clear indication of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
the young japanese man caught by two guards and executing by electrocution after the pearl harbor attackhe was accuses of being spy after the irregular trial he sentence to death in
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not show a scene of an execution by electrocution. It appears to be a black and white photograph of a person who is being held by two other individuals. The person in the middle is making an expressive face, but there is no evidence of an execution taking place, such as an electric chair or other execution equipment. The image does not match the severity of the claim made in the text, and there is no historical record of a Japanese man being executed by electrocution immediately after the Pearl Harbor attack for being a spy. Therefore, the post contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a landscape that could be consistent with the Arctic region, featuring what appears to be a frozen river and a snowy, barren landscape. This type of imagery is often used to depict the Arctic environment. The text discusses a research paper that brings together various indicators of the Arctic's climate and suggests that the findings are troubling for global climate stability. There is no clear inconsistency between the text and the image that would indicate misinformation. The image supports the text's message about concerns regarding the Arctic and its impact on global climate. However, without specific details from the research paper or additional context, it's not possible to definitively assess the accuracy of the text's claims.

Prediction:
The text describes a phenomenon that occurs in northern regions above the Arctic Circle, where the sun does not rise for a period during the winter, known as the polar night. The image shows a group of people gathered on a snowy landscape witnessing the sunrise, which is consistent with the text's description of people experiencing the year's first sunlight after a period of darkness. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a group of people, presumably staff from the Orange County District Attorney's office, posing with several dogs in front of a building labeled "OFFICE OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY." The presence of the dogs in the image is consistent with the Input Text's claim about a program using therapy dogs to comfort young sexual assault victims. There is no evident inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation.

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows the storefront of the "Flatwoods Monster Museum," which corresponds with the input text stating that there is a museum in Sutton, WV dedicated to the Flatwoods monster. The text describes the museum as interesting and suggests it is worth visiting if one is in the area. The image provides visual confirmation of the museum's existence and its theme, which is consistent with the text. Therefore, there is no indication of misinformation based on the image and the text provided.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction: The image is consistent with the input text. It is a historical political cartoon from Harper's Weekly, titled "The American River Ganges," which metaphorically depicts Catholic clergy as crocodiles invading America's shore, threatening the nation's schoolchildren. This reflects the anti-Catholic sentiment of the time and is an example of the type of imagery used in political cartoons to convey a message or critique. There is no misinformation present as the image aligns with the description provided in the input text.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a poster with the phrase "UNITED WE WIN" and depicts an African American and a white man working together on what appears to be a military airplane part, with an American flag in the background. This image is consistent with the input text, which states that the US government launched campaigns to counter the demoralizing effect of racial segregation by highlighting the contributions of African Americans to the war effort. The poster is an example of such a campaign, promoting unity and the combined effort of Americans of different races during wartime. Therefore, there is no misinformation detected between the text and the image.

Text:
if a man does not have knowledge of himself and his position in society and the world then he has little chance to relate to anything else usa s
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image appears to be a historical photograph or poster related to a social or political movement, possibly from the 1960s or 1970s, judging by the style of clothing and the design. It features two individuals, one holding a rifle and the other holding a book, which suggests a message about education and self-defense or militancy. The text on the image is not fully legible, but it seems to be related to the empowerment of a group of people.
The input text speaks to the importance of self-knowledge and understanding one's position in society and the world, implying that without this knowledge, a person cannot connect with broader issues.
There is no direct contradiction between the text and the image, but the image does not provide clear evidence to support the text. The text is a general statement about self-awareness and its importance in relating to the world, while the image seems to be more specific to a historical context or movement. Without additional context to link the image and the text, it is difficult to determine if the image complements the text in a way that would be considered misinformation.
However, given the task's requirement to assess consistency between the text and the image, and considering that the image does not clearly support the text's message, it is possible that the post could be misleading or using the image in a way that does not accurately represent the text's intent. Therefore, I have indicated that misinformation may exist.
Text:
these are the lists of ancestors i have and the index of the records of such people they are pages long and they dont even include ancestors before mandatory records in my country
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided is of low quality and the text on the pages is pixelated and unreadable. This makes it impossible to verify the claim that these are lists of ancestors or indexes of records. The lack of verifiable information in the image means that it does not substantiate the text, which could indicate the presence of misinformation. However, without further context or evidence, it is not possible to definitively determine the accuracy of the text based on the image alone.
Text:
fu great britain a ford in britain pumps out more toxic fumes than a ford back home in america greenpeace poster that played a role in changing british fuel emissions standards x more in comments
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a license plate with the text "F-U-GB" and a claim that a Ford in Britain emits 100% more toxic fumes than a Ford in America, attributed to Greenpeace. The image appears to be a mock-up or a conceptual representation rather than actual evidence of emission levels. The use of a license plate to convey this message seems to be a creative design choice for an advertisement or a campaign poster rather than a factual presentation of data. Without verifiable data or sources to back up the claim, the image does not provide credible evidence to support the text's assertion. Therefore, the post could contain misinformation due to the lack of substantiation for the claim made in the text and the image.
Text:

The text also mentions that the ink has been bleached by the sun above the fold, and the image indeed shows a piece of paper with faded writing in the upper section, which aligns with the sun bleaching the ink as described. There is no clear indication of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Prediction:
The image shows a government building, which could be related to the context of the legislation mentioned in the input text. There is no direct inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. The text discusses a bill that would provide free ID cards for homeless people and cites a national survey about the lack of government-issued photo ID among Americans. The image does not contradict this information and could be a representation of a government institution where such a bill might be discussed or passed. Without additional context or evidence to the contrary, there is no clear indication of misinformation based solely on the text and image provided.

Prediction: The image shows two individuals at an event that appears to be related to Haverford College, as indicated by the backdrop that reads "The Campaign for Haverford." This is consistent with the narrative in the input text, which mentions Haverford College and a donation.

Label: 0
Prediction:
The text states that a former sex worker from New Zealand, Catherine Healy, was honored with an order of merit for her services to the rights of sex workers and was made a dame in the Queen's Birthday Honours. The image shows a woman with the logo of "The Guardian" and a timestamp from 2018, which suggests that it is a news article or report from that year. The presence of a reputable news source's logo in the image lends credibility to the text. There is no immediate evidence of inconsistency or misinformation between the text and the image provided. However, without further external verification, we cannot conclusively determine the accuracy of the historical event mentioned.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction: The text matches the content of the image, which appears to be a historical poster encouraging support for the British Merchant Navy during the Battle of the Atlantic. The phrase "Under the 'Red Duster'" refers to the Red Ensign, the flag flown by British Merchant Navy ships. The image shows the Red Ensign and a depiction of merchant ships, which aligns with the text's message. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
news crowning achievement donald trump has just accomplished his lifelong goal of kicking the nations most powerful black family out of their house
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text appears to be a politically charged statement with a potentially misleading framing. It suggests that Donald Trump's goal was to remove a specific black family from their house, implying a personal vendetta or racially motivated action. The image shows former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, who are indeed a powerful black family, in a setting that looks like the White House. However, the transition of presidential power and the subsequent change of residence for the outgoing president is a standard and ceremonial process outlined by the U.S. Constitution, not a personal action taken by the incoming president. The text's framing of this event as a "lifelong goal" of Donald Trump is not supported by factual evidence and is likely intended to provoke a biased response, which indicates misinformation.
Text:

Prediction:
The image shows a young girl working on a car part, which is consistent with the Input Text's description of a girl restoring a Pontiac Fiero. There is nothing in the image to suggest that the information provided in the text is false. The girl appears to be engaged in a mechanical activity, which aligns with the narrative of her being involved in car restoration. Therefore, there is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
president to be jeb bush being held back after going off on an attender after being offered a blunt he was recorded saying grass is crass also gross no circa
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows Jeb Bush in a crowd with a somewhat distressed expression, but there is no evidence in the image that supports the specific claim made in the text about him being held back after going off on an attender or being offered a blunt. The text also includes a quote attributed to Jeb Bush, but without audio or video evidence, it's not possible to verify that he said "grass is crass also gross no circa." The image alone does not confirm the incident described in the text, and the phrase "president to be Jeb Bush" is misleading as Jeb Bush has never been president. Therefore, the post is likely to contain misinformation due to the lack of verifiable evidence and the misleading statement.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a one-dollar bill folded into the shape of a star, which is consistent with the text's description of a customer thanking the poster by making "one of these on the spot." The text also mentions that the customer carried a dragon staff and looked like a "hippi Gandalf," but since the image only needs to verify the part about the creation made by the customer, there is no misinformation detected based on the given text and image. The image complements the text appropriately by showing the origami creation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a watermark from "The Guardian" and a timestamp from "2017," which suggests that the image is from an article or report published by The Guardian in 2017. However, without the current context or updated data, the image does not verify the claim made in the input text about the current state of cancer death rates and survival rates in the United States. The information in the text speaks about ongoing trends, while the image is from a specific point in the past. Therefore, the image does not provide evidence to support the text, and the post could potentially contain misinformation due to the lack of current supporting data in the image.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction: The text and the image appear to be consistent with each other. The image shows a World War II era poster featuring a woman who resembles Margie Stewart, known to be the official United States Army poster girl during that time. The poster includes the phrase "Please don't gamble with your LIFE!" and "BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY OR WRITE!" which aligns with the message conveyed in the input text. The dice in the image show snake eyes, which is commonly associated with bad luck or a losing roll in gambling, often referred to as "crapping out." This visual metaphor supports the text's warning against taking risks with one's words or actions. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the provided content and image.
Text:

Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows the logo of the Associated Press (AP), which is a reputable news organization. The presence of the AP logo suggests that the image is associated with a news report from this organization. The text describes a specific event regarding a scheduled execution. There is no direct inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. However, without additional context or the ability to verify the current news, I cannot definitively confirm the accuracy of the text. The assessment is based solely on the consistency between the text and the image provided.
Text:
russia warns europe against backtracking on migrant boat authorities tried to hack us firms even after divorce you can now donate sperm for a national park say elephants and rhinos
Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text is incoherent and seems to be a random collection of phrases that are not logically connected. It mentions Russia warning Europe, something about migrant boat authorities and hacking US firms, divorce, and donating sperm for a national park in the context of elephants and rhinos. This text does not form a coherent narrative or claim.
The image shows people inside what appears to be a public transport vehicle, possibly a train or bus, with a play button suggesting it is a video. The overlay text is in a language that appears to be Urdu, which I cannot translate. However, the image does not seem to correlate with any of the disjointed statements in the input text.
Given the nonsensical nature of the text and the lack of any clear connection to the image, it is likely that this post contains misinformation or is intended to mislead or confuse.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a man on one knee holding a conch shell towards a woman who appears surprised and is covering her mouth with her hand, which is a common gesture of surprise or shock often associated with receiving a marriage proposal. Both individuals are dressed in tropical, floral attire, which is consistent with the setting of Key West mentioned in the text. The presence of conch shells and the attire of the individuals suggest that the event is related to the conch shell blowing contest. The image supports the text's claim that a woman, presumably the one pictured, won a conch shell blowing contest and received a marriage proposal from a fellow competitor, who is likely the man in the image. There is no evident inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation.

The image shows a gate with several heads, one of which is significantly more polished and shiny than the others. This is consistent with the input text, which claims that the picture was taken in the Czech Republic and features an angel head on a gate that has been polished to a mirror finish due to people touching it for luck. The visual evidence supports the text, indicating that there is no misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows three men wearing motion capture suits standing in front of a green screen, which is consistent with the first part of the input text. However, the claim that these suits are being used so that "someone who knows how to do special effects can turn them into women of color" cannot be verified from the image alone. Motion capture technology is commonly used to record movements that are then applied to digital character models in films and video games, but the image does not provide any evidence that these specific men are being turned into women of color through special effects. Without additional context or evidence, the claim seems speculative and potentially misleading, suggesting misinformation.

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not appear to show British army medics surveying a recent mortar attack at the Battle of Arnhem. The top half of the image shows three individuals who do not seem to be in a warzone or dressed as medics from the World War II era. They are wearing modern clothing and are standing in a peaceful setting that does not resemble a battlefield. The bottom half of the image shows a scene with smoke and damaged vehicles, but it does not clearly depict a historical battle scene or medics attending to soldiers. The lack of consistency between the text and the image suggests that the post may contain misinformation.

Prediction: The image shows a vineyard with a chateau, which is consistent with the text mentioning vineyards, cellars, and chateaus in relation to Champagne. Additionally, the presence of the BBC News logo suggests that the image is from a reputable news source, which lends credibility to the claim. It is indeed true that UNESCO has granted World Heritage status to the Champagne region of France, which is known for its vineyards and production of champagne. Therefore, there is no indication of misinformation based on the text and image provided.

Prediction:
The text mentions a honeymoon in Texas and a 50th wedding anniversary in San Diego, California, but the image does not provide any information that would confirm or deny these events. The image shows an old building with a sign that reads "Cassel Mtn. Tire & Recapping," which does not seem to have any direct connection to a honeymoon or an anniversary celebration. The lack of relevant information in the image to support the text's claims makes it impossible to confirm the authenticity of the post, but it does not necessarily indicate misinformation either. However, the text itself contains inconsistencies and lacks clarity (e.g., "spring of somewhere in texas sometime in this s" is incomplete and does not specify a year), which could suggest misinformation or a mistake in the text.
Text:
sick of being constantly compared to hitler kitty decided to go for controversial pigment replacement therapy the irony that she removed all the black and became fully white in a effort to be less hitlerish was lost on her because shes a cat
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that a cat underwent "pigment replacement therapy" to change its fur color, which is a procedure that does not exist for cats. Furthermore, the text anthropomorphizes the cat by suggesting it has human-like concerns about being compared to Hitler and makes a decision based on this, which is not possible as cats do not have such complex thoughts or the ability to make such decisions. The image shows a white cat, but there is no evidence to support the claim that the cat underwent any kind of pigment therapy; cats can naturally be white without any medical intervention. Therefore, the post contains misinformation.
Text:
a onearmed man whose missing limb was severed from the shoulder in a freak biking accident has invented a prosthetic replacement which will allow him to fly a plane
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows two individuals in what appears to be the cockpit of an aircraft. Both individuals have both arms visible, and there is no evidence of a prosthetic device in use. The person on the right, who is presumably the pilot, does not appear to be a one-armed man with a prosthetic replacement as described in the text. Therefore, the image does not support the claim made in the text, suggesting that there may be misinformation present.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows two men embracing, which is consistent with the narrative of a reunion described in the input text. The setting appears to be informal and possibly outdoors, which could be indicative of a fundraiser event. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text, and the emotional display between the two individuals could be indicative of the significant personal connection mentioned in the text. Therefore, there is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the accompanying text.
Text:
the mystery lives on researchers at oxford have concluded that theyll never know how outback steakhouse bread can be so dark brown but taste regular
Label: 1
Prediction:
The claim that researchers at Oxford have concluded that they'll never know how Outback Steakhouse bread can be so dark brown but taste regular is likely misinformation. It is highly improbable that a reputable academic institution like Oxford would conduct research on the taste characteristics of bread from a specific restaurant chain. The image shows dark brown bread, which is consistent with the description in the text, but it does not provide any evidence regarding the alleged research by Oxford, nor does it validate the claim made in the text. Therefore, the inconsistency lies in the plausibility of the research topic rather than a discrepancy between the image and the text.
Text:
omg jenny your genital herpes must be out of toilet paper again so he had tipped the soda that he had lost his eyesight due to not regret it later
Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text is nonsensical and incoherent, with phrases that do not logically connect to form a meaningful statement. It mentions genital herpes, being out of toilet paper, tipping soda, and losing eyesight, all in one sentence without a clear context or logical connection. The image provided does not seem to correlate with the text, as it shows a person holding a sign with a heart on it, which does not provide any evidence or context for the claims made in the text. The lack of coherence and relevance between the text and the image suggests that the post may contain misinformation or is not presenting information in a factual or logical manner.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a box of assorted LEGO bricks being spilled out onto a wooden floor, which is consistent with the description in the input text of a program that accepts used LEGO bricks. The image complements the text by visually representing the concept of donating used LEGOs. There is no evident inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation.
Text:
a poster calling for australians to avenge the sinking of a hospital ship the centaur after it was sunk by a japanese submarine poster wwii nationalism
Label: 1
Prediction: The image shows a vintage poster with the phrases "WORK SAVE FIGHT" and "and so AVENGE THE NURSES!" prominently displayed. The poster depicts a hospital ship on fire and sinking, with a person in the water nearby, which is consistent with the description of a poster calling for Australians to avenge the sinking of a hospital ship, the Centaur, after it was sunk by a Japanese submarine during WWII. The presence of the Red Cross symbol on the ship's side indicates that it is a hospital ship, aligning with the historical event where the AHS Centaur was indeed attacked and sunk by a Japanese submarine in 1943. The text and the image are consistent with each other and with historical facts, suggesting there is no misinformation present in this post.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text mentions a "simple solution for using your ladder on the way buying blurays" and "a pair of burning underwear in front of a member of the public," which is nonsensical and does not correlate with the image provided. The image shows a person with a cat, and there is no ladder, blurays, or burning underwear visible. The text and the image are inconsistent with each other, and the text itself does not make logical sense, indicating misinformation.
Text:
there is actually good happening in ferguson some extraordinary acts of kindness and generosity from people trying hard to hold their city together
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a person standing in front of a business with the word "freestyle" and "barber" visible, suggesting it could be a barbershop. The presence of the individual in front of the establishment does not contradict the text's message about acts of kindness and generosity in Ferguson. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided. The text speaks to positive actions in the community, and the image does not dispute this claim. Without additional context that suggests otherwise, we cannot assume misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows an elderly couple smiling and posing together, which is consistent with the sentiment expressed in the input text. The text talks about a couple, Sigi and Hanka Siegreich, who have been in love since meeting in a Nazi slave labor camp and still have strong feelings for each other after many years. The image complements this narrative by showing a couple that appears to be affectionate and happy together, which could be representative of Sigi and Hanka in their later years. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that Yao Ming is asking customers outside a GameStop about their interest in a video game featuring his long legs. The image shows Yao Ming standing outside a GameStop store. However, the claim itself is highly unusual and not typical behavior for a celebrity of Yao Ming's stature. Additionally, there is no evidence in the image that he is interacting with customers or discussing a video game. The scenario described in the text seems implausible and is likely fabricated, suggesting that the post contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text describes a Vietnamese poster encouraging the raising of cats to protect crops, which aligns with the image shown. The image appears to be a propaganda poster featuring two cats and Vietnamese text, which is consistent with the practice of using cats for pest control in agricultural settings. There is no evident inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image does not show elephants, which contradicts the text that talks about elephants making a comeback in Chad. Instead, the image appears to show a group of hippopotamuses in water. This inconsistency suggests that there is misinformation in the post, as the image does not support the text's claim about elephants.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a child wearing a paper mask, which could be indicative of a school or educational setting where creative activities take place. This is consistent with the text, which mentions a school for children with autism. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the information provided in the text. Therefore, based on the information given, there is no clear evidence of misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text is incoherent and does not form a logical sentence or statement. It appears to be a fragmented collection of thoughts or statements about personal life, relationships, and financial status. The image provided shows a person, but it does not corroborate or provide evidence for any of the claims made in the text. There is no context or information that connects the image to the text, making it impossible to verify the statements. Therefore, the inconsistency and lack of clarity between the text and the image suggest that this post may contain misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a piece of paper attached to a bathroom stall door, which is consistent with the description provided in the input text. The text mentions that in a girls' bathroom stall at a university, girls have written about their horrifying life experiences, and someone replied. The image complements this by showing a handwritten note, suggesting that it could be one of the replies or experiences shared. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a man standing in front of the Hillsboro Civic Center, which is consistent with the text mentioning the mayor of Hillsboro. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text, and the content of the text is a personal account that does not present factual information that can be verified or debunked through the image. Therefore, there is no evidence of misinformation based on the image and text provided.
Text:
we were given a tiny mexican worry doll after our meal at a local restaurant youre supposed to put them under your pillow to make your worries go away
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a small doll that appears to be a Mexican worry doll, which is consistent with the input text. Mexican worry dolls are indeed a cultural tradition where the dolls are believed to take away worries when placed under a pillow at night. The text describes a practice that aligns with the traditional use of these dolls, and the image supports the text by showing what a worry doll typically looks like. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
soviet antireligiousmuslim from set in the caucasus region the mullah being swept away holds the koran and the text translates to cleanliness is the foundation of good health
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a Soviet propaganda poster that depicts a figure sweeping away religious figures, including one holding a book that could be interpreted as the Quran. The text accompanying the image states that the mullah is being swept away and holds the Quran, with a translation that reads "cleanliness is the foundation of good health." This suggests that the poster is promoting the idea of removing religion in the name of health and progress, which aligns with the Soviet anti-religious campaigns. However, without the ability to verify the translation or the full context of the poster, it is not possible to definitively determine if the text is an accurate description of the image. Therefore, the prediction of misinformation is based on the potential for the text to misrepresent the intent or content of the poster, not on a definitive analysis of the text's accuracy.
Text:
no one shall go hungry no one shall be cold each year there was a drive to solicit donations to help the needy by the winter aid nazi party charity national socialist
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text describes a charity drive by the Winterhilfswerk (Winter Aid), which was indeed a part of the National Socialist (Nazi) Party's welfare organization during the time of the Third Reich in Germany. The image shows a poster from the Winterhilfswerk with the text "Keiner soll hungern! Keiner soll frieren!" which translates to "No one shall go hungry! No one shall be cold!" and is consistent with the message in the input text. The date on the poster, 1934/35, aligns with the historical period of the Nazi regime. Therefore, there is no misinformation present as the image and the text are consistent with each other and with historical facts.
Text:
ruben salazar poster journalist working on a story about police abuse lapd warned him to stop killed by a teargas projectile that tore through his head fired by sheriffs deputy
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text and the image are consistent with each other. The text describes Ruben Salazar as a journalist who was working on a story about police abuse and was warned by the LAPD to stop. It states that he was killed by a teargas projectile fired by a sheriff's deputy. The image is a poster that includes Ruben Salazar's name and references an incident involving a deputy named Thomas Wilson, who shot the grenade that killed Ruben Salazar. The content of the poster supports the text's claim about the circumstances of Salazar's death. Therefore, there is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided does not support the text. The text talks about a man who has experienced personal tragedies and has helped save people's lives, but the image shows a man holding a tiger cub with no context that connects to the story of heroism or personal loss. There is no evidence in the image of a funeral, a house fire, or any act of saving lives. Therefore, the inconsistency suggests that this post may contain misinformation.
Text:
if these dates are right the average age at death for these revolutionary war soldiers was nearly with two living well into their s the average life expectancy for that time was under years with the average for people who managed to reach age only years
Label: 0
Prediction:
The text claims that the average life expectancy at the time was under 40 years, and that the average for those who reached age 50 was only 60 years. However, the image shows a plaque with the birth and death years of several individuals who were Revolutionary War soldiers. According to the dates on the plaque, many of these individuals lived well beyond both the average life expectancy mentioned in the text and the average age for those who reached 50. For example, John Aldridge lived to be 77, Samuel Dooley lived to be 78, and John Kersey lived to be 87. These ages are significantly higher than the life expectancies mentioned in the text, suggesting that the text may contain misinformation regarding the life expectancy of that era.
Text:
pokemon and humans reach a peace treaty for the first time in years ending the pokemon war which had ravaged the japanese countryside and leading to creation of the pika dynasty
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that Pokémon and humans have reached a peace treaty, ending a war and leading to the creation of a "Pika dynasty." This is misinformation because Pokémon are fictional creatures from a media franchise created by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. There has never been a real war between Pokémon and humans, nor has there been the creation of a dynasty named after Pikachu (the Pokémon character that "Pika" likely refers to). The image shows a person in a Pikachu costume interacting with a human, which is a common promotional or entertainment event related to the Pokémon franchise and does not provide evidence of a peace treaty or war. The scenario described in the text is entirely fictional and not based on real events.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text appears to be a jumbled collection of phrases that do not form a coherent statement. It mentions a shooting near a Minnesota protest, a police killing, a respiratory illness escalating among children and families, and a worker in Toronto being kind to her beliefs. The image shows mounted police officers on horses, which does not provide any evidence or context that would confirm or deny the disparate claims made in the text. The lack of coherence and the mismatch between the text and the image suggest that the post may contain misinformation.
Text:

Prediction:
The image shows two different box designs for Busch beer, with the corresponding cans next to each box. The top box and can represent the old design, while the bottom box and can represent the new design. The text states that the new can design was purchased in the old type of box, and the image supports this by showing a comparison of the old and new box and can designs. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
so i have this united nations fight for freedom usa poster and i have this free french flag in the bottom corner but when i search this up i dont see this anywhere i wanna know if this is rare or not thanks
Label: 1
Prediction: The image shows a poster titled "THE UNITED NATIONS FIGHT FOR FREEDOM" featuring the Statue of Liberty and a collection of flags from various countries. The presence of a Free French flag (the flag with the Cross of Lorraine) in the bottom corner is consistent with the historical context of the United Nations during World War II, where the Free French forces were recognized as a government-in-exile and a member of the Allied forces. The text does not make any claims about the poster's rarity or historical accuracy that can be directly refuted by the image. The question about the poster's rarity is subjective and cannot be verified solely based on the image provided.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that Harry Potter used an unplugged outlet power strip as a wand and uttered "Louie Anderson" instead of a spell, which is inconsistent with the Harry Potter series' narrative and established magical lore. The image shows a character who appears to be Harry Potter from the film adaptations of the book series, and in no part of the Harry Potter books or movies does Harry Potter use an unplugged outlet power strip as a wand or mumble "Louie Anderson" as a spell. The text seems to be a humorous or satirical take rather than an accurate depiction of events from the Harry Potter series.

nbc announces new militarythemed reality show that enthusiastically melds warfare and fame by matching up military veterans with celebrities like todd palin one exmilitary member vows to take nick lachey guy in the boy band and turn him into nick lachey bad boy guy with a gun
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a group of people, some of whom are recognizable celebrities, posing with military-style weapons in a setting that suggests a promotional photo for a television show. The presence of celebrities in a military-themed context aligns with the description of the reality show mentioned in the input text, where military veterans are paired with celebrities. However, without additional context or verification, it is not possible to confirm the authenticity of the show's existence or the specific details mentioned in the text, such as the involvement of Todd Palin or the transformation of Nick Lachey. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine whether the post contains misinformation. However, the image does appear to support the text's claim of a military-themed reality show involving celebrities.
Text:
nearly half of all queenslanders dealt with by the criminal justice system for child exploitation material offences in the past decade are children
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided is blurred and does not offer any verifiable information that could confirm or refute the claim made in the input text. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from the image alone whether the statement about Queenslanders and child exploitation material offences is accurate. However, the use of a blurred image that suggests sensitive content without providing clear evidence can be a tactic used in misinformation campaigns to evoke emotional responses or suggest credibility where there is none. Without additional context or reliable sources to verify the claim, the post should be treated with skepticism.
Text:

Prediction:
The image shows a turkey on a pathway, which is consistent with the input text that mentions turkeys living in a zoo. There is nothing in the image to directly contradict the claim that the turkey has been named Cosmos and has been residing at the zoo for a couple of months. Without further evidence to the contrary, there is no clear indication of misinformation based on the image and the text provided.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image has been digitally altered to show the Queen holding a bizarre, oversized ceremonial blade which is inconsistent with the traditional ceremonial swords used in knighting ceremonies. This indicates that the image is not an authentic depiction of a knighting ceremony and therefore suggests misinformation in relation to the text.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a scene that appears to be an awards ceremony or recognition event, which is consistent with the Input Text describing a principal who rewards students for academic achievements. The man in the image could be the principal, and he seems to be handing something to a student, which could be cash or a certificate related to academic performance. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided.
Text:
s poster from the peruvian social equality and indigenous rights group the sendero luminoso the quote says besides for power all else is an illusion lenin
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a poster with a quote attributed to Lenin, "Salvo el poder todo es ilusión," which translates to "Besides for power, all else is an illusion." However, there is no record of Lenin saying this exact phrase. The Sendero Luminoso, or Shining Path, is a Maoist guerrilla group in Peru known for its violent tactics, and not primarily an indigenous rights group as the text claims. The poster appears to be propaganda for the Shining Path, using communist imagery and possibly misattributing a quote to Lenin to lend it legitimacy. Therefore, the text contains misinformation regarding the attribution of the quote and the characterization of the Sendero Luminoso.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not correspond to the content of the text. The text talks about the Chicago Cubs beating the Cleveland Indians in extra innings of Game 7 of the World Series, marking their first win in many years. However, the image is a painting depicting a scene that is not related to baseball or the World Series. It appears to be a historical or allegorical painting featuring animals and a human, which has no connection to a contemporary sports event. Therefore, the inconsistency between the text and the image suggests that this post may contain misinformation.
Text:
life need to cry at work but dont want your male coworkers to lose respect for you here are photos of damaged boats to pretend that youre sad about
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text suggests using photos of damaged boats to pretend to be sad about something other than the real reason for crying at work. The image shows a boat on fire, which could be interpreted as a "damaged boat." However, the concept of using pictures of damaged boats to hide the real reason for crying at work is not a standard or recommended practice and seems to be a satirical or facetious suggestion rather than genuine advice. Therefore, the post likely contains misinformation as it promotes a deceptive and impractical method for handling emotions in the workplace.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a group of individuals of different ages, equipped with lawn care tools, which supports the text's claim about a man helping the disabled and elderly with lawn mowing and being a role model for young kids. The presence of both adults and children, as well as the lawn care equipment, suggests that the text and image are consistent with each other, with no immediate signs of misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a person who appears to be Donald Trump on the phone, which could be consistent with the claim that there is a transcript of calls. However, the claim that the Boston bombers were from the Middle East is misinformation. The Boston Marathon bombers were identified as brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who were of Chechen descent but lived in the United States at the time of the attack. Chechnya is not in the Middle East; it is a republic of Russia located in the North Caucasus region. Therefore, the text contains misinformation regarding the origin of the Boston bombers.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a young child who appears to be healthy and happy, which is consistent with the Input Text's claim that the child was born healthy and recently celebrated his sixth birthday. There is no direct evidence in the image to contradict the text's claim about the surgical procedure or the child's current health. Therefore, based on the information provided, there is no indication of misinformation. However, without additional evidence or context, such as medical records or a news report, it is not possible to fully verify the accuracy of the medical details provided in the text.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided is a placeholder or loading image from Reuters, a well-known international news organization. While the image itself does not directly confirm or contradict the text, the use of a Reuters placeholder image does not inherently indicate misinformation. The text describes a legal settlement involving New York City and individuals wrongfully convicted, which is a type of event that could be reported by a news organization such as Reuters. Without additional context or evidence to suggest that the text is false, there is no clear indication of misinformation based solely on the image provided.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image does not match the description provided in the input text. The text describes a dish that includes pizza with Italian bread crumbs, a deep-fried chimichanga with muenster, and a slab of cheddar cheese with sour cream and olives for texture. However, the image shows two slices of ham with what appears to be ketchup drawn on them to make a smiley face, which does not correspond to any of the food items described in the text. Therefore, there is a discrepancy between the text and the image, indicating misinformation.
Text:
i know nothing about radiation but brought my geiger counter on a flight across the us to test the impact of cosmic radiation average reading at altitude was units versus just on the ground
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a Geiger counter with a reading, but the units are not specified in the text or the image. Without knowing the units of measurement, it is impossible to assess the validity of the statement regarding the average reading at altitude versus on the ground. Additionally, the text claims an average reading at altitude and a specific reading on the ground, but the image does not provide evidence of the ground reading for comparison. Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the claim, and the post may contain misinformation due to the lack of context and clarity.
Text:
san francisco sues trump over sanctuary city order both the san francisco and boston actions contend that trumps orders in question violate the th amendment of the us constitution which states that powers not granted to the federal government should fall to the states
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a group of individuals, presumably officials, at a press conference with a seal that reads "City Attorney." This setting is consistent with the type of event where a city might announce legal action, such as a lawsuit against a federal order. The text mentions San Francisco suing over a sanctuary city order and references constitutional grounds for the lawsuit. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text, and the setting is plausible for the announcement of a legal action. Therefore, there is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided.
Text:

Prediction:
Based on the provided text and image, there is no clear evidence of misinformation. The text is a personal statement expressing affection and respect for a teacher who has passed away. The image shows an individual who could be the subject of the text, but without additional context or information, there is no way to confirm or deny the claims made in the text. Therefore, there is no basis to predict misinformation solely from the text-image pair provided.

The somber expressions and attire of the people in the image are consistent with the Input Text, which describes a funeral setting where many are mourning the death of a high school principal. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided.

Prediction: The image is a poster that matches the description provided in the input text. It contains the phrases "We will destroy imperialism from the outside" and "They will destroy it from the inside," which align with the text. Additionally, the poster mentions OSPAAAL (Organization of Solidarity with the People of Asia, Africa and Latin America) and the Day of International Solidarity with the African-American People, which is consistent with the historical context of OSPAAAL's activities and messaging. There is no evident inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation.

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a person holding what appears to be toys, including a Star Wars toy, which is consistent with the text mentioning donations of Star Wars, Star Trek, and Doctor Who toys to a charity after a burglary. The presence of the BBC News watermark suggests that the image is from a reputable news source, which lends credibility to the story. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows two individuals wearing clothing labeled "INMATE," which is consistent with the context of the input text discussing prison inmates. The image supports the text in that it is reasonable to assume that it depicts inmates within a prison environment. However, the image does not provide specific evidence regarding the inmates' involvement in writing software or the software's impact on tracking prison food expenditures and catching vendor fraud. The claim in the text is plausible and not directly contradicted by the image, so there is no clear indication of misinformation based solely on the image and text provided. Without additional context or evidence, we cannot conclude that the post contains misinformation.
Text:
a violent attack on free speech at middlebury liberals must defend the right of conservative students to invite speakers of their choice even if they find their views abhorrent
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a protest with people holding signs, one of which reads "NO EUGENICS." This suggests that the protest is about a specific issue, likely related to a speaker or event associated with eugenics, which is a controversial and widely condemned ideology. The text mentions a "violent attack on free speech" and suggests that liberals must defend the right of conservative students to invite any speakers, even those with abhorrent views. However, the image does not provide evidence of a violent attack nor does it specify that the protest is against conservative students' rights to free speech. Instead, it shows a peaceful protest. The mismatch between the claim of a violent attack and the peaceful nature of the protest depicted in the image suggests that the post may contain misinformation regarding the nature of the event at Middlebury.

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided does not show an old man with gauged ears, as described in the input text. Instead, it shows a person driving a vintage Volkswagen Beetle. There is no visible evidence in the image to support the claim made in the text about the old man with gauged ears. Therefore, there is a discrepancy between the text and the image, indicating that misinformation may exist.
Text:
this list of decorative placemats is a testament to our restraint at a time when literally any game of thrones content whatsoever would go viral
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a decorative placemat, which is consistent with the text's mention of "decorative placemats." There is no direct claim in the text that requires validation against the image, and the statement about "Game of Thrones" content going viral is an opinion rather than a factual claim that can be verified with the image. Therefore, there is no evidence of misinformation based on the provided text and image.
Text:
chinas womens federation which protects womens rights and interests pretty girls dont need a lot of education to marry into rich powerful family but girls with average or ugly appearance will find it difficult by the time they get ma or phd they are already old like yellowed pearls
Label: 0
Prediction:
The text claims to quote the China Women's Federation, suggesting that they made a statement that undermines women's education and promotes a stereotypical and sexist view that women's appearances are more important than their education or career achievements. This kind of statement would be highly controversial and inconsistent with the goals of an organization that is supposed to protect women's rights and interests.
The image shows a woman's face, possibly from an advertisement or art, with another woman's reflection in the background. The image does not provide any verifiable context or evidence that would support the text's claim about the China Women's Federation. There is no visible connection between the image and the alleged statement.
Given the nature of the organization in question and the lack of any corroborating evidence in the image, it is likely that the text contains misinformation.

india successfully launches its first lunar lander bound for the moon india could become the fourth nation to touch down on the lunar surface
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a lunar lander, which appears to be in a cleanroom environment typically used for the assembly and testing of spaceflight hardware. The lander is consistent with what one would expect for a spacecraft designed to land on the Moon. The text claims that India has successfully launched its first lunar lander bound for the Moon and could become the fourth nation to touch down on the lunar surface. The image supports the text as it shows a lunar lander, suggesting that India has indeed developed such technology. There is no evident inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. However, without additional context or verification from authoritative sources, it is not possible to confirm the current status of India's lunar exploration missions.
Text:
his palette is rather broad from kerosene to varnishes and no one has been able to figure out so far how to talk sense into such a connoisseur antialcohol poster soviet union
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text describes a Soviet anti-alcohol poster, mentioning a palette ranging from kerosene to varnishes, which implies the depiction of a person consuming a variety of non-drinkable substances. The image shows a Soviet-era poster with a caricature of a man drinking from a bottle labeled with the Cyrillic script that translates to "Polivaet," meaning "He's watering" or "He's pouring it down." The table is filled with various bottles and containers, some of which resemble household chemicals and not consumable beverages. This aligns with the typical style of Soviet anti-alcohol propaganda, which often used exaggerated and grotesque imagery to discourage excessive drinking and the consumption of harmful substances. Therefore, the image is consistent with the text, and there is no misinformation present.
Text:
dalai lamas emotional reunion with guard who aided flight from tibet buddhist leader meets naren chandra das years after he escorted him in india after his escape from chinese authorities
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows an emotional reunion between two individuals, one of whom is wearing a beret with a badge that could be indicative of a military or security force, which aligns with the description of a guard in the text. The presence of the logo "from The Guardian" suggests that this image is from a reputable news source, which adds credibility to the event being reported. The text describes a reunion between the Dalai Lama and a guard who helped him during his flight from Tibet, and the image seems to support this narrative, showing an emotional embrace that could be consistent with such a reunion. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a plant growing in a jar, which is consistent with the text's claim that a melon grew from a seed in the dirt. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided. The text does not make any extraordinary claims, and the image appears to support the text's narrative that a plant (presumably a melon seedling) is growing in the jar while the potato did not grow.
Text:
a supreme court judge in brazil has suspended president jair bolsonaros plan to transfer power over indigenous land to the countrys agriculture ministry
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows indigenous people in traditional attire, seemingly in a protest or a standoff situation, with police officers in the background. This visual is consistent with the type of event that might occur if there were a controversial political issue regarding indigenous land rights, such as the one described in the input text. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based solely on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
florida man who ran onto dale mabry died of cocaine inside cookie monster lands florida man shoots wife in butt after she refused to be extradited on porn charges police say
Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text appears to be a nonsensical combination of multiple unrelated and sensational headlines, which suggests that it is likely misinformation. The text is incoherent and seems to string together several different news stories into one sentence, which is not a standard practice for credible news reporting.
The image provided shows a person with a tattoo that reads "SUPER BOWL LI CHAMPIONS" with a star symbol, which is commonly associated with the Dallas Cowboys, an NFL team. There is no clear connection between the image and the text. The image does not provide any evidence or context that would relate to the bizarre claims made in the text, such as someone dying of cocaine inside a Cookie Monster, a Florida man shooting his wife, or extradition on porn charges.
The lack of coherence in the text and the unrelated image suggest that the post is likely to contain misinformation.
Text:
life heartwarming chipotle is offering a gift certificate to the family of anyone who dies while preventing a chipotle burrito from getting wet
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that Chipotle is offering a gift certificate to the family of anyone who dies while preventing a Chipotle burrito from getting wet. The image shows a sign that appears to be on a Chipotle window, acknowledging a sacrifice made to keep something dry and stating "Now we say thanks."
The claim in the text is highly unusual and not typical of a company's promotional campaign, as it involves a life-threatening scenario for a trivial reason (keeping a burrito dry). The image, while it seems to support the text, does not provide credible evidence that such an offer exists. It is more likely that this is a satirical or fictional post rather than a genuine company policy. Therefore, the post is likely to contain misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided appears to be from a video game, as indicated by the visual style and the "Thot Annihilator" text, which is not something that would be found in a genuine historical photograph. The text claims that the image is of the user's father in Vietnam, which is inconsistent with the video game nature of the image. Therefore, this post contains misinformation.
Text:
mac bohonnon fulfills olympic dream in aerials aerialist who was in the eighth grade when he left home to pursue the olympics is thrilled with fifth place at sochi calling it an unbelievable feeling
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows an aerial skier who appears to be wearing an Olympic uniform, complete with a helmet and goggles, and is making a celebratory gesture. The outfit and the backdrop with Olympic rings support the text's claim about an aerialist at the Sochi Olympics. There is no evident inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. The athlete's expression and gesture could be indicative of the "unbelievable feeling" mentioned in the text after achieving a significant accomplishment, such as placing fifth at the Olympics.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a man holding a black cat, which is consistent with the story of a person being reunited with their pet. The presence of "The Guardian" logo, a reputable news organization, suggests that the image is likely from a news article covering the story. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided.
Text:
sweet karma your high school computer lab teacher who installed the browser blocker that stopped you from playing flash games is very sick now
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a woman standing in a computer lab, which could be consistent with the setting of a high school computer lab teacher. However, there is no evidence in the image that indicates the woman's current health status or any actions she may have taken regarding browser blockers. The text makes a specific claim about the individual's health and past actions, which cannot be substantiated or refuted by the image alone. Therefore, without additional context or evidence, the claim in the text could be considered misinformation.
Text:
should we boycott the olympics newsweek cover from published days after jimmy carter called for a boycott of the moscow olympics to protest the soviet occupation of afghanistan
Label: 1
Prediction: The image shows a Newsweek cover with the title "Should We Boycott The Olympics?" and the date January 28, 1980, which aligns with the historical context provided in the input text regarding Jimmy Carter's call for a boycott of the Moscow Olympics to protest the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. The cover appears to be a legitimate historical magazine cover discussing the topic of the Olympic boycott, which was a real event that took place during that time. There is no evident inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a train and people, which is consistent with the topic of public transport mentioned in the input text. The presence of "The Guardian" logo, a reputable news organization, suggests that the image is likely to be from a legitimate news report about Germany's proposal to make public transport free to reduce road traffic and meet EU air pollution targets. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
my dad took a few tips for president trump uses his weekly address to talk about the entire sky and shows curious clouds of gas and dust move rather than stars
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text is incoherent and contains elements that are unrelated to each other, making it difficult to discern a clear message. It mentions someone's dad taking tips from President Trump, who is then said to use his weekly address to talk about the sky, clouds of gas, and dust. The image shows a nebula, which is a cloud of gas and dust in space, often associated with star formation. However, the text's reference to President Trump's weekly address is incongruous with the image of a nebula. Additionally, the text's mention of "curious clouds of gas and dust move rather than stars" is scientifically inaccurate, as stars do move, albeit not in the same way as gas and dust in a nebula. The lack of coherence and scientific inaccuracy in the text, combined with the mismatch between the text and the image, suggests that the post contains misinformation.
Text:
edith little edie bouvier beale on the set of grey gardens the film is notable for exposing her familys eccentric hoarding habits and is widely considered one of the best documentaries ever made
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not appear to be from the documentary "Grey Gardens" or to feature Edith 'Little Edie' Bouvier Beale. The quality and style of the image suggest it might be from a different source, possibly a low-resolution video or a different context entirely. The person in the image does not resemble Little Edie, and the setting does not match the known aesthetic of the Beale's home as depicted in the documentary. Therefore, the image does not support the text, indicating that there is misinformation present in the post.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows what appears to be an organized encampment or community space, which could be consistent with the type of area where wifi hot spots might be set up to assist the homeless population. There is no clear evidence in the image to directly contradict the claim made in the text that wifi hot spots are helping homeless people in the Pacific Northwest to find jobs and complete their education. Therefore, based on the image provided, there is no indication of misinformation.
Text:
idk if this is really that interesting but i took put the chip thing from my old leap frog explorer game and i have no idea what those words are nor do i think i wrote them
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a LeapFrog Explorer game cartridge with its internal chip exposed. The text on the chip is not clearly visible in the image, making it impossible to verify whether the words are unusual or not as the user claims. However, the presence of text on the internal chip of a game cartridge is not unusual in itself, as manufacturers often print labels, codes, or other identifiers on components. The user's claim that they do not recognize the words and do not think they wrote them does not necessarily indicate misinformation, as it is common for consumers not to be familiar with the technical inscriptions on internal electronic components. However, without clear evidence to support the claim that the words are out of the ordinary, the post could be misleading to others who might interpret the situation as something suspicious or nefarious when it could be entirely normal. Therefore, the prediction of misinformation is based on the potential for the post to mislead rather than on definitive evidence of false information.
Text:
dems plot next move in trump taxreturn battle trumps allies have signaled they would be happy to take the fight to the high court where the president has appointed two justices including brett kanvanaugh
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows two individuals who appear to be in a formal setting, possibly related to legal or governmental proceedings. There is no direct evidence in the image that contradicts the information provided in the input text. The text discusses a political strategy regarding the battle over President Trump's tax returns and mentions Brett Kavanaugh, who is indeed a justice appointed by President Trump to the Supreme Court. The image does not provide any specific information regarding the "dems plot" or the battle over the tax returns, nor does it confirm or deny the claim about Trump's allies' willingness to take the fight to the high court. Therefore, based on the image alone, there is no clear indication of misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not depict a real-life event or scene from history. Instead, it appears to be a still from a fantasy or fictional movie, showing a creature that does not exist in reality. This is inconsistent with the Input Text, which describes a historical event involving a young Jewish boy during the Nazi era. The image does not support the text, indicating that the post contains misinformation by pairing an unrelated and fictional image with a serious historical claim.
Text:
philando castiles mother donates money to wipe out students school lunch debt in the face of a tragedy this woman displays an incredible sense of humanity
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a person holding a large photograph of Philando Castile, which is consistent with the text mentioning his name. The presence of the photograph at what appears to be a public demonstration or march suggests that the subject is of significant public interest, which aligns with the context of the text that implies a notable action taken by Philando Castile's mother. The image does not contradict the text, and there is no clear evidence of misinformation based solely on the image and the text provided. However, without additional verification of the specific claim that Philando Castile's mother donated money to clear students' school lunch debt, it is not possible to definitively confirm the accuracy of the text. The assessment is based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a payphone with a sign indicating "FREE CALLS" for various services, including Wells Fargo, Chase Bank, EBT Card Services, Social Security, and job finding assistance. This is consistent with the input text, which states that the public library has a payphone that allows for free calls for services to assist those in need who may not have a cell phone. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
the polarising express bluestate republicans could become almost as rare as white southern democrats if that were to happen congress would become even more polarised than it already is
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image appears to be a political cartoon, which typically uses symbolism and exaggeration to convey a message or opinion. In this case, the image shows a train labeled "Polarising Express" with a Republican elephant on the tracks, which seems to symbolize the concept of polarization within the political context mentioned in the input text. The text discusses the potential increase in polarization within Congress, particularly focusing on the rarity of "blue state Republicans" and comparing them to "white southern Democrats." The image complements the text by illustrating the concept of political polarization. There is no direct evidence of misinformation based solely on the consistency between the text and the image. Political cartoons are a form of editorial commentary and are not meant to be taken as literal representations of news or facts.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a braille reader, which is a device used by visually impaired individuals to read text that is converted into braille. This is relevant to the topic of accessibility mentioned in the input text. The text discusses Domino's Pizza taking a case to the Supreme Court regarding the accessibility of their website design, in relation to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The image complements the text by illustrating a tool that might be used by someone affected by the website's accessibility. There is no direct inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. However, without additional context or evidence, it is not possible to verify the current legal status or the claims made in the text. The assessment is solely based on the consistency between the text and the image provided.
Text:
fwd id rather be nuked than controlled by the liberal degenerates questioning kavanaughs character fwdfwdfwd the bible villains of the justices were successfully confirmed anyways
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text and the image provided do not seem to be directly related. The text appears to be a politically charged statement with a strong bias, expressing a preference for extreme measures over being "controlled by the liberal degenerates" and mentioning the confirmation of "the bible villains of the justices," likely referring to a political event or figures. The image, however, is a humorous meme showing a military drill instructor and a soldier, with a joke about camouflage practice. The image does not provide any evidence or context that would support or refute the claims made in the text. Therefore, the inconsistency between the text and the image suggests that the post may contain misinformation, as the image does not corroborate the text's message.
Text:
inhumane the us government is a painting by leng jun his art is considered a complex psychological behavior because of the intolerance of this president
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text and the image provided do not align in content, which suggests misinformation. The text claims that "the us government is a painting by leng jun" and refers to "intolerance of this president," which is vague and does not directly relate to the content of the image. The image shows a screenshot of a social media post with a quote that appears to be from a father speaking about his daughter and a black man, which has no apparent connection to Leng Jun, a contemporary artist known for his hyper-realistic paintings, or to any specific president or government. The inconsistency between the text and the image indicates that the post is likely to contain misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a leg with a large bruise that could be consistent with the description provided in the text. Bruises can indeed take on various shapes and can last for several days, which aligns with the claim of the bruise resembling a "buttcheek" and still being visible four days later. There is nothing in the image to directly contradict the text, so there is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the provided content.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text is nonsensical and incoherent, mentioning a bill requiring teacher training on not having sex by pretending to be rescued from a car dangling on a cliff, and then abruptly asking about the president of the United States. The image provided is of a lunar eclipse, which has no logical connection to the text. The text itself seems to be a random string of words without any clear meaning or context, and the image does not complement or provide evidence for the text in any way. Therefore, this post contains misinformation due to the lack of coherence and relevance between the text and the image.
Text:

Prediction: The text and the image appear to be consistent with each other. The image shows a poster with text in Romanian that translates to "Workers and peasants, start the battle for liberation! Come in the social-democrat party, vote the lists with the triangular sign Romania pro communist." This matches the input text provided, which seems to be an attempt to translate the Romanian text into English. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based solely on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Prediction:
The image shows an infant, which could be consistent with the text that mentions a mother's loss of her infant son. Although the image does not directly confirm the mother's project of collecting prom dresses, there is no clear inconsistency or evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided. The image could be used to evoke empathy and support for the cause mentioned in the text. Without additional context or evidence, there is no basis to conclude that the post contains misinformation.
Text:

Prediction:
The image shows a person who appears to be a politician or a public speaker, which could be consistent with a discussion or announcement about legislative matters such as the passing of a bill. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the claim made in the input text about the Kentucky House of Representatives approving free community college for certain students. Without additional context or evidence to suggest otherwise, there is no clear indication of misinformation based solely on the image and the text provided.
Text:
kid please reconsider is it really worth it to jump your broom wont work so what you didnt get the part youre young have so much to look forward to kid pls
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text seems to be a plea to a young person who is considering a dangerous act because they are upset about not getting a part in a play or a similar situation. It mentions a broom and implies that the person might be thinking irrationally about their ability to fly or escape their situation using a broom, which is not possible in reality.
The image shows a person who appears to be in a precarious situation on a bridge with emergency services present, likely trying to prevent the person from jumping. The text and the image are consistent in the sense that they both depict a scenario involving a person in a dangerous situation potentially considering harm.
However, the mention of a broom in the text introduces an element of fantasy or irrational thinking that is not corroborated by the image. The image does not show any broom or indicate that the person's distress is related to a fantasy about flying on a broom. Therefore, the text may contain misinformation or be misleading by suggesting that the person's distress is due to a failed attempt to use a broom to fly, which is not supported by the image. The image suggests a serious situation that requires intervention, while the text trivializes the scenario with a reference to a broom, which could be considered misinformation.
Text:
why the nigger is not fit to vote racist cartoon pamplhet by thomas nast arguing that african americans should not be able to vote date unknown usa racism political
Label: 1
Prediction: The image and the text both reference a racist cartoon by Thomas Nast, which is a historical artifact that reflects the racist attitudes and beliefs of its time. The cartoon itself is an example of racist propaganda that was used to argue against African American suffrage. The use of the derogatory term in the text and the content of the cartoon are consistent with each other in their historical context. However, the presentation of this content without proper context or explanation could be considered misinformation, as it perpetuates racist stereotypes and does not provide educational value or critical analysis of the historical significance and harmful impact of such imagery.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows two bears, with one in the foreground appearing to be licking its paw, which could be consistent with the behavior described as "licks his claws" in the text. The other bear is standing in the background, which might be interpreted as a wary view of the surroundings. There is no clear evidence of inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. The text describes behavior that could be expected from a bear that has been through trauma and is in a sanctuary, and the image does not contradict this description.
Text:
does brett kavanaughs legal essay donald trump should be allowed to commit crimes if he becomes president disqualify him from the supreme court
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a man who appears to be Brett Kavanaugh, a United States Supreme Court Justice. However, the claim made in the input text regarding a legal essay where Brett Kavanaugh supposedly states "Donald Trump should be allowed to commit crimes if he becomes president" is not accurate. Brett Kavanaugh has written extensively on the subject of presidential power and the law, but there is no record of an essay with the content as described in the input text. This claim seems to be a distortion or misrepresentation of Kavanaugh's views and writings. Therefore, the post contains misinformation.

Prediction: The image appears to be a historical etching that is consistent with the events described in the input text. It depicts a celebratory scene that could be related to the victory at the Battle of Salamanca, with figures toasting, which aligns with the mention of a toast being drunk to Wellington by England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. The style of the etching is in line with the period in question, and there are no obvious elements that contradict the text provided. Therefore, there is no clear indication of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.

news incredible discovery historians now believe that the egyptians finished the pyramids in like a week stretch where they were in the zone and it just flowed out of them
Label: 1
Prediction:
The claim that historians now believe the Egyptians finished the pyramids in a one-week stretch is misinformation. Historical and archaeological consensus is that the construction of the Egyptian pyramids, especially the large ones such as those at Giza shown in the image, took many years to complete. The Great Pyramid of Giza, for example, is estimated to have taken around 20 years to build, involving a large workforce and complex logistics. The image provided shows the pyramids, which are massive structures that would have been impossible to complete in such a short time frame given the technology and methods available during the era of their construction.
Text:
news playing the long game rolaids is saving up its advertising budget for the next years so it can buy up every single piece of ad space available in
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a scene that appears to be from a science fiction setting with futuristic vehicles and a cityscape that includes prominent advertising for Rolaids. The presence of such vehicles and the overall scene does not align with current reality and seems to be digitally altered or taken from a fictional context. The text claims that Rolaids is saving up its advertising budget to buy every single piece of ad space available in an unspecified location, but the image does not provide any verifiable evidence to support this claim. Instead, it seems to be an artistic or fictional representation, not a genuine depiction of an advertising strategy. Therefore, the inconsistency between the text and the image suggests that the post may contain misinformation.
Text:
i was born with an extra thumb and it was removed when i was a baby when the doctor was cutting into it he realised that my extra thumb was the one containing all the nerves and tendons and such so they had to put them all into my other thumb they also added some extra fat so i could grow into it
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a hand with a single thumb, which appears to be normal and without any visible signs of surgery or abnormalities that would suggest the presence of an extra thumb at birth or a complex surgical procedure as described in the text. The text claims that the individual was born with an extra thumb and that during its removal, the doctors discovered that the extra thumb contained all the nerves and tendons, which they then had to transfer to the other thumb. The image does not support this claim, as there is no evidence of such a significant medical history visible on the thumb shown. Therefore, the inconsistency between the text and the image suggests that misinformation may be present.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text is nonsensical and contains a series of unrelated phrases strung together without any logical coherence. It mentions the German defense minister, a frozen mammoth, blood found, and a burning home in Fresno, which are elements that do not logically connect in any factual scenario. The image provided is a mugshot of an individual, which does not corroborate or provide evidence for any of the claims made in the text. The inconsistency and lack of coherence between the text and the image suggest that the post contains misinformation.

Prediction:
The image shows a soccer player who appears to be Christian Pulisic, wearing a Borussia Dortmund jersey, celebrating during a soccer match. Although the image does not directly confirm the reunion with his dog or the involvement of Twitter and strangers in an act of kindness, it also does not contradict the text. There is no evidence in the image that directly disputes the claim made in the text, so we cannot conclude that there is misinformation based solely on the image provided.
Text:

Prediction:
The input text mentions several unrelated topics: the Trudeau government honoring fallen soldiers, access to Montreal's Mercier Bridge, the reopening of the bridge after an indigenous protest in Quebec, and Fraser school rankings. The image provided shows a person, presumably a woman, speaking at a podium with the European Union flag in the background. There is no clear connection between the text and the image, which suggests that the image does not complement or provide evidence for the text. The inconsistency between the text and the image indicates that the post may contain misinformation.

independence day of bosniaherzegovina marks the start of the civil war in memoriam nikola gardovic the first victim of the bosnian war a bosnian serb killed during a wedding procession in downtown sarajevo prosrpska
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text and the image claim that the Bosnian War started on March 1, which is also the Independence Day of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and that Nikola Gardović, a Bosnian Serb, was the first victim of the war, killed during a wedding procession. While it is true that the Bosnian War began in early April 1992 and that the shooting at the wedding of a Bosnian Serb occurred on March 1, 1992, the assertion that this event marks the start of the civil war is misleading. The war officially started after the international recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina as an independent state and the involvement of multiple armed factions. Therefore, the post simplifies and misrepresents the complex events that led to the war, which could lead to misinformation.

new zealanders deploy helicopters and thermal imaging to search for lost dogs thousands of dollars and hours have been spent on searches for beloved canines at least three times in the past year
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a dog wearing a vest, which could be a search dog or a rescued dog, and the logo of "The Guardian," which suggests that the image is from a news report by a reputable source. Although the image does not directly show helicopters or thermal imaging being used in searches, it is not uncommon for search and rescue operations to use such methods for finding lost pets. The text claims that New Zealanders have deployed helicopters and thermal imaging in searches for lost dogs, and the image does not contradict this claim. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and text provided.

Label: 1
Prediction: The image appears to be digitally altered, showing Jeb Bush's head on a body that may not be his, in a beach setting that looks artificial. This manipulation suggests that the scenario described in the text is likely fabricated or presented in a misleading manner.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The text describes someone's personal opinion that their aunt resembles the actress Bonnie Hunt and mentions a collage of photos comparing the two. The image provided is a collage of two women, one presumably the person's aunt and the other a young Bonnie Hunt. Since the text is subjective and the image is meant to illustrate the opinion, there is no claim of fact that can be verified as true or false. Therefore, there is no misinformation present based on the given text and image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a postcard with text written in different orientations, which is consistent with the input text's description of messages written perpendicularly. This practice was not uncommon historically, especially during times when paper was a more scarce or expensive resource, and people wanted to make the most of the space available on a postcard or letter. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided.

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows the logo of the apparel retailer bebe, which is consistent with the text stating that the retailer bebe is struggling and planning to shut all its stores. The image serves as a visual reference to the brand mentioned in the text. There is no direct evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image. However, without additional context or verification from reliable sources, I cannot definitively confirm the accuracy of the claim in the text.
Text:
when stephen colbert asked the postal service if they were going to make a second album jenny lewis and ben gibbard looked hopefully toward jimmy tamborello who just shook his head no
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided does not show the described scenario. It is an animated GIF that shows three individuals reacting to something off-camera, but there is no clear indication that this is a response to a question about making a second album, nor is there a clear indication that these individuals are Jenny Lewis, Ben Gibbard, and Jimmy Tamborello from The Postal Service. The image does not provide evidence for the text, and the lack of context in the image makes it impossible to confirm the text's claim. Therefore, the post could contain misinformation due to the inconsistency between the text and the image.
Text:
til that schrodinger did not want people to locations along the continental shelf while the other is an acronym it is an acronym completely automated public turing test to tell him
Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text is nonsensical and does not form a coherent statement. It mentions Schrödinger, who is known for his contributions to quantum mechanics, and then abruptly shifts to talking about locations along the continental shelf and an acronym related to a Turing test, without any clear connection or context. The image shows a collage of different scenes, likely from a cityscape and landmarks, which has no apparent relation to the text about Schrödinger, continental shelves, or a Turing test. The lack of coherence and relevance between the text and the image suggests that the post contains misinformation or is at least nonsensical and not informative.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text talks about someone's father in Vietnam, suggesting that the photo would be of a person, likely from the time of the Vietnam War. However, the image provided is of a car, specifically a model that resembles KITT from the 1980s television show "Knight Rider," which is inconsistent with the text. This discrepancy indicates that the image does not support the text, suggesting that there is misinformation in the post regarding the image being related to the text.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a bird's nest that has been built incorporating bird repelling spikes, which is consistent with the text's claim. The nest appears to be on the ground, as the text describes, and the presence of the spikes suggests that it was indeed built in a location meant to repel birds. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
facebook creator mark zuckerberg found face down and lifeless in a mall fountian witnesses say he was just trying to get the tiniest sip of water
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a small, unmanned, white capsule-like object in a fountain, not a person. There is no evidence in the image to support the claim that Mark Zuckerberg, or any individual, was found face down and lifeless in a mall fountain. The text appears to be a piece of misinformation, likely intended as a satirical or fictional statement, as it does not correlate with the content of the image.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text appears to be a distorted version of a quote from J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings," specifically from the character Éowyn. However, the text has been altered to include inappropriate content and references that are not present in the original work, such as "supple breasts" and "dark Nazi." The image provided shows the "Motherland Calls" statue in Volgograd, Russia, which is a monument commemorating the Battle of Stalingrad during World War II. The image has no direct connection to the content of the text, which is referencing a fantasy novel. The inconsistency between the text and the image, along with the altered quote, suggests that the post contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a crowded meeting room with numerous individuals, which could be consistent with a public meeting or a commission vote scenario. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the input text regarding the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Commission's decision. Without any clear evidence of inconsistency or misinformation, we cannot conclude that the post contains misinformation based on the image and the text provided.

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a stack of books, which could be consistent with the input text's description of a student's books for school. The text mentions that the books on the left are all English books for the upcoming form, and the books on the right are for the rest of the subjects. Although the image only shows one side of a shelf with books, there is no clear evidence to suggest that the text is providing misinformation. The image does not contradict the text, and without further context or evidence, there is no basis to claim misinformation. The text appears to be a personal statement about the individual's school books and does not make any verifiable claims that can be fact-checked against the image.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text and the image provided do not correlate with each other. The text seems to be a nonsensical statement mentioning Fortnite, airports, the Supreme Court, and reposting every two weeks, while the image is a simple comic strip about a character trying to be healthy but expressing love for pizza. There is no logical connection or consistency between the text and the image, suggesting that the post may contain misinformation or is at least not presenting a coherent message.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a drawing of a kitten on a wall amidst a scene of destruction, which aligns with the text's message. The text talks about highlighting the destruction in Gaza by posting photos, and the image complements this by showing a literal depiction of a kitten in a destroyed area, which could be a creative attempt to draw attention to the issue, as mentioned in the text. There is no clear indication of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
eli why does soaking your muscles in the diffrent versions of the body allow us to feel lower tones like deep bass in a road race than a fit person who has died wasnt a very low price as compared to my service provider
Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text is incoherent and does not form a logical statement. It seems to be a random collection of words that do not relate to each other in a meaningful way. The mention of soaking muscles, feeling lower tones like deep bass in a road race, and comparing the death of a fit person to service provider prices does not make sense together.
The image shows a person's hands operating what appears to be a musical device or electronic instrument, which has no clear connection to the text provided. The text talks about soaking muscles, feeling tones, and a comparison involving a service provider, none of which are depicted or implied by the image.
The lack of coherence in the text and the absence of a logical connection between the text and the image suggest that the post contains misinformation, as it fails to present a clear and consistent message.
Text:

The image shows a person holding up a quilt, with several other quilts visible in the foreground. This is consistent with the input text, which states that a group of ladies in Queensland, Australia have provided local cops with rescue quilts for children and trauma victims.

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows fruits and vegetables packaged in plastic, which contradicts the claim made in the input text that Sainsbury's has removed plastic for its loose fruit, vegetables, and bakery items. The presence of plastic packaging in the image suggests that the text's statement about the reduction of plastic usage may not be accurate, indicating potential misinformation.
Text:
australian native magnolia maymuru selected as the northern territory representative for the miss world national finals from yirrkala to the catwalk
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a young woman being fitted for a dress, which is consistent with activities one might expect for a participant in a beauty pageant such as Miss World. The setting appears to be a backstage or preparation area, which aligns with the context of the text stating that Magnolia Maymuru has been selected as a representative for the Miss World national finals. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text, and the image seems to support the narrative that she is involved in pageant-related activities. Therefore, there is no clear indication of misinformation based on the image and text provided.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a courtroom sketch with the caption "Salmonella Sentencing," which is consistent with the input text regarding a sentencing related to tainted peanut butter that caused illnesses. The term "Salmonella" is commonly associated with foodborne illnesses, which aligns with the context of the text about peanut butter linked to sickness and deaths. The image supports the text, and there is no clear indication of misinformation based on the provided content.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction: The image does not match the description provided in the input text. The text describes a homemade summer appetizer plate with watermelon, arugula, hash browns, folded eggs with spinach, red pepper, and honey puff pastry shells. However, the image shows what appears to be ice cream sandwiches with a pink outer layer and colorful sprinkles on top, which does not correspond to any of the food items listed in the text. Therefore, there is a discrepancy between the text and the image, indicating misinformation.
Text:
a beautiful reunion this high school football player got the surprise of a lifetime when he removed his helmet to reveal that he was his father who had been fighting in afghanistan for the past years
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text describes a scenario where a high school football player removes his helmet to find out that he is actually his father, who has been away fighting in Afghanistan. The image shows a football player among his teammates, but there is no evidence of a reunion or a surprise reveal of the player being someone's father. The description in the text is not logically consistent with the image, as it is not possible for someone to literally be their own father, and the image does not depict any sort of reunion. Therefore, this post contains misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided is the logo of Yahoo!, which does not confirm or contradict the information given in the text.

Prediction:
The image shows a person standing in front of a building with "The Guardian" logo, which suggests that the image is related to a news report from The Guardian, a reputable news source. There is no direct contradiction between the text and the image that would indicate misinformation. The text discusses a policy change in Wales regarding smoking bans in certain outdoor areas, and the image does not provide any specific evidence to refute this claim. Without further context or evidence to suggest that the text is false, we cannot conclude that the post contains misinformation based on the image provided.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a young man wearing a Sporting Lisbon jersey with the name "Martunis" on it, standing next to a woman. The jersey and the context are consistent with the claim in the text that the individual was signed by the football club Sporting Lisbon. The presence of the Sporting Lisbon logo and the name on the jersey corroborate the text's information about the individual's association with the football club. There is no evident discrepancy between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation.

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text and the image provided do not correlate with each other. The text seems to be a disjointed set of thoughts that includes a personal realization about a shipping address, a mention of moving to California, a business owner paying bills, and an inappropriate reference to personal items. The image, on the other hand, shows a football player in a game setting, which has no apparent connection to the text. The inconsistency between the text and the image suggests that the post may contain misinformation or is nonsensical, as there is no coherent message being conveyed when both are taken together.
Text:
when democratic socialists think they have the right direction im just sitting here waiting for this video i see that even an srs sub has fallen so badly
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image features a character from the children's animated series "Masha and the Bear" with a caption that reads "Comrade Masha summons the specter of communism." This appears to be a satirical or humorous image, likely edited to include the caption for comedic effect. The input text seems to express a sentiment about democratic socialists and a decline in the quality of a subreddit discussion, possibly implying a disagreement with their political stance. The image does not provide any factual evidence or context that would directly support or refute the claim in the text. Instead, it seems to be used to mock or satirize the concept of socialism or communism. Therefore, the post may contain misinformation as the image does not substantiate the text's claim and is likely used for humorous or satirical purposes rather than as a serious commentary on political ideologies.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a surgical procedure, which is consistent with the context of organ transplants mentioned in the input text. There is no direct evidence in the image to suggest misinformation regarding the new technique described in the text. The claim about a new technique that allows organ transplant recipients to avoid taking anti-rejection medicines by infusing donor cells before the operation could be a legitimate medical advancement. Without further evidence to contradict the claim, the image does not provide a basis to determine the presence of misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided appears to be a screenshot from a television show or movie, with a character exclaiming a controversial statement that is unrelated to the input text about Papa John Schnatter and his company's sales or conference calls. The text in the image is provocative and does not correlate with the context of the input text, suggesting that the image has been either taken out of context or manipulated to create a misleading narrative. Therefore, this post likely contains misinformation due to the inconsistency and irrelevance between the text and the image.
Text:

Prediction:
The image shows a man who appears to be giving an interview or recounting an experience. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text provided. The text speaks about a positive action taken by a boss towards an employee with a medical condition, and the image does not provide any evidence to suggest that this did not happen. Without additional context or evidence to the contrary, there is no clear indication of misinformation based solely on the image and the text provided.

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image has been digitally altered to include the face of a known political leader on a character from a scene that appears to be from the movie "The Hangover." The text seems to be a jumbled mix of phrases that could relate to various movie plots but does not provide a coherent statement or context. The combination of the nonsensical text and the altered image suggests that the post is likely to contain misinformation or is intended as a satirical or humorous piece rather than a factual report.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a person wearing a badge that appears to be related to the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), which is consistent with the text mentioning DSA members in Iowa. The text discusses the perspective of some DSA members on socialism and their political goals, and the image complements this by depicting an individual who could plausibly be a member of the organization. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows two strollers with babies, where one baby is being given a lollipop and the other is looking at itself in a mirror. This illustration seems to metaphorically support the input text, which discusses the concept that excessive praise can foster narcissistic qualities in children. The lollipop could symbolize the "sweet" praise or rewards from parents, and the mirror could represent self-admiration or narcissism. There is no direct evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
step right up and feast your eyes on the unfathomable comey the man who is both good and bad the beautiful monster who makes resisters minds spin betrayer of hillary enemy of trump behold this freak of nature
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text provided is highly opinionated and uses sensational language to describe a person, referring to them as "the unfathomable," "the beautiful monster," and a "freak of nature." This language is emotionally charged and seems designed to provoke a strong reaction rather than provide factual information. The image shows an individual in a professional setting, which does not inherently support or refute the claims made in the text. However, the use of such language in the text is indicative of a biased or potentially misleading portrayal, which could be considered misinformation, especially if it is intended to manipulate public perception without factual basis. Without additional context to verify the claims made in the text, it is reasonable to suspect that the post may contain misinformation.
Text:

Prediction:
The image provided is a logo or masthead for "The State Journal" from Frankfort, KY, which does not corroborate the text's claim about two boys in Louisville helping to fight gun violence. The image does not show any individuals, let alone boys who have been shot and are now activists. Therefore, there is a discrepancy between the text and the image, suggesting that the post may contain misinformation.

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a vintage photograph of a soldier, which is consistent with the historical context of the text. The text mentions descendants of a South Australian farmer who fought in WWI, and the image could reasonably be a photograph of that soldier. There is no clear inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not show any evidence of a catastrophic event, cholera outbreak, or any connection to the Bethlem Royal Hospital insane asylum. It appears to be a photograph of a well-presented dish, which includes a glass of a beverage, a half lemon, and a decorative food item on a plate. There is no indication that this image is related to the text's claim about a cooking program leading to deaths from cholera. The content of the image does not support the severity of the situation described in the text, suggesting a discrepancy that could indicate misinformation.
Text:

The image complements the text by providing a visual representation of the animal that the proposed parliamentary bill aims to protect.
Text:
my dad right and my uncle left having a snowball fight in i cherish this picture because they havent spoken in decades due to a family altercation
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not show two individuals having a snowball fight. Instead, it appears to be a still from a science fiction movie or television show, featuring two characters dressed in futuristic costumes and holding what seem to be prop weapons. This is inconsistent with the claim in the text about a personal photograph of a family snowball fight. Therefore, the post contains misinformation as the image does not support the text.
Text:
halftone handtinted post card intended for south america reads translated from croatian yet yesterday the force responsible for the blockade is already alone and blocked one handle of the pliers reads norwaydenmark and the other reads belgiumhollandfrance c
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a pair of pliers with the Nazi swastika symbol on it, gripping a group of land masses that represent countries. The text on the pliers reads "NORVÉSKA DANSKA" (Norwegian Danish) on one handle and "BELGIJAD HOLANDSKA FRANCUSKA" (Belgium Holland France) on the other, which is consistent with the translated text provided. The image appears to be a piece of historical propaganda, likely from the World War II era, illustrating the Nazi grip on these countries. The text and image are consistent with each other, depicting the message that the force (Nazi Germany) which was once enforcing a blockade is now itself isolated or blocked. There is no direct evidence of misinformation in the text or the image, as they seem to be a historical artifact rather than a contemporary news report or post. However, without additional context about the source and purpose of the post, it is difficult to definitively determine the presence of misinformation. The assessment is based solely on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a group of people, presumably US senators, with a sign stating "WE WILL FORCE VOTE #FreeAndOpenInternet," which aligns with the input text's message about the US Senate's efforts to reverse the FCC's net neutrality ruling. The sign suggests a push for action, which is consistent with the text's implication that there is ongoing political effort to address the issue. There is no direct evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
the nepalese army rescued a monthold baby who miraculously survived the weekend earthquake and subsequently spent at least hours buried in rubble
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a scene of destruction that is consistent with the aftermath of an earthquake, which supports the text's claim about an earthquake. There are people sitting amidst the rubble, which could indicate that rescue operations may have been taking place in the area. However, the image does not specifically show a baby being rescued or the Nepalese army in action. The absence of these specific details in the image does not necessarily indicate misinformation, as the text could be describing an event that is not visually documented in the provided image. Therefore, based on the information given, there is no clear evidence of misinformation.
Text:
cal state university la offers segregated housing to shield black students from microaggressions and to give them a space that is inclusive and nondiscriminatory
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided is a general view of the Cal State LA campus and does not confirm or refute the claim made in the text regarding segregated housing. To determine the accuracy of the claim, additional context or evidence would be required, such as official statements from the university or documentation of the housing policies. Without such evidence, the image does not validate the claim, and the information could potentially be misleading or incomplete. Therefore, based on the image alone, we cannot confirm the accuracy of the text, and it is possible that misinformation exists.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The claim that "Jeopardy!" is changing its traditional opening to include a section where Alex Trebek asks contestants if they've ever cheated on their spouses is misinformation. "Jeopardy!" is a well-known quiz show that focuses on general knowledge questions, and its format does not include personal questions about the contestants' private lives. Additionally, Alex Trebek, the host pictured in the image, passed away in 2020, and the show has continued with different guest hosts and a new permanent host since then. The text's claim does not align with the known format of the show or the current state of its hosting.
Text:

Prediction:
The image shows individuals who appear to be manually mining or sifting through material, which is consistent with activities that might take place in mines. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the claim made in the input text regarding the control of mines in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Without additional context or evidence to suggest otherwise, there is no clear indication of misinformation based solely on the image and the text provided.
Text:
putin says russia backs free syrian army pushes to recapture mosul will be marginalized by the year after parliament passed a vote of no religion now outnumber christians in syria
Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text is incoherent and seems to be a jumble of unrelated statements. It mentions Putin and Russia's stance on the Free Syrian Army, a push to recapture Mosul, a vote by a parliament on religion, and a claim about religious demographics in Syria. The image, however, shows a group of children with stuffed animals, possibly at some sort of event or demonstration, with a BBC News logo indicating it is a news image. There is no clear connection between the text and the image, and the image does not provide any evidence or context that would support the text. The inconsistency and lack of coherence suggest that the post may contain misinformation.
Text:
bbc tells star science presenter brian cox that impromptu extraterrestrial contact would break health and safety guidelines stop him using jodrell bank to listen to possible candidate for alien life on live stargazing programme
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a person who appears to be Brian Cox, with a logo of "The Guardian" and a timestamp from "2012." This suggests that the image is from a news article or report from The Guardian in 2012. However, without the ability to verify the current policies of the BBC or the specific incident mentioned in the text, it is not possible to definitively determine the accuracy of the claim. The image itself does not provide any evidence to support or refute the claim made in the text. Therefore, based on the lack of verifiable information and the inability to cross-reference the claim with the image, the prediction is that misinformation may exist.

Prediction:
The image shows a woman in swimwear looking out at the ocean, which is consistent with the text describing a scenario where a triathlon competitor, presumably someone who is comfortable in swimwear and around water, rescues a couple from drowning. The setting appears to be a beach, which aligns with the location mentioned in the text (Cancun). There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a windmill with the text "The Dykes blowin in the wind" overlaid on it, which corresponds to the description in the input text. The text mentions making a mix CD cover after moving to the Netherlands, and the image of the windmill is consistent with typical Dutch scenery. There is no clear indication of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
audience members complained when an abba fan with dementia sang along to mamma mia so a cinema put on a private screening for the woman and other dementia patients where she could sing as loudly as she wanted
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a group of people in a cinema, and the presence of the BBC News logo suggests that it is a legitimate news story. The image is consistent with the kind of event described in the text, where a private screening might be organized for dementia patients. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text, and the image appears to be a genuine representation of a group of people who could be involved in such an event. Therefore, there is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided.
Text:
hawaii is now the th state in the country with a law that prohibits therapists from offering socalled conversion therapy to minors the new law signed by the governor friday applies to psychiatrists social workers counselors and marriage and family therapists
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a person who appears to be a governor signing a document in a ceremonial setting, surrounded by other individuals who may be witnesses or supporters of the action. The setting includes a seal that suggests a governmental context, consistent with the signing of a law. The text states that Hawaii has passed a law prohibiting conversion therapy for minors, and the image is consistent with the signing of such a law. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a robotic device with a tablet and what appears to be a camera attached to a mechanical arm, which is consistent with the description provided in the input text. The text talks about a "tablet on a stick extending robot" that can assist with traffic stops, and the image complements this by showing such a device. There is no clear indication of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
pakistans supreme court exonerated a man convicted of blasphemy after he served nine years of a life sentence in prison a twojudge panel of the court ruled on friday that mohammad mansha was falsely accused citing lack of evidence
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows the logo of "The Washington Post" with the tagline "Democracy Dies in Darkness," which is a legitimate newspaper known for reporting on various topics, including international news. The text describes a legal decision made by Pakistan's Supreme Court. There is no direct inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. The image does not provide specific evidence to confirm or refute the text's claims, but the use of a reputable news outlet's logo could imply that the information comes from a credible source. However, without further context or the ability to verify the current news from "The Washington Post," we cannot conclusively determine the accuracy of the text. The assessment is based solely on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
a year old child who had his bike violently stolen ribs broken and was left by the side of the road has had over ps raised by redditors to replace the one he had saved over months to buy
Label: 0
Prediction:
The text and the image contain inconsistencies that suggest misinformation may be present. The text mentions a "year old child" but the image shows a fundraising campaign for a "young man." Additionally, the text states that over "ps" were raised, which is unclear, but the image shows that £1,413 have been raised, which does not match any typical denomination of currency related to "ps." Furthermore, the image's description of the fundraising goal is £601, which is inconsistent with the amount mentioned in the text. These discrepancies indicate that the information provided in the text does not accurately reflect the content of the image.
Text:
a while ago there was one of those government weapon testing things in the sky and i took a pic later i was messing with faceswap on snapchat and it tried to swap my face with it and i looked back at it and realized it looked like there was a face in it
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a phenomenon in the sky that resembles a cloud or explosion with bright lights, which could be consistent with some sort of aerial event or test. However, the claim that a face can be recognized in it and that a face-swapping application attempted to swap faces with it is highly subjective and likely a result of pareidolia, which is a tendency for humans to see familiar patterns, like faces, in random stimuli. The text suggests that the image contains a face that was recognized by software, but this is not verifiable and could easily be misinformation, especially if it is implying that the face is somehow related to the government weapon testing. Without further evidence, the claim about the face recognition by the software and its connection to the event in the sky is dubious and likely misinformation.
Text:
life inspiring this shelter helps women leave their abusive husbands by training them to pull off the greatest casino heist vegas has ever seen
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that a shelter helps women leave their abusive husbands by training them to perform a major casino heist in Vegas, which is an implausible and unrealistic scenario for a legitimate shelter's operation. The image shows two individuals in a vault which could be suggestive of a heist scene, but it does not provide credible evidence that such a shelter exists or that it trains women to commit crimes. The scenario described in the text is more akin to a plot of a fictional story or movie rather than a factual report. Therefore, the post is likely to contain misinformation.
Text:
humor my experimental radical feminist and pedophile advocate alison rapp fired after posting about freedom of expression factsnot feelings gamers and video games but judge dredd was including them over a failed movie
Label: 1
Prediction: The text and the image provided do not align in content, which suggests misinformation. The text mentions an individual named Alison Rapp and discusses topics such as radical feminism, pedophile advocacy, freedom of expression, gamers, video games, and Judge Dredd in relation to a failed movie. However, the image shows a series of messages from the Reddit platform, specifically from the subreddit /r/australia, where a user is discussing their ban from the subreddit due to alleged racism and hate speech, as well as their opinions on transgender people. There is no mention of Alison Rapp, radical feminism, pedophile advocacy, freedom of expression in the context of gaming, or Judge Dredd in the image. The content of the image is entirely unrelated to the input text, indicating that the post containing both the text and the image is likely spreading misinformation by pairing unrelated content.
Text:
at my work theres a soda machine that goes till nr i pressed and this is what i saw that unexistant soda can is quite expensive normal price lays around euro oc
Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a vending machine with a digital display indicating a price of €320,00, which is highly unusual and exorbitant for a soda can. The normal price for a soda is indeed around a few euros, as mentioned in the input text. The display likely indicates an error or a malfunction in the vending machine system rather than the actual price of the soda. Therefore, the post does not contain misinformation per se, but the image shows an anomaly that is being highlighted by the text, which is accurate in stating that the price displayed is not the normal price for a soda.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a building that appears to be part of a higher education institution, which is relevant to the topic of the input text discussing the state of higher education. There is no direct contradiction or inconsistency between the text and the image that would indicate misinformation. The text claims that there are critiques of higher education, and the image simply shows a higher education institution without any specific claims or evidence that would confirm or deny the text's statement. Therefore, based on the information provided, there is no clear indication of misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a wooden contraption which appears to be a pedal-operated device, possibly a sewing machine or a spinning wheel. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text, which suggests the author is confused about an unusual object found under a piano in an Airbnb. The text does not make any factual claims that can be verified as true or false against the image, it merely expresses the author's lack of knowledge about the object. Therefore, there is no clear misinformation present.
Text:
so i gave a womans post about a variety of topics i am applying for political reasons chuckles in lesbian me to a very interesting dream about my declining fertility are fucking everywhere
Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text is incoherent and does not seem to relate to the image provided. The text appears to be a random collection of thoughts or phrases without a clear message or context. The image shows a split comparison between a mirrored image of a woman's face and a photo of Donald Trump, with a caption about facial symmetry. There is no logical connection between the text and the image, and the text does not provide any content that could be verified or debunked based on the image. Therefore, the post is likely to contain misinformation due to the nonsensical and unrelated nature of the text in relation to the image.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text is incoherent and does not form a logical statement. It seems to be a string of unrelated phrases mashed together, which does not provide any clear information or context that can be verified against the image. The image shows a plate of what appears to be zucchini fritters with a side of sauce, which has no apparent connection to the text provided. The lack of coherence and context in the text, combined with an unrelated image, suggests that the post may contain misinformation or is nonsensical.
Text:
this is a very weird vhs tape that starts out relatively innocent and gets more and more heavy handed antievolution antibarcodes antitechnologys
Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided does not offer any clear evidence to support the claim that the VHS tape in question contains content that is anti-evolution, anti-barcodes, or anti-technology. The image shows two individuals, one in the foreground and one blurred in the background, in what appears to be an outdoor setting. There are no visible elements related to the themes mentioned in the text, such as technology, barcodes, or anything related to the concept of evolution. Without additional context or evidence, the image does not corroborate the claims made in the text, and thus it is not possible to determine the accuracy of the text based on the image alone. Therefore, the prediction of misinformation is based on the lack of visual evidence in the image to support the text's claims.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a house with a rosebush in front of it. The rosebush appears healthy and is blooming, which is consistent with the claim made in the input text that the rosebush blooms despite the house being abandoned and without receiving much attention. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the image and the text provided.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a dog that appears to be inside a vehicle, lying on some white fabric. The dog has a visible large mass on its side, which could be consistent with the description of a tumor mentioned in the text. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text provided. Therefore, based on the information given, there is no clear evidence of misinformation between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a crowd of football fans holding up a banner that pays tribute to the victims of a tragedy, which is consistent with the input text stating that Sunderland fans raised money to honor MH victims who were supporters of rival Newcastle. The presence of "The Guardian" logo and the year "2014" suggests that this is a genuine news image, which supports the authenticity of the event described. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a man holding a backpack with a plush beluga toy attached to it. This visual evidence is consistent with the input text, which states that a father brings his daughter's toy to work every day as a reminder of his family. There is nothing in the image to suggest that this is misinformation. The image complements the text and appears to be a genuine representation of the story described.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows two gold vinyl records with album covers visible in the background. The album on the left is titled "Friends and Family" and the one on the right is "Sun Machine" by Rubblebucket. Both album covers feature logos that are indeed similar, with an eye-like design. The text describes two gold vinyls from different bands with similar logos, which is consistent with the image. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
when they did another ultrasound a few weeks later they discovered that i had absorbed the other fetus do i regret this no i believe his tissue has made me stronger i now have the strength of a grown cat and a little kitten
Label: 1
Prediction: The text claims that the person absorbed another fetus and as a result, now has the strength of a grown cat and a little kitten. This statement is scientifically implausible and suggests a misunderstanding of biology, as absorbing another fetus would not confer the physical characteristics or strengths of a different species. The image provided appears to be digitally altered or manipulated to show a person with feline features, which is not possible in reality and is likely intended to be humorous or satirical. The inconsistency between the text's claim and the reality of human and animal biology, along with the manipulated image, indicates that this post contains misinformation.
Text:
the hour is approaching when the red army together with the armies of our allies will break the back of the fascist beast kukryniksy soviet union
Label: 1
Prediction: The text appears to be a historical statement regarding the Red Army and its allies' efforts during World War II to defeat the Axis powers, which included Nazi Germany (often referred to as the "fascist beast"). The image is a propaganda poster that visually represents this sentiment, with the flags of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union converging on a caricatured beast representing the Axis powers. The text on the image matches the input text, suggesting that the image and text are consistent with each other and there is no evidence of misinformation based on the provided content.
Text:
boys removed from horrific christian camp in texas boys ages were removed from joshua home in bertram following reports of abuse neglect labor violations fraud licencing violations and human trafficking
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided does not seem to be directly related to the serious allegations mentioned in the input text. The image shows a silhouette of a person holding balloons with the word "patheos" overlaid, which appears to be more of a generic inspirational or branding image rather than evidence or a complement to a report about a Christian camp involved in abuse, neglect, and other violations. The lack of a relevant image to support the serious nature of the text suggests that there may be misinformation present, as the image does not corroborate the claims made in the text.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image shows a man standing in front of a TGI Fridays restaurant, which is consistent with the text that mentions a family waiting for a table at TGI Fridays. There is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image. The text describes a situation that could be subjective or opinion-based (the dad facing backlash for a decision), and the image does not contradict this scenario.
Text:
after decades of bad news about worsening obesity rates especially among children there seems to be some good news coming out of leeds and other deprived areas of england where programs put in place over the last years have had measurable success in reducing childhood obesity rates
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a child holding a plate of carrot sticks, which can be associated with healthy eating habits. The text talks about a positive development in reducing childhood obesity rates, particularly in Leeds and other deprived areas of England, due to programs implemented over the years. The image complements the text by depicting a healthier food choice, which aligns with the message of improving children's health. There is no direct inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. However, without additional context or data, it is not possible to verify the accuracy of the claim regarding the success of the programs mentioned. The image itself does not contradict the text.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows an umbrella hanging in a shower, which is consistent with the text describing a scenario where the person finds an umbrella in the bathroom after their daughter had a shower. There is no indication of misinformation as the image complements the text and the scenario described is plausible and humorous, rather than being based on factual claims that could be true or false.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image supports the text provided. It shows a progression of a young boy, an image of him with burn injuries, and finally, him as a firefighter. This visual progression aligns with the story of someone who was a burn victim as a child and later became a firefighter, overcoming his past trauma with fire. There is no evident inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation.
Text:
the brisbane massacre of where the emu wehrmacht slaughtered approximately defenseless australian men women and children in cold blood it was only one of many such atrocities committed by the emus during the great emu war
Label: 1
Prediction: The text claims a "Brisbane massacre" during the "Great Emu War" where emus are said to have slaughtered people, which is historically inaccurate and presents a false narrative. The Great Emu War was a nuisance wildlife management military operation undertaken in Australia to address public concern over the number of emus said to be destroying crops in Western Australia. No humans were killed in this operation. The image provided is clearly doctored, combining a historical photograph of children running (which is unrelated to emus or any such massacre) with the superimposed head of an emu, which is meant to be humorous rather than factual. The image and text together are designed to mislead and are an example of misinformation.
Text:
back in i was brousing through the personal finance section in barnes and noble and came across these two piles of trash good reminder of the old mantra that if it sounds too good to be true it probably is beware of hucksters selling get rich quick schemes
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows two books with titles that suggest financial advice or strategies, presumably authored by Jim Cramer. The text refers to these books as "piles of trash" and implies they are part of "get rich quick schemes." The image alone does not provide evidence to support the claim that these books are indeed "trash" or that they are misleading in any way. The text seems to express a personal opinion rather than stating a fact. However, without additional context or evidence to support the claim that these books are part of a scheme, the post could potentially spread misinformation by discrediting the books based solely on the opinion expressed in the text.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The text refers to Peter Wang, a JROTC cadet and a recipient of the Medal of Heroism, and mentions West Point posthumously admitting him, which is a claim that could be verified. However, the image provided shows a sailing boat on the ocean at sunset, which has no apparent connection to the text about Peter Wang or West Point. The image does not complement or provide evidence for the text, suggesting a lack of consistency between the text and the image. Therefore, this post may contain misinformation due to the mismatch between the text content and the accompanying image.
Text:
complete disaster this middle school had a sex ed assembly about the importance of microwaving condoms before and after intercourse and the guest speaker tried to break a cinder block with his head and gave himself a concussion
Label: 1
Prediction:
The text claims that a middle school sex ed assembly included advice on microwaving condoms and featured a guest speaker attempting to break a cinder block with his head, resulting in a concussion. The image shows a person lying on the ground next to a cinder block and a microwave on a cart, with a "SEXUAL EDUCATION" banner in the background. While the image does seem to depict a scene related to sexual education and an incident involving a cinder block, the claim about microwaving condoms before and after intercourse is not supported by any credible sexual education guidelines and is medically unsound, suggesting misinformation. Additionally, the scenario described is highly unusual and implausible, which further indicates that the post is likely to contain misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image provided is of a man who appears to be Devin Nunes, a known political figure. However, the image itself does not confirm the content of the alleged secret audio recording or the plans of the GOP caucus regarding Rod Rosenstein. The claim made in the text is specific and would require additional evidence, such as audio or credible reporting, to verify its accuracy. The image alone does not provide this evidence and therefore cannot be used to validate the claim. Without additional context or verification, the post could potentially contain misinformation.
Text:

Prediction:
The image provided shows a person who appears to be a political figure with the flag of Venezuela in the background. This does not correlate with the text, which discusses a collaboration between China's Ministry of Commerce and the province of Cienfuegos in Cuba regarding solar energy generation. The presence of the Venezuelan flag and the individual who seems to be associated with Venezuela suggests a lack of consistency between the text and the image, indicating that the post may contain misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction: The input text is incoherent and seems to be a random collection of phrases that do not form a logical narrative. It mentions an ancient Portuguese shipwreck, a holiday park, China and India at the UN, shares, and positions in northern Syria, all in one sentence without any clear connection or context. The image shows a number of television screens displaying a news broadcast from BBC News featuring an image of Vladimir Putin. There is no visible connection between the text and the image, which suggests that the post is likely to contain misinformation due to the lack of coherence and relevance between the text and the accompanying image.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a person who appears to be Donald Trump, and the text refers to companies joining hands against a travel ban that was implemented during Trump's presidency. The image is consistent with the context of the text, as it depicts the person whose policy is being discussed. There is no direct evidence of misinformation based on the image and text provided. However, without additional context or verification of the claims made in the text, it is not possible to definitively determine the accuracy of the information. The assessment is based solely on the consistency between the image and the text.
Text:
actual footage of me at the party and youre months apart my partner says he still cant take the two days in my entire day arguing with a new city and i havent had sex in months
Label: 1
Prediction:
The input text appears to be a disjointed collection of thoughts or statements that do not form a coherent narrative. It mentions being at a party, arguing in a city, and personal relationship details, which have no clear connection to each other or to the image provided.
The image is a comic strip that humorously contrasts "how normal people apply chapstick" with "how I apply chapstick." It does not provide any evidence or context that would relate to the text, nor does it complement the text in a way that would make the post informative or factual.
The lack of coherence and relevance between the text and the image suggests that the post may contain misinformation, as it does not present a clear or truthful message. The text and image do not support each other, and the post seems to be nonsensical rather than informative.
Text:
my sons old dried up playdough firmed perfect little salt crystals that white thing is a square crystal with light hitting it hes now mining with a toothpick
Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows a close-up of what appears to be a dried-up substance with various colors and some crystal-like structures on it. The presence of a shiny, square-shaped crystal with light reflecting off of it is consistent with the description provided in the input text. Playdough, when mixed with salt and left to dry, can sometimes form crystal-like structures due to the salt crystallizing. The text claims that the child is using a toothpick to 'mine' these formations, which is a plausible activity for a child to engage in with old playdough. There is nothing in the image that directly contradicts the text, and the scenario described is plausible, so there is no clear evidence of misinformation based on the provided content.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows the logo of Bloomberg, which is a reputable global information and technology company that provides financial news and information. The presence of the Bloomberg logo suggests that the image is associated with a news report from this organization. The text discusses a legal ruling in New York regarding hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and mentions the state's highest court and the governor's decision on a moratorium. There is no inherent inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation. The text appears to be a factual statement about a legal decision, and the image of the Bloomberg logo is appropriate for a news report on such a topic. Without further context or evidence to the contrary, there is no reason to suspect misinformation based solely on the text and image provided.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a staircase with steps that have labels indicating the amount of calories burned and the number of seconds added to one's life, which corresponds with the description provided in the input text. There is no evidence of misinformation based on the consistency between the text and the image.

Prediction: The image shows a bathroom with a transparent glass floor through which an elevator shaft can be seen. There is indeed a red balloon floating up the shaft, which is consistent with the description in the input text. There is no direct evidence of a child laughing in the image, but the presence of the red balloon aligns with the narrative provided. Therefore, there is no clear indication of misinformation based solely on the consistency between the text and the image.
Text:
blog the fact that an explosive robot was used to kill the dallas shooter raises disturbing concerns about the fucking rad militarization of the police
Label: 1
Prediction: The image shows a bomb disposal robot, which is consistent with the type of equipment that might be used by police forces. However, without additional context or verification, it is not possible to confirm whether this specific robot was used to kill a shooter, as the text claims. The text expresses an opinion about the militarization of police, which is a subjective statement and cannot be fact-checked based on the image alone. However, the use of the phrase "fucking rad" in the text is unprofessional and could indicate a biased or non-factual source, which raises the possibility of misinformation.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction:
The image provided shows a toy figure, specifically a Spider-Man action figure, lying on the ground. This image does not correlate with the serious nature of the text, which discusses leaked FBI documents and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy (JFK). The inconsistency between the text and the image suggests that the post contains misinformation, as a toy figure would not be credible evidence to support a claim regarding historical events of such significance.
Text:

Label: 1
Prediction: The image shows a tattoo that appears to be a stylized depiction of a character with a surprised expression, which could be interpreted as the "very shocked little dude" mentioned in the input text. There are also elements in the tattoo that could resemble flowers, which aligns with the text's description. There is no clear indication of a broken coconut, but the abstract nature of tattoos can lead to different interpretations of the design. The image seems to be consistent with the text's description of the tattoo, and there is no evidence of misinformation based on the provided content.

Label: 0
Prediction: The image shows a healthy-looking section of a coral reef, which could be part of the Great Barrier Reef. The text talks about coral bleaching due to warming sea temperatures, which is a known issue for coral reefs globally, including the Great Barrier Reef. However, the image does not directly contradict the text since it does not show bleached coral. The text also mentions coral transplant technology, which is a real method being explored to help damaged reefs recover. There is no clear inconsistency between the text and the image that would indicate misinformation.
Text:

Label: 0
Prediction:
The image shows two individuals who appear to be a child and an adult. The adult is wearing casual clothing and a cap, and there is no clear indication that the adult has painted on facial hair. The image does not provide evidence of the adult being a single mom dressed as a dad, as claimed in the text. Without additional context or verification, the image does not confirm the story presented in the text, which could suggest that the post contains misinformation. However, it's important to note that the lack of visual evidence in the image does not conclusively prove that the text is false; it simply means that the image does not substantiate the claim.
