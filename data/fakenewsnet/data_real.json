        "post_text": "Bellamy Young Opens Up About Being Adopted, Her Real First Name and How She Almost Missed Out on 'Scandal' Bellamy Young may be riveting as First Lady Mellie Grant on ABC’s Scandal, but her off-screen story is just as captivating. “I was adopted, so I was in foster care for six weeks,” the actress, 45, says in the latest issue of PEOPLE. “We only had two lines on my dad and a paragraph on my mom. It said she loved to sing, so my mom who raised me would find any way to let me perform.” Young says she spent her youth in Asheville, North Carolina, learning ballet and tap dancing and performing at school and church. After graduating from Yale, Young – who grew up with the first name Amy – spent a few years doing theater in New York before making the move to Los Angeles in 2000 to pursue TV and film work. “When I went to join the Screen Actors Guild, there was already an Amy Young so I had to register under a different name,” says Young. “I tried to become Susanna or Violet or something fabulous, but it just didn’t feel like I could carry the ruse off.”\n    \n        So the actress turned to her family for inspiration.\n    \n        “My first [adoptive] dad died when I was 15, and his best friend, Bill, did all the dad stuff with me, so I did a mushing of our names,” Young says. “I felt like I could get away with it because I’m Southern.”\n    \n        After years of hopping from project to project, Young was given the opportunity to audition for the role of Mellie on Scandal. The character only had a few lines in the pilot episode, but Young says she showed up at the first table read for the season excited to work.\n    \n        “[Creator Shonda Rhimes] came around afterward and told everyone what their arc would be for that first season. She got to me, and I was so happy. Then she told me she thought I’d be in about three episodes. She wanted to write a presidential divorce,” Young recalls.\n    \n        “I died inside when I heard that. But I kept a smile on my face and showed up to work every day. At some point, they decided it was fun to write stuff for me,” continues Young, who has also released an album of cover songs called Far Away So Close. “I’m having such a good time. I don’t want it to ever end.”",

Lydia returned to the SoCal crew in Season 12 after having previously spent some time on the show back in Season 8. “RHOC has given me a great platform and I’m grateful for that. However, I feel like I can only handle this show one season at a time,” she wrote in a blog post on Friday (February 9). “I need a break! There is a lot of good that comes from the show, but also a lot of negativity. After a family vote, it was unanimous that I should take a break. Sometimes the people who love us the most see things even we don’t see. I trust my path and I’m excited for what the future holds.”\n        When Season 12 wrapped up, Lydia and her husband, Doug, revealed that they were mulling over plans for them to possibly expand their family with a daughter (more on that in the video below). They are already parents to three sons. In reflecting on her sophomore season on the show, she shared, \"I feel like last time I was with this group of women, I just really observed and I didnt necessarily speak my mind. And this time around, I feel like I really was able to stick up for myself and voice my opinion and I'm proud of myself for that.\"\n        This past season, in addition to watching Lydia's home life with her husband and three kids, fans also got to know her mom, Judy Stirling, a little better; watched Lydia expand her Nobleman magazine empire; and also learned a bit more about her family's history as media moguls in her native Canada.\n        Last month, Meghan King Edmonds revealed her departure from the show.

Smartest people of them all are the ‘DEPLORABLES,'” he wrote on Twitter on Tuesday night, two days after Sunday’s Primetime Emmy Awards telecast. The President is in New York, staying at Trump Tower, during the United Nations General Assembly.\n        The Emmys, broadcast by CBS, were about on par with last year’s ceremony in terms of total viewers. Sunday’s awards ceremony averaged 11.4 million viewers, compared to 2016’s 11.3 million, its lowest ever. The telecast also averaged a 2.5 rating in adults 18-49, dropping below last year’s low point of a 2.8.\n    \n        Host Stephen Colbert spent part of his monologue skewering Trump’s own fixation with the Emmys, including his past tweets that disparaged the awards handed out by the Television Academy after he failed to win any Emmy trophies for “The Apprentice.” In a tweet from 2013, Trump cited political bias for his lack of Emmy wins.\n        Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, criticized the “politicized” show for the “sameness” of the attacks on Trump.\n    \n        “It looks like Americans are tuning out,” she said on “Fox & Friends.”\n    \n        Then she addressed stars who appeared on the stage. “They want you to stick to your knitting.

The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story actor, 30, announced their engagement news on Instagram and Twitter Friday evening. “Mia and I have had seven and a half years of fun, wacky, wonderful, CRAZY adventures together,” Criss wrote along with a photo of the happy couple. “And I’m happy to announce that we’re kicking those adventures up a notch. We’re goin for it. To boldly go where neither of us have gone before. Engage,” the former Glee star added.\nThough the date of the proposal is unknown, Criss and Swier, 32, last attended the Los Angeles premiere of the FX series in Hollywood together on Jan. 8 when the writer and producer was spotted without an engagement ring on that finger. “Oh yeah, we’ve been together a long time,” Criss said in a 2013 interview when asked about Swier. “I didn’t know I was going to be on TV when we started dating.”\nSwier attended New York University’s Steinhardt School of Media Studies and Television Production, and has worked for networks such as Fox and Showtime. It certainly has been a great start to 2018 for the former Glee actor, with his new show,Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story, premiering Wednesday to strong ratings. Criss stars in the FX show as Andrew Cunanan, the man who murdered famed fashion designer, Gianni Versace.",

With Bruno Mars sweeping the major categories, Fonsi and Yankee weren’t able to make that historic stride forward, but the Puerto Rican artists remained positive.\n“We’re not leaving empty-handed tonight,” wrote Fonsi on Instagram following the award show. “To be able to break the language barrier and unite the world with a song is the best prize anyone can win. Let’s continue sharing our culture and our Latin music with the entire world. Thanks for supporting us, this is just the beginning.”\nYankee shared the same image, writing, “Thanks to all #latinos for coming together to see us shine at the #grammys.”For Fonsi, the Grammy nod — and potential win — was all about celebrating his Latin heritage and pride. Before the ceremony, he spoke to ET about what the evening meant to him. “This is really big,” he said. “Not only for me, but for Latin music in general, to be able to sing a song in Spanish for the big show. I’m really proud to be here. Being from Puerto Rico, growing up here in the United States, I’ve always been so proud of my roots and my language, and all these artists who are performing, they’ve all influenced me. So to be able to celebrate a little bit of who I am and where I’m from, and to share with the world, and break that language barrier — especially after everything that [Puerto Rico has] been going through.”\nAlthough the two artists kept their post-Grammy messages positive, some celebs and fans felt the duo were robbed, including Perez Hilton and Frankie Grande, the brother of pop star Ariana Grande.\nThey didn’t walk away with a trophy, but Fonsi and Yankee gave a rousing performance of “Despacito” that brought the crowd, including Chrissy Teigen and John Legend, to their feet and won a standing ovation from the audience.",

This dispute is reportedly \"why the divorce is not final\" and has \"dragged on for months.\"\n\n\"The latest issue is that Angelina wants to film in Europe for months and take all six kids with her for the duration of the shoot,\" the insider tells E! News. \"Brad is opposed to that and is blocking it from happening. Brad will be filming in L.A. for the summer and wants to see the kids on his regular custody schedule.\"\n\nThe source tells E! News Jolie is \"furious\" with the situation. However, it looks like Pitt isn't pleased with it, either.\n\n\"He's not OK with his kids being away for months,\" the insider continues. \"He feels that Los Angeles is their home base and this is where it is best for them to be.\" \n\nHowever, this doesn't mean that Jolie can't travel with her kids at all. The actress already took Shiloh and Zahara to Jordan in January to visit a refugee camp. She also brought all of her children to Paris that same month. The insider tells E! News Jolie recently travelled to England, as well.\n\n\"Angelina has been in London and is free to travel for shorter periods of time,\" the source says. \"Brad isn't opposed to that. But she can't leave with the kids for several months.\"\nWhen Jolie filed for divorce in September 2016, she asked for sole physical custody of the children. Pitt responded by filing for joint physical custody in November.\n\nBy December, the exes had reached a temporary agreement. The agreement determined that the children would stay in Jolie's care and that Pitt would have \"therapeutic\" visitation.\n\nThe temporary agreement came shortly after the Federal Bureau of Investigation closed its investigation into Pitt regarding an alleged incident with a child on a private plane. No charges were filed. It also came after the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services cleared Pitt of child abuse allegations.\n\nPitt opened up about the situation in an interview with GQ Style published in May 2017.\n\n\"I was really on my back and chained to a system when Child Services was called,\" he told the magazine. \"And you know, after that, we've been able to work together to sort this out. We're both doing our best. I heard one lawyer say, ‘No one wins in court—it's just a matter of who gets hurt worse.' And it seems to be true, you spend a year just focused on building a case to prove your point and why you're right and why they're wrong, and it's just an investment in vitriolic hatred. I just refuse. And fortunately my partner in this agrees. It's just very, very jarring for the kids, to suddenly have their family ripped apart.\"",

And that was the end and I’ve gone on with my life. For it to come back now, it’s a terrible thing to accuse a person of. I’m a man with a family and my own children.”\n\nThe story was resurfaced after allegations were made against Harvey Weinstein and other key figures in Hollywood of sexually predatory behavior. It led to many actors talking about their regret over working with Allen, including Greta Gerwig, Colin Firth and Ellen Page.\n\n“Everyone wants justice to be done,” Allen said. “If there is something like the #MeToo movement now, you root for them, you want them to bring to justice these terrible harassers, these people who do all these terrible things. And I think that’s a good thing.”\n\nBut the 82-year-old is frustrated that his name has been used alongside the men accused of misconduct. He said that the people who have been accused by multiple women shouldn’t be equated with him, as he was “only accused by one woman in a child custody case” and believes he should be heralded as an important ally.\n\n“As I say, I’m a big advocate of the #MeToo movement,” he said. “I feel when they find people who harass innocent women and men, it’s a good thing that they’re exposing them. But you know I, I should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement. Because I have worked in movies for 50 years. I’ve worked with hundreds of actresses and not a single one – big ones, famous ones, ones starting out – have ever, ever suggested any kind of impropriety at all. I’ve always had a wonderful record with them.”\n\nIn a statement released last year, Allen referred to Weinstein as a “sad, sick man”.\n\nLast month saw Allen’s son Moses Farrow defend him in a blogpost, calling his sister’s story a “discredited allegation” and accusing his mother, Mia Farrow, of “brainwashing” and abusive behavior. In response, Dylan Farrow called his words “beyond hurtful”.\n\nWhen he made similar accusations in a book published in September 2017, Mia Farrow said in a statement: “Moses has cut off his entire family including his ex-wife, who was pregnant when he left. It’s heartbreaking and bewildering that he would make this up, perhaps to please Woody. We all miss and love him very much.”\n\nAllen’s next film, A Rainy Day in New York, faces an uncertain future after stars Timothée Chalamet, Selena Gomez and Rebecca Hall donated their salaries to various charities. The romantic comedy is yet to receive a release date.",

Not only is it always glowing and radiant, but her pores are virtually non-existent, she has an even skin tone and she doesn’t seem to have had a pimple in years.\n    \nSo, it is understandable that when the model and founder of skin care brand KORA Organics shared her top skin care tips with Teen Vogue, including the product she uses to clear her blemishes overnight, we were all ears.\n\nAccording to the model, facial oils are her go-to when confronted with a surprise pimple. “If I’m having a breakout, I like to balance the pH of my skin with my Noni Glow Oil. I find that really helps, even with treating it overnight. I put it on after cleansing, misting, exfoliating and moisturising,” she said.\n\nWhile we’re not debating the effectiveness the oil has on Miranda’s skin, we wanted to check in with a skin care expert to find out if facial oils can work as an effective pimple treatment for the rest of us. And if the advice from Bryan Barron Director of Research and Content at Paula’s Choice, is anything to go by, it isn’t good news.\n\nIn fact, Barron says, “While some people report success using oils to banish breakouts, mounds of research has shown that gently removing excess oil and controlling acne-causing bacteria with benzoyl peroxide, and using a leave-on exfoliant with salicylic acid is a proven, reliable approach for acne at any age.”\n\nUltimately, while facial oils are a vital addition in any skin care routine as they work wonders to nourish, plump and hydrate the skin, using them as a pimple treatment may not deliver the same results as the proven acne treatment duo of benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid.",

       "post_text": "Gal Gadot is really the Hollywood find of 2017. She did appear in a few films before, including a brief appearance in Batman v Superman, but it was in 2017 that she shone. Gal has in a minuscule amount of time risen to become one of the top most actors in Hollywood. Her performance in this summer’s DC blockbuster Wonder Woman helped DC’s cinematic universe get on track and she was adored even in Justice League, which was a failure for Warner Bros and DC. She did only two films this year, but since those films came from a big studio like Warner Bros and were superhero movies that usually earn big bucks, they helped her to become the highest paid actress of 2017, according to Forbes. Oh, and she was pregnant while filming many of her stunts in Justice League. Isn’t she really the Wonder Woman?\n    \nMeanwhile, the gorgeous Israeli actor took to social media to reminisce the last year and posted a collage to give her fans glimpses of top moments of the year for her. The first photo is of The Hollywood Reporter’s cover with a photo of she and Wonder Woman’s director Patty Jenkins. The collage continues with her photo with the rest of the Justice League cast, Wonder Woman cast, a photo of her with the poster of Wonder Woman, a pregnant Gal Gadot posing with her husband, Gal posing in a Justice League, she hugging a fan, Wonder Woman cast posing with little Wonder Women, and finally Gal Gadot at Saturday Night Live.\n\nShe captioned the photo, “Thank you 2017 you’ve been incredible. 2018 I’m ready for you.. 😏 wishing you all – happiness, health and luck!! Happy New Year!!!”\nIt need not be said that these are the high points for many of her fans, not just her. She has been an inspiration for little girls who needed a stirring female superhero figure in a world dominated by masculine superheroes. Indeed, the immense success of her film showed that there is a huge audience for a well-made female-led superhero movie. Its success also prompted Warner Bros to lighten the tone of Justice League, and that was one of the things about it that were appreciated.",

Although he wasn't arrested and no charges were filed, officers at Los Angeles International Airport detected a small amount of cocaine on the actor's belongings after a routine inspection by a customs canine. Heaton, who plays Jonathan Byers on Stranger Things, was returned to London and missed out on the show's L.A. premiere event for the second season.\n        \n        The actor now says the incident is “all sorted,” and he reveals to Flaunt magazine that the public scrutiny he received over the experience was “fucking awful,” as noted by the NME. Hearton admits that his newfound fame from Stranger Things served as an impediment in relation to the drug debacle:\n        \n        “It was hard,” he says. “Everything happened so fast, and I hadn't come to terms with the fact that I was famous.

Gomez and Bieber arrived at church in Bieber's Jeep. They entered the building separately, but the same woman in the photo alongside them makes it clear they walked in the door only seconds apart.\n\nJustin arriving.\n\nSelena arriving.\n\nChurch-goers also spotted the two\u2014and one filmed Gomez at the front of the church. The back of Bieber's head appears to be visible in the video because of his current Shaggy-esque blond hairstyle.\n\nThey were not photographed, filmed or said to be showing PDA at service like they have during previous weeks. Bieber's rumored ex-fling Kourtney Kardashian was also photographed arriving at the same service.\n\nWednesday night public date nights are kind of Jelena's thing. Since they reconciled in the fall, Bieber and Gomez have been regularly seen by Los Angeles church-goers at Wednesday night service (sometimes kissing) and have been often photographed by paparazzi at the ice rink that same evening. Bieber plays hockey almost weekly and devoted girlfriend Gomez occasionally (boredly) watches.\n\nGomez just returned to Los Angeles yesterday morning. She was photographed getting off the plane in sweats, out hiking later with her assistant Theresa Mingus, and then ultimately in a jean jacket at church with the Biebs. Her full outfit from service is likely the one from that afternoon, photographed more clearly below:\n\nGomez out in Los Angeles before her hike yesterday afternoon.\n\nThe latest report about Bieber and Gomez's relationship came out over the weekend after news broke that Gomez spent two weeks in a treatment program in New York City for anxiety and depression. Bieber was really supportive, a source close to Bieber told People. \u201cTheir relationship is very special. They have both changed, their lives are so different and it really seems things could work out great this time. Justin realized that he needed to change, reached out for help and is doing very well. The same [goes] for Selena \u2014 the second she doesn\u2019t feel well, she seeks help. They have both hugely matured. Justin is very supportive of Selena feeling her best.\u201d",

The 'Insecure' creator told Stephen Colbert that she got flustered when she met the bad gyal at the Met Gala.\n\nByVictoria L. Johnson\nAug 10, 2018\nCOMMENT\n\nIssa Rae won a Peabody Award for her Emmy\u2013nominated series Insecure. But even she gets a little tongue-tied in front of Rihanna. On The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Rae explained she ran into Riri at the Met Gala. Although the two have already met, it didn't stop Rae from getting a bit flustered.\n\n\"I just saw her sitting at the table and I had had a few drinks,\" explained Rae around the 1:50 mark above. \"So I was like 'Rihanna's over there, let me go say hi, she knows me, we homegirls.' And I went up to her and I was like, you know, tapped her. And she was so friendly and nice, I wasn't expecting that, and she was like 'Hey girl, good to see you!' And I was like 'Uh...oh...we're, uh...' and just excused myself and walked away. So any chance that we had to be best friends, I ruined it with my drunken nervousness, starstruck-ness.\"\n\nThis likely won't be the last time the two cross paths though since Rae is supposed to be writing a Twitter-conceived heist film starring Lupita Nyong'o and Rihanna. In the meantime, the two definitely have at least one thing in common\u2014they've both been pursued by Drake. While RiRi made it clear she's not interested in the Toronto rapper, Rae once again stated she did not turn him down at the Golden Globes.\n\n\"I was heading to the HBO party, as I should, and he [Drake] was leaving the HBO party. And so we crossed paths and he said the most magical words ever. He was like 'I've been looking for you all night.' And I was like 'You talking about me?' And he was like 'I'm about to go to this Netflix party, do you want to go?' And I was like 'Oh I have to go stop in the HBO party' because they're the network that puts my show on, I couldn't just ditch the party and go to Netflix party even though that's what I really wanted to do. So I was like 'I'll catch you at that party.' That was it. Then I went to the party and all of a sudden blogs were reporting that I turned him down which would never happen.\"\n\nLuckily, that didn't stop Rae from turning up in Drake's \"Nice for What\" video alongside a ton of other famous women, which she called it a \"dream come true.\"\n\nAs for her critically-acclaimed HBO series Insecure, Rae told Colbert her mom stopped watching after a few racy scenes in season 2. Season 3 is slated to begin this Sunday at 10:30 p.m. with undoubtedly more scenes for Rae's mom to frown at.",

This is more or less what I discover while grilling the newly minted redhead for all the deets surrounding her forever-flawless face, which always seems to be gracing either the stage or screen.\n\nTo get that glow, the down-to-earth Hough relies heavily upon a teen-beloved skincare line (more on that below), drugstore makeup, and something my mom always nagged me about when I was younger: hydration. \"Most people aren\u2019t well hydrated, and drinking regular water isn\u2019t enough,\" she tells me from a Propel event in Los Angeles. \"You really have to replenish the electrolytes you are losing\u2014that's my not-so-secret secret.\"\n\nThis simple trick appears to be paying off in spades in terms of creating a natural glow, as Hough's daily makeup routine is best described as minimal. \"I just wear a little bit of concealer, some gel on my eyebrows, and I do a quick little contour on my cheeks,\" she tells me as we talk more things makeup at a separate Fitbit event. \"[For meetings], I amp it up a bit more by adding a bronze-y eyeshadow, a smudged eyeliner on the top so it\u2019s not too perfect, and a coral-pink lip.\" Keep scrolling for the must-have beauty products that *make* her look.\n\nPhoto: La Mer\nLa Mer Lip Balm, $60\n\"I love a good lip balm that I can put on my cheeks every day because it gives me a dewy, fresh-faced feel,\" she says. \"With La Mer's yummy lip balm, I\u2019ll do my lips, and then whatever is left on my finger, I\u2019ll slather it on the high cheekbone area.\"\n\nPhoto: L'Oreal Paris\nL\u2019Oreal Voluminous Original Mascara, $6\n\"I\u2019ve been using this mascara since I was 15 years old,\" Hough says. \"I usually use the black-brown shade.\"\n\nPure Argan Oil, $13\n\"I have good hair that listens, so sometimes when it\u2019s dry I mix Unite's 7Seconds, argan oil, and a beach-day spray in my palm and put it through my hair,\" she tells me. \"It creates a fun little texture.\"\n\nPhoto: NARS\nNARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil, $19\n\"For my lips, I love the NARS pencil chubs, so I usually use those,\" she tells me. \"I\u2019m sort of a \u2018less is more\u2019 person and I want to see my lip coming through, although I really do love red lipstick, too.\"\n\nPhoto: Proactive\nProactiv Skin Purifying Mask, $38\n\"I definitely use Proactiv\u2014my favorite product is their refining mask,\" she tells me. \"Also, Proactiv MD is the new luxury, medical version which contains Adapalene, an ingredient you used to not be able to get but now can.\"\n\nCan\u2019t get enough of Ms. Hough? Check out her morning routine, steal her smoothie recipe or get inspired by how she overcame this major health crisis.\nTags: Makeup Tips, Skin-Care Tips",

The internet is reeling over the color of a sneaker after Twitter user @TFILDOLANS posted a photo of the shoe that appear gray with teal accents to some people, while others see pink with white accents.

She must report to prison in 45 days.\n\n'Dance Moms' Star Abby Lee Miller Indicted for Fraud\n\nMiller was indicted on fraud charges in 2015 for allegedly hiding from a bankruptcy court $775,000 in income she earned after filing a petition to reorganize her Pittsburgh dance studio in 2010.\n\nLast June, she pleaded guilty to purposely hiding that income. She also pleaded guilty to an unrelated charge of sneaking $120,000 in foreign currency into the United States from Australia, which, according to The Associated Press, she agreed to forfeit.\n\nProsecutors wanted Miller to spend 2.5 years in prison, while her attorneys were hoping for probation because all of her creditors were made whole after the fraud was discovered.\n\nMiller was known for her strong personality and fiery interactions with her students and their parents before quitting the Lifetime reality show in March. She later said she stepped away from the show because it had taken a toll on her mental health after years of \"being manipulated, disrespected, and used day in and day out by men.\"\n\nLifetime, which declined to comment on Miller's departure, has kept the show going with guest choreographers, including former \"Dancing With the Stars\" pro Cheryl Burke.",

        "post_text": "Tavis Smiley's show dropped by PBS amid 'troubling allegations' of misconduct\nMaria Puente\nUSA TODAY\n\nPBS's late-night talk show Tavis Smiley was suspended Wednesday after \"multiple, credible allegations\" of misconduct emerged about the popular host/producer. Smiley greeted the news with shock and outrage.\n\nPBS sent a statement to USA TODAY late Wednesday declaring that the public broadcaster had \"indefinitely suspended\" distribution of Tavis Smiley, produced by Smiley's independent production company, TS Media.\n\n\"PBS engaged an outside law firm to conduct an investigation immediately after learning of troubling allegations regarding Mr. Smiley,\" the statement read. \"This investigation included interviews with witnesses as well as with Mr. Smiley. The inquiry uncovered multiple, credible allegations of conduct that is inconsistent with the values and standards of PBS, and the totality of this information led to today\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\nThe consequences for Smiley mounted almost immediately. Late Thursday, Walmart, which had been a sponsor of Smiley's talk show and an upcoming touring theatrical show, announced it cut ties with him. The theatrical show, Death of a King: A Live Theatrical Experience, is based on Smiley's 2014 book of the same title and was to start Jan. 15, King's birthday.\n\n\"We take these issues very seriously and are troubled by the recent allegations,\" the retail giant said in a statement according to the Associated Press. \"As a result, we are suspending our relationship with Mr. Smiley, pending the outcome of the PBS investigation.\"\n\nAnd Hay House, which distributes the Smiley Books imprint, said all Smiley projects were \"on hold\" pending an internal review. Smiley had planned in September to release Leading by Listening: Connecting through Conversation to Transform Your Relationships and Your Business.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Smiley said he was \"as shocked as anyone else by PBS\u2019 announcement.\"\n\n\"I have the utmost respect for women and celebrate the courage of those who have come forth to tell their truth. To be clear, I have never groped, coerced, or exposed myself inappropriately to any workplace colleague in my entire broadcast career, covering 6 networks over 30 years. Never. Ever. Never.\"\n\nSmiley said PBS \"overreacted and conducted a biased and sloppy investigation, which led to a rush to judgment...trampling on a reputation that I have spent an entire lifetime trying to establish. This has gone too far. And, I, for one, intend to fight back.\"\n\nSmiley is an occasional contributor to USA TODAY's opinion section. On Thursday, PBS released a statement responding to Smiley's outrage, saying it stands by the \"integrity\" of the investigation of Smiley. PBS declined to discuss the nature of the allegations but Smiley's response suggested they involved alleged sexual misconduct.\n\nAfter the PBS suspension, Variety reported, quoting unnamed sources, that the investigation found credible allegations that Smiley had engaged in sexual relationships with multiple subordinates, and that some believed their jobs depended on a sexual relationship with Smiley. Also, Smiley was accused of creating a verbally abusive and threatening environment and employees feared retaliation.\n\nSmiley hosted Tavis Smiley, a half-hour interview program that premiered in 2004 and airs weeknights on PBS stations.\n\nAs the former host of BET Tonight With Tavis Smiley on Black Entertainment Television, Smiley became known as \"black America's favorite talk show host,\" according to National Public Radio, and he has been one of the few black hosts on PBS.\n\nSmiley is the second late-night host on PBS to lose his spot on public television, following the derailing of Charlie Rose's career on PBS and CBS following allegations of sexual misconduct. \"PBS has terminated its relationship with Charlie Rose and canceled distribution of his programs,\" PBS said in a statement at the time. \"PBS expects all the producers we work with to provide a workplace where people feel safe and are treated with dignity and respect.\"\n\nBoth Smiley and Rose have been caught up in a national deluge of sexual harassment and assault allegations that have felled powerful men in entertainment, media, politics, business and fashion in the last two months.\n\nLast year, Smiley and co-author David Ritz published Before You Judge Me: The Triumph and Tragedy of Michael Jackson\u2019s Last Days just days before the seventh anniversary of the superstar\u2019s death. The non-fiction book takes a novelistic approach, speculating on how Jackson feels, what he's thinking, and most pointedly, how he cannot sleep in the 16 weeks leading up to his death.\n\nSmiley has a deal with Warner Bros. Television to develop the book, along with J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot, into an \u201cevent television series.\u201d",

He has more than 25 years\u2019 experience at PEOPLE covering the royals, human interest and celebrity.\nPeople Editorial Guidelines\nPublished on October 19, 2017 10:49AM EDT\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2018s road to engagement just hit another milestone.\nThe couple visited Buckingham Palace for a private tea with Harry\u2019s grandmother Queen Elizabeth, according to a new report in the Daily Mail by authoritative royals columnist Richard Kay.\nThe couple, who have been dating for at least 15 months, arrived in a Ford Galaxy station wagon with blacked-out windows for the discreet appointment last Thursday. They were then \u201cwhisked up to the Queen\u2019s private sitting room\u201d for the hour-long meeting, Kay reports. (We assume her no-fail, go-to jeanswere not her choice of attire for this particular occasion!)\nSplash News Online\nLater that evening, Harry was in top form as he accepted a posthumous award honoring the HIV/AIDS activism of his mother, Princess Diana, at the Attitude magazine awards.\nSpokespeople at Kensington Palace and Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the report.\nThere is critical significance in Markle\u2019s meeting with the Queen. Harry is fifth in the line of succession (he\u2019ll be pushed to sixth after William and Kate welcome their third baby this spring), meaning he has to have the monarch\u2019s permission to wed.\nThere had been rumors that the Suits star and the Queen may have met earlier \u2014 during a visit to Balmoral Castle in Scotland.\nLast month, Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36, made their public debut as a couple at the Invictus Games in Toronto, where they held hands at a wheelchair tennis event and spent time with her mom, Doria. Before the games, Markle had spoken in a way that no other royal girlfriend or boyfriend had done so before, saying they were \u201ctwo people who are really happy and in love.\u201d\nKarwai Tang/WireImage\nAnd if there is any doubt that Harry would need to worry about securing his grandmother\u2019s approval, one inside source tells PEOPLE he would be in the clear. \u201cIf Harry asks for something, she would say yes as she adores him,\u201d the source says.\nIf they are to wed, there are suggestions it would take place at St. George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle.\nLast week was a busy one for the royals: The Queen, 91, returned from her annual Scottish summer getaway, and Harry helped host a party for mental health professionals in the palace on Tuesday. This week has been active as well, with Harry joining his grandmother on Tuesday for a private reception of the Queen\u2019s Commonwealth Trust, a fledgling charity. Harry \u2013 who features on the organization\u2019s new website \u2014 has taken a prominent role in several projects for the Commonwealth, especially based around young people and the environment.",

At the time, he and Silverman were living together in the U.S., but the votes signaled the end of their four-year relationship. \u201cWe both had very similar drives, and yet to act on those drives pulled us in different directions\u2014because she is American and I\u2019m Welsh.\n\n\u201cAfter the Brexit vote, and the election where Trump became president, we both felt in different ways we wanted to get more involved. That led to her doing her show I Love You, America, and it led to me wanting to address the issues that I thought led some people to vote the way they did about Brexit, in the area I come from and others like it.\n\n\u201cI felt a responsibility to do something, but it did mean coming back here\u2014which was difficult for us, because we were very important to each other. But we both acknowledge that each of us had to do what we needed to do.\u201d\n\nSheen has since been working with a range of grassroots groups in his hometown in Wales aiming to combat inequality, which includes supporting credit unions and paying for research into ways of funding local journalism.\n\nAs the Telegraph says, Sheen \u201csounds a little wistful\u201d about politics coming before love.",

        "post_text": "In the new HBO documentary series Being Serena, tennis champion and Vogue cover star Serena Williams shares it all: her surprise pregnancy, dangerous delivery, courageous recovery, and triumphant return to tennis. The series offers an inside look at one of the world\u2019s greatest athletes, elucidating the immense power she possesses to fight for what she wants\u2014at times, her life. The cameras follow Williams\u2019s every move: inside the delivery room, with baby Olympia, and in the middle of planning her fairy-tale wedding, as well as her matches back on the tennis court. It\u2019s a tell-all video memoir that will undoubtedly enthrall viewers. Serena Williams is truly one of a kind.\n\nAt the premiere of Being Serena in New York City\u2019s Time Warner Center, Williams\u2019s family and friends gathered to celebrate her success. On the red carpet, she sparkled in a light pink dress with shimmering gold sleeves designed by her eponymous label. Sister Venus Williams also wore a black Serena Williams design, including a bomber jacket with shiny silver sleeves. The Williams sisters weren\u2019t the only big sister-little sister duo on the red carpet: Gigi Hadid, in a Derek Lam camel-color suit, matched with Bella Hadid in a black Tom Ford suit. Other attendees included Serena\u2019s husband and tech entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian, Vera Wang, Anna Wintour, and Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s Bob Sauerberg.\n\nA consistent theme of both the series and sentiment among Serena\u2019s friends and family is her many layers. She\u2019s a tennis master, entrepreneur, fashion designer, and philanthropist. Her most recent and proudest accolade agreed upon by all, including Serena herself, was the birth of her daughter, Olympia. On the red carpet, Serena told Vogue: \u201cThe one thing I\u2019m most proud of is becoming a mom. That is everything, hands down.\u201d On what she has not yet accomplished but would love to, Serena said, \u201cBecoming a multi-mom. I have some records I want to break, but having more kids is my goal.\u201d Olympia is already proving to be a stylish baby thanks to Serena\u2019s good taste. When dressing her, often in mommy-and-me matching style, Williams said, \u201cI just think about things that are comfortable and easy to change a diaper. I get most of her clothes on Amazon. They have great, fun clothes. I want her to be very humble, and I want to start that at an early age.\u201d Ohanian added, \u201cI am so proud and in awe of my wife!\u201d\n\nVenus agreed with Serena on her sister\u2019s greatest accomplishment: \u201cShe\u2019s a tennis champion and an unbelievable mom. She does everything for the baby. Balancing her career is not easy, especially when you\u2019re a world tennis champion. I\u2019m most proud of her for that.\u201d Designer Vera Wang shared similar sentiment, telling Vogue: \u201cUnderneath that incredible champion is a very human woman. When she gets off the court, she has a desire for a very different kind of life. People will understand the struggle of what it is to be a champion at that level. It\u2019s a wonderful dichotomy\u2014people see the glamour, they see the wins, they see the trophies. But they don\u2019t know what that struggle is day in and day out. There are two sides: There\u2019s the woman side and there\u2019s the champion side, and they\u2019re really one in the same.\u201d\n\nFollowing the red carpet, guests gathered into the movie theater to watch the first two episodes of the Being Serena series. Baby Olympia sat on Serena\u2019s lap in the theater, while a few rows away the Hadid sisters sat next to Wang and Wintour. After the screening, guests dined at Porter House in Columbus Circle, where the Williams clan enjoyed steak and MoonPies, a personal favorite of Serena\u2019s.",

This was not an easy decision for either of us because we do love each other very much but sometimes God has other plans,\" the pair tells PEOPLE in an exclusive statement. \"This is the route we have decided to take, and all we request is that you respect our privacy in this delicate matter. Divorce is never easy for anyone, especially not such a public one.\"\n\nThe pair add that they \"remain best of friends and will always be there for each other even if we are not married. We plan to continue to grow our relationship, just without a piece of paper binding us together. We appreciate all the love and support you have all shown us during our marriage and hope you continue to support us during this time.\"\n\nAfter their split was announced, Vilchez shared the couple's joint statement to Instagram \u2014 where she added \"@tomyachts Still love you though!\" \u2014 and also opened up about their decision to call it quits.\n\n\"Someone can be madly in love with you and still not be ready. They can love you in a way you have never been loved and still not join you on the bridge. And whatever their reasons you must leave. Because you never ever have to inspire anyone to meet you on the bridge.\n\n\"You never ever have to convince someone to do the work to be ready.

On paper, they are truly the perfect match but life got in the way.\"\n\nThough the duo certainly had many sweet moments as newlyweds, they also butted heads over their future together, with Vilchez often feeling insecure about her husband's commitment to their marriage.\n\nThe current season of Married at First Sight airs Thursdays (9 p.m. ET) on Lifetime.",

The remaining money came in during the telecast.\n\n\"With the disasters and tragedies befalling us almost weekly, and the swirling negativity dividing our country, it was gratifying to see people of all ages, races and backgrounds come together to support and help those in need,\" Lopez said in a statement. \"Alex and I were amazed by the amount of love, unity and donations that were received.\"\n\n\"It's been an incredibly difficult time for the people in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean,\" Rodriguez added. \"These people were the first to answer our call to help with this cause.

Emily Maynard and Jef Holm, the edgy, Mormon entrepreneur, are engaged to be married. In a tearful season finale Sunday night, after meeting daughter Ricki for the first time, Jef got down on one knee and proposed to Emily, to which she hastily accepted. However, instead of rejecting the proposal of Arie Luyendyk Jr., the racecar driver, she respectfully let him go the day before, sparing him the embarrassment that many before have experienced on the show.\n\nInterestingly, it was later revealed that after the show ended Arie traveled to Charlotte, North Carolina, the hometown of Emily, because he didn\u2019t feel their emotional breakup had enough closure. Although he didn\u2019t see Emily, they talked on the phone, and he dropped off the diary he kept with him throughout the journey on her doorstep, urging her to read through it. However, Emily has not yet read the diary, and she revealed as much last night on the live portion of the show when she took out the diary which was still inside a sealed envelope. \n\nWill Jef and Emily last? Only time will tell. But, I can tell you that they definitely have a better shot at working out than she would have had with Arie, whose fast-paced racecar driver lifestyle would be difficult to juggle with a family. Jef, on the other hand, is the much safer bet: not only does his job seem very flexible, but also he expressed his feelings to Emily whereas Arie demonstrated them physically and sexually. If she had chosen Arie, their relationship would most likely have suffered. \n\nWith another season of The Bachelorette in the record books, who will be the next man chosen to be on The Bachelor? My two bets would be Arie and Sean Lowe, the insurance agent who made it all the way to the final three in Curacao only to be let go. Rumors say it will be Sean, but don\u2019t count Arie out. Both would make for interesting seasons.",

Not only has her wedding prep put a strain on her friendship with Margaret Josephs, but it has also put a microscope on some of the challenges in her relationship with her groom, Marty Caffrey.\n\nSpecifically, Danielle's revelation in Wednesday night's episode of RHONJ that she doesn't get along with Marty's three children left the rest of the Garden State crew speechless. \"I command respect,\" Danielle shared during the episode. \"If you're not going to respect me, stay out of my space.\" Marty then said that no one is responsible for how this situation turned out, and he concluded the conversation by expressing how painful it has been to see his kids and his future wife at odds. \"I chose you at the detriment of them and my relationship with them,\" he said to Danielle on RHONJ. \"And therefore, we have to move on. Life is short. That's all I have to say.\"\n\nDanielle addressed her comments about Marty's children in an Instagram post published in advance of the episode airing on Wednesday, December 19. \"Here\u2019s my message. I love all children of all ages! Keep in mind [that] his kids are well into their 30s. They are adults living on their own,\" Danielle wrote in an Instagram post that featured a photo of herself with Margaret, Melissa Gorga, and Teresa Giudice while they were in Bimini in the Bahamas for her wedding. \"They should\u2019ve respected their father and not made him choose between us! I enforced and supported his relationship [with] them. He chose not to speak to them and I won\u2019t shoulder his decision or theirs!\"\n\nThe other members of the RHONJ squad offer up their take on this tense dinner moment in The Real Housewives of New Jersey Season 9 After Show, which you can check out, above.\n\nDanielle and Marty tied the knot on May 5, and two months later, reports began to surface of trouble in the RHONJ couple's marriage. It was then reported that the couple had filed temporary restraining orders against one another following an incident at their home in August, which were eventually dropped.\n\nMarty filed for divorce from Danielle in August. Danielle spoke out about her split on The Wendy Williams Show in October. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how I saw certain things happening, but you just believe, especially with the perception around us, getting engaged would make it better \u2026 getting married would make it better,\" she shared. \"It doesn\u2019t get better, ladies. If it\u2019s falling apart, it\u2019s broken. You can't fix that.\u201d\n\nThe couple continued to live together following their breakup. It was later reported that Marty had put their New Jersey home on the market, which Danielle only found out about after the fact online.\n\nEarlier this month, Danielle was reportedly spotted getting cozy with R&B singer Al B. Sure in New York City.\n\nLook back on Danielle and Marty's destination wedding trip, below.",

But even if winning a Golden Globe isn\u2019t considered as much of an accomplishment as winning an Oscar, the Globes can often indicate which way the Hollywood winds are blowing. Here\u2019s everything you need to know to enjoy the red carpet. Who\u2019s the host?\n\nSeth Meyers, who you may know from his NBC late-night show, the aptly named Late Night with Seth Meyers. Or maybe you somehow caught his appearance in the 2008 movie Journey to the Center of the Earth \u2014 which, last I checked, was most notable for killing off the last vestiges of Brendan Fraser\u2019s cinematic career.\n\nIt\u2019s Meyers\u2019 first time hosting, but he\u2019ll be following in the talk-show-host footsteps of Jimmy Fallon, who hosted the Golden Globes last year. So at least the bar has been set for Meyers\u2019 brand of humor. NBC is marketing the show under the tagline \u201cHollywood, we have a lot to talk about,\u201d so expect lots of fun and not-at-all uncomfortable and awkward humor about the recent turmoil in Hollywood over sexual harassment and abuse. Meyers has commented in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that he took the gig in the first place after conversations with his wife and women on the writing staff, viewing it as \u201can opportunity to be able to say some things that you wouldn\u2019t be able to say in previous years.\u201d\n\nWho\u2019s up for the big awards?\n\nOn the film side of things, The Shape of Water, (seven nominations), The Post (six nominations) and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (also six) lead the pack. Lady Bird (four nominations) is also in the mix for several big awards, although not for Best Director, since that category once again completely overlooked all female directors. The awards aimed at TV shows are more widely distributed. HBO\u2019s Big Little Lies leads with six nominations, but it\u2019s up against a slate of other prominent prestige shows, including The Handmaid's Tale, This Is Us, Master of None, Stranger Things, and The Crown. The full list of nominations is available here.\n\nWhen does this awards shindig start?\n\nThe 75th Golden Globe Awards will start at 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET on Sunday night, January 7th. The ceremony will take place at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. The show will be broadcast live on NBC, as it has been since 1993. And if you just can\u2019t get enough of the glamour, you can tune in an hour earlier for the red carpet arrivals, which will be streamed exclusively on Facebook.\n\nOkay, I\u2019m in. How do I watch?\n\nDo you have NBC? Like through an over-the-air antenna, cable, or satellite television? Because this would really be a lot simpler if you did. You can simply just head over to your local NBC affiliate (Channel 4 in both NYC and the LA / Hollywood area), and you\u2019ll be all set. Sound good?\n\nNo. How do I watch on the internet?\n\nGood news! Unlike last year, where NBC didn\u2019t stream the Golden Globes at all, apparently due to the fact that the company\u2019s contract with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association doesn\u2019t include streaming rights, this year you\u2019ll be able to watch the Golden Globes online! According to a report from The Hollywood Reporter, NBC and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association have reached a deal to allow for online streaming of the awards show this year.\n\nSo if you have a cable or satellite provider with NBC (or a login from someone who does), you\u2019ll be able to watch online live through NBC\u2019s app (iOS / Android) or website.\n\nIs that it?\n\nNo cable at all? No problem. Over-the-top subscription services like DirecTV Now, Playstation Vue, Sling TV, YouTube TV, and Hulu\u2019s live TV service all offer NBC, at least in some areas, and if you can get NBC on one of those services where you live, you\u2019ll be able to watch the Golden Globes live there. (You\u2019ll have to check local listings for specific over-the-top services, and different services may or may not have NBC, based on where you live.) And even if you\u2019re not a subscriber, fortunately, most of these services offer free seven-day trials, so you won\u2019t be committing to a long-term subscription if you want to give it a shot \u2014 just remember to cancel your subscription afterward so you don\u2019t get charged.\n\nPlus, there\u2019s always Twitter if you\u2019d like to follow along with reactions and memes in real time \u2014 and The Verge will be reporting live on the night, with a running list of winners, reactions, and other news.\n\nUpdate January 5th, 12:30pm: Based on a report from The Hollywood Reporter, NBC will be livestreaming the Golden Globes online this year on both NBC\u2019s site and apps and any over-the-top TV service that offers NBC. This article has been updated with the new information.",

Now the third sister is sharing her thoughts.\n\u201cI wish that they would have come to us and we would have been involved since the beginning,\u201d Alyssa Milano said during an interview with Entertainment Tonight. \u201cBut having said that, I do hope that it reaches the newer generation and impacts that generation the way ours was able to do for its generation.\u201d\n\nThe CW greenlit the self-described \u201cfierce,\u201d \u201cfunny,\u201d \u201cfeminist\u201d reboot with Sarah Jeffery, Melonie Diaz, and Madeleine Mantock as three sisters who discover they\u2019re actually witches. They must then try to balance their life in a college town with supernatural demon-hunting.\n\nMilano costarred with Combs and Doherty in the original series. Rose McGowan came on as long-lost half sister Paige when Doherty\u2019s Prue character was killed off.\n\nCombs, especially, has been very vocal about the reboot. \u201cLet me say first that I appreciate the jobs and opportunities the Charmed reboot has created,\u201d she wrote, in part, through a statement. \u201cBut I will never understand what is fierce, funny, or feminist in creating a show that basically says the original actresses are too old to do a job they did 12 years ago. I hope the new show is far better than the marketing so the true legacy does remain.\u201d\n\nDoherty had also tweeted initially that the concept was \u201coffensive.\u201d She added, \u201cI love Charmed. I also want it to be respected. I\u2019m simply choosing to be constructive about it because negativity has no place in my life.\u201d\n\nThe new stars and producers have responded to the pushback, also coming from certain pockets of the original fans, multiple times. During the Television Critics Association tour, Mantock said, \u201cOf course, you can\u2019t help but feel disappointed because I think the script is fantastic. I really hope maybe [Combs will] see it and like it.\u201d\n\nExecutive producers Jennie Snyder Urman and Jessica O\u2019Toole also noted how the original show \u201cwrapped up everything up so wonderfully\u201d and they \u201cdidn\u2019t want to mess with that mythology, obviously, because it was eight years.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of us from the original cast to the original creators, producers, or writers have anything to do with it,\u201d Milano said in a recent interview with Parade. \u201cThe way I feel about it is this, and I\u2019ll just be super, super-honest: If the reboot can give the joy that it gave to our generation to a new generation, then I think that\u2019s really beautiful. Time after time, I\u2019ve heard story after story about how that show meant so much to people, because it was a show that they found while they were battling cancer, or it was a show that they watched with their father, and that was the only thing they could connect with. It really resonated with people in a profound way, and if a new generation can find that, then I think that\u2019s really beautiful.\u201d\n\nShe suggests the new showrunners \u201cshouldn\u2019t try to reinvent the wheel, but really take what was so great about the original and find a way to make it their own.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad that it\u2019s here finally, because we\u2019ve been hearing about this reboot for however many years, what has it been, maybe four years now?\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I feel like it\u2019s either going to succeed or not, and if it succeeds again, a whole new generation will be exposed to the beauty of what Charmed was able to be for people, and if it doesn\u2019t succeed, then we don\u2019t have to hear about it anymore.\u201d",

He wanted a lie in.\nTheroux told Mr Porter that he \"didn't bother\" to turn up, admitting: \"I slept in that day.\" He then went on to add that it was probably for the best because, had he got the gig, he \"wouldn't have been prepared for [the fame]\".\n\nThe actor, screenwriter and director (he co-wrote Tropic Thunder and Zoolander 2 with friend Ben Stiller) also revealed how Aniston often sense checks his jokes.\n\"When it's not funny, she calls me out.

Brown and Ryan Michelle Bathe\u2019s marriageWhat a gorgeous couple, and we love the story of how they met!  \nMarch 13, 2018May 9, 2023 by Anna Weaver \nActor Sterling K. Brown has become a household name in the past few years thanks to his work in high-profile projects like \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d\nBut to hear the 41-year-old star talk about his 10-year marriage to fellow actor Ryan Michelle Bathe, you realize he\u2019s also been lucky in love for a long time.\nListed below are seven things you might not have known about this adorable couple.\n1. They Met In College\nBoth Bathe and Brown were in the same year at Stanford, and even lived in the same dorm as freshmen, according to The Stanford Daily! They were also friends who performed in campus productions together before they started dating.\nWhen they got to know each other at college they discovered they were both from St. Louis, Missouri, and had even been born at the same hospital. Small world! The pair went on to grad school together at New York University.\n\n2. She Was Hard To Get\nAccording to what Brown told \u201cThe Talk,\u201d he and Bathe \u201cdated off and on\u201d for a while before breaking up for more than three years at one point. When Brown decided to finally try to win her back, he did things including chasing after her while she was jogging so he could convince her she was the love his life.\n\n3. They Have Two Cute Kids\nLike his character, Randall Pearson, from NBC\u2019s \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d Brown has two kids with his college-sweetheart wife. But, instead of two girls, they have two boys: 6-year-old Andrew and 2-year-old Amare. Bathe and Brown have shared cute stories about their sons, like how Andrew wants to be a scientist and has quite a personality.\n\n4. She Gave Birth At Home\nAccording to Brown, when Andrew came, Bathe had such a quick labor that she ended up just giving birth at home, with him helping her deliver their son. They told the story on the red carpet at the 2018 Golden Globe Awards and it\u2019s pretty hilarious.\n\n5. They Both Love Their Jobs\nBrown may be the breakout star of \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d but Bathe also has had a recurring role on the hit show. In the first season, she played Yvette, a black woman who first appeared in a memorable flashback scene at the public pool, advising Randall\u2019s adoptive mother Rebecca on how to properly take care of his hair.\nThat wasn\u2019t the first time the couple appeared onscreen together. Brown played the only male military spouse among the main cast of Lifetime\u2019s \u201cArmy Wives.\u201d And, in the show\u2019s sixth season, Bathe played the partner of an active duty soldier. They also appeared together in an episode of \u201cHarry\u2019s Law.\u201d However, the two apparently avoid rehearsing together, as they\u2019ve told E!.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned that there are certain minefields and pitfalls in our relationship that, like a slalom, we just move right on past them,\u201d Bathe told the network in 2017. \u201cAnd rehearsing together is one of those things.\u201d\n\n6. They Laugh A Lot\nBrown told Essence that a key to their marriage is that he and Bathe \u201ccrack each other up constantly!\u201d Brown is apparently a pretty funny guy when he\u2019s not making us cry \u2026 which is basically all the time.\n\n7. They Surround Themselves With Support\nBrown told ABC News that its key for his marriage that they have a community of people around them that supports he and Bathe. \u201cOne thing that I\u2019ve learned for any relationship to be successful is the people who are part of your life, they have to champion your union,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just you, not just her. They have to champion y\u2019all.\u201d\n\n8. They Clearly Admire One Another\nBrown says the sweetest things about Bathe in his award acceptance speeches. For example, at the 2018 Screen Actors Guild Awards, he gave a speech where he said, \u201cI love actors so much, I decided to marry one. Ryan Michelle Bathe, you\u2019re the best scene partner a brother\u2019s ever had.\u201d\nAnd when he was loudly played off the stage at the 2017 Emmys before finishing his speech, he made sure he thanked Bathe backstage.\nAnd Bathe seems like she couldn\u2019t be prouder of Brown\u2019s accomplishments.\nSo put Bathe and Brown up there with celebrity couples who make marriage look pretty darn good.",

        "post_text": "Katy Perry explains meaning of 'Swish Swish,' calls it 'great anthem'\nBut ... is it about Taylor Swift?\nBy\nNick Romano\nPublished on May 20, 2017\n\nThe collective internet seems to have already passed judgment on Katy Perry's new track, \"Swish Swish,\" which is raising eyebrows over its possible lyrical shots at Taylor Swift. Perry was even asked by Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show Friday whether this song, off her upcoming Witness album, was about \"anyone we know.\" While the pop diva remained cryptic, she explained the meaning of \"Swish Swish\" is \"liberation\" from bullies.\n\n\"I think it's a great anthem for people to use whenever someone's trying to hold you down or bully you,\" she said. \"That's kind of what this record is about, it's just like [a] 360-degree liberation.\" If \"Chained to the Rhythm\" was about \"political liberation\" and \"Bon App\u00e9tit\" was a \"sexual liberation,\" then Perry calls \"Swish Swish\" \"the liberation from all the negative that doesn't serve you.\"\n\nPerry directed her fans to the segment on social media Saturday morning. \"Here's some of the tea and a biscuit,\" she tweeted.\n\nSince \"Swish Swish\" dropped on Thursday, listeners, including Swift pal Ruby Rose, pointed to the lyrics as a diss track. \"I've always stood up for the people I love and against things I think are cheap or mean spirited. That's not new. You have to follow your [heart emoji],\" Rose wrote in a series of tweets.\n\nPerry and Swift have reportedly been feuding since an alleged spat over backup dancers a couple of years ago. Swift's 1989 hit \"Bad Blood\" has long been rumored to be a strike against Perry, and when asked by Entertainment Weekly if Witness included a response to the Swift song, Perry said it was \"not my question to answer\u2014if it's about me.\"\n\nShe further explained, \"I think [my new album is] a very empowered record. There is no one thing that's calling out any one person. One thing to note is: You can't mistake kindness for weakness and don't come for me. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. And that's not to any one person and don't quote me that it is, because it's not. It's not about that.\"\n\nWatch her latest explanation of \"Swish Swish\" on The Tonight Show above.",

Perez\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nTonya Harding has long denied she knew a plan was afoot to injure Nancy Kerrigan at the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships. That, actually, was not the case, Harding said in Truth and Lies: The Tonya Harding Story that aired on ABC on Thursday night. In fact, she said she basically figured out that her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly and his friend, Shawn Eckardt, had likely been behind the plot to attack Kerrigan shortly after she won the U.S. figure skating title. \n\nHarding stuck to her story that she's repeated for 24 years now: She had no role in planning the attack. In part of the interview that ran on Good Morning America earlier this week, Harding, however, said she did overhear Gillooly and Eckardt talking about \"taking somebody out\" to ensure Harding made the 1994 U.S. Olympic team. \n\n\"It popped in my head two or three days after we got back (that Gillooly and Eckardt were involved),\" Harding said in part of the interview that didn't run until the two-hour special Thursday night. \n\nMORE: Tonya Harding threatens to end interview with Piers Morgan\n\nThe special comes as I, Tonya, a sympathetic look at Harding's life that is in theaters, has received critical acclaim. But Harding's mother isn't fan. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a (expletive) about the movie,\" said LaVona \"Sandy\" Golden, who was played by Allison Janney in the movie. \"I don\u2019t care how it portrays me. I could care less about that movie than the dirt outside.\u201d\n\nMORE: Harding, mother give differing accounts of abuse, drinking\n\nJanney, who won the best supporting actress in a motion picture at the Golden Globes on Sunday, portrayed Golden as a physically and mentally abusive mother. Golden admitted to using a hairbrush to \"spank\" Harding at a competition, but denied she was habitually abusive toward Harding. Golden also denied she ever threw a steak knife that struck Harding in the arm during an argument. \n\n\u201cTake a lie detector (expletive),\" Harding said in response to her mother's denials. \n\nMORE: 5 things we learned on the set of the crazy Tonya Harding biopic 'I, Tonya'\n\nKerrigan bristled during her short segment on the special when asked if her popularity is owed to the attack in Detroit. \n\n\"I have two Olympics medals,\" Kerrigan said. \"They didn\u2019t just give them to me. I worked hard for it. Who in their right mind would ask to be attacked? I would never wish that anyone. If I could change that, would I? Of course I would.\u201d\n\nHarding didn't deny the incident helped create more of a buzz around U.S. women's figure skating. \n\n\"Sure. Why not?\" Harding said. \"I mean, I was there. I skated.\u201d\n\nHarding was convicted of hindering the prosecution in the aftermath of the attack on Kerrigan. She was spared prison time, unlike Gillooly, Eckardt and two men who carried out the attack (Shane Stant and getaway driver Derrick Smith). \n\n\"Enough apologizing,\" Harding said. \"She has her life. I have my life. We both have wonderful lives. That should be all that matters.\" \n\nPHOTOS: Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan",

Renee Zellweger\u2019s team is denouncing allegations that she had inappropriate encounters with Harvey Weinstein in order to escalate her career.\nThe claims came to light in a class-action lawsuit that six unnamed women recently filed against Weinstein, alleging that Zellweger, 48, and Charlize Theron both ascended in their professional endeavors by performing \u201csexual favors\u201d for Weinstien, 65.\n\u201cIf Harvey said that, he\u2019s full of shit,\u201d a rep for the Bridget Jones actress, who has starred in several films produced by the former studio exec, including Cold Mountain which she won an Oscar for in 2004, told Us Weekly in a statement on Wednesday, December 7.\nWeinstein responded to the claims in a statement to Us on Monday, December 11: \u201cMr. Weinstein vehemently denies these accusations and has never stated he slept with any of them. It\u2019s ridiculous that anyone would believe these talented women, Academy Award winners, provided sexual favors in exchange for roles they earned based on their talent and brilliant work. It\u2019s simply not true.\u201d\nAs previously reported, the former Miramax producer made headlines in October after nearly 30 years of sexual assault and abuse allegations came to light in expos\u00e9s published by The New York Times and The New Yorker. North of 60 women have accused Weinstein of misconduct to date and he has since been faced with several lawsuits and expelled from the Television Academy. The filmmaker spent a brief period of time in a sexual rehabilitation facility in Arizona after the allegations surfaced in October. The scandal has inspired more women to come forward with their own alleged accounts of sexual abuse in Hollywood.\n\nWeinstein\u2019s wife, Georgina Chapman, announced she was leaving him one week after NYT published its story. Alyssa Milano, who costarred as a judge alongside Chapman on Project Runway: All Stars, gave an update on the British fashion designer, 41, during an appearance on Megan Kelly Today on Wednesday, December 6. \n\n\u201cGeorgina is doing very well. She\u2019s an amazing mother. She\u2019s an amazing woman,\u201d the Charmed alum, 44, said. \u201cI think her priority right now is focusing on how to raise those two children to the best of her capacity, given the situation. She goes through very dark times. She\u2019s very sad. This is not easy for her, but I have no doubt that not only will she come out on the other side of this, but she deserves to. She\u2019s a good woman.\u201d\n\nChapman shares two children, India, 7, and Dashiell, 4, with Weinstein, who she wed in 2007.",

And according to the man in the middle of the action, Arie Luyendyk Jr., things heat up pretty quickly.\n\nSitting down to chat with E! News, the reality star discussed how things will be different for him this time around. Thanks to his age (at 36, he\u2019s older and wiser than when he first appeared on our screens in 2012) and his new career (he\u2019s still a race car driver, but is doing real estate as well), he seems to be pretty sure of where he\u2019s coming from and what he wants out of this romantic situation.\n\nWhich is not to say he won\u2019t slip up every once in a while. In fact, he did just that on night one of The Bachelor, when he broke a rule he made for himself before the season started.\n\n\u201cThat first night, I told myself I\u2019m NOT going to kiss anybody,\u201d Luyendyk Jr. told E!

Pennsylvania student Allison Closs couldn\u2019t find a living, breathing date for her dance, so she decided to order one online. In a YouTube post about it, she said:\n\nI couldn\u2019t find myself a date in real life or with an actual human. So I bought one on Amazon. I have always loved Danny. I loved him on It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, I loved him in Hercules and Matilda. I just love him in every form he takes.\n\nDanny was there for me when I really needed him. He treats me the way a woman should be treated.\n\nIn the video, she \u2018interviewed\u2019 her dad, who told her that though he\u2019s a \u201clittle bit older\u2026\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s a very nice man and I think he\u2019s going to treat [his daughter] with a lot of respect.\n\nThe initial video went viral and people viewed it thousands of times. Closs\u2019 photo with cardboard DeVito was shared widely online \u2013 it was even upvoted more than 100,000 times on Reddit.\n\nIn fact, it spread far and wide \u2013 and waltzed right onto Danny DeVito\u2019s radar. The veteran actor\u2019s It\u2019s Always Sunny co-star Rob McElhenney spotted her picture and DeVito felt compelled to respond in kind:\n\nI heard you took cardboard Danny to Prom. What a coincidence. He took cardboard Allison to Paddy's [the pub in It's Always Sunny].\n\nSlide for IRL Danny >>>\n\nAnd when Closs found out about DeVito's homage to her, well, the wonderful story came full circle.\n\nThe internet is a great thing, sometimes.",

        "post_text": "Minnie Driver is once again calling out her former costar and boyfriend Matt Damon for his previous comments about sexual misconduct in Hollywood and beyond.\nIn December, Damon told ABC News that the alleged sexual misconduct of powerful men represented a \u201cspectrum of behavior,\u201d explaining that he believes there is \u201ca difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation. Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn\u2019t be conflated.\u201d\nHe also said, \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories and it\u2019s totally necessary.\u201d\nDriver, who criticized Damon for the comments at the time, told the New York Times on Tuesday that she feels Damon \u201crepresented every intelligent, nice white male who feels it is their job to comment on the way that women metabolize stuff.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cThat somehow we should have a hierarchical system whereby touch on the arse is this, tits is this, you know, front bottom, back bottom, over the shirt, rape! That there would be some criteria.\u201d\nDriver advocated for involving men in the women\u2019s movement, saying \u201cthere\u2019s no way to move forward unless we do this together.\u201d\nIn January, Damon apologized for his controversial comments, telling the Today show, \u201cI really wish I\u2019d listened a lot more before I weighed in on this. Ultimately what it is for me is that I don\u2019t want to further anybody\u2019s pain. With anything that I do or say, so for that I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\nDriver also told the NYT she supported a \u201cmodel of truth and reconciliation,\u201d referring to commissions that were established after the Rwandan genocide and South African apartheid, in which victims of violence were given a platform to speak.\n\u201cWomen get to be heard,\u201d she explained. \u201cYou get to be seen and heard and the accusers get to hear that and get to metabolize that and then there is due process and then there is healing.\u201d\nDriver, who costarred with Damon in 1997\u2019s Good Will Hunting, also spoke again about how the film\u2019s producer, now-disgraced mogul Harvey Weinstein, did not want to cast her in the film.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to cast me,\u201d she said, explaining that the casting director didn\u2019t think she was attractive enough to have sex with. \u201cI got off lightly with him. I really did,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen we talk about sexual harassment, it\u2019s not about sex, it\u2019s about power.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Weinstein previously said that the producer did pull for Ashley Judd to star in the role that ultimately went to Driver, but denied that Driver was considered not attractive enough for the part.\n\u201cWhile Ashley was the top choice for Miramax and Mr. Weinstein, the role went to Minnie Driver, who was the star and director\u2019s preference,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cMinnie did a brilliant job and he believes Ashley would have as well.\u201d\nLast year, Driver opened up about her own experience with sexual assault as a teen. \u201cWhen I was [17], I was on vacation in Greece, and this guy, kinda elbow-grabbed me, and said \u2018You\u2019re going to dance with me,\u2019\u201d she said on Sirius XM\u2019s StandUP! with Pete Dominick. \u201cI said \u2018no\u2019 and I pulled my arm away from him, and he grabbed me by the back of my hair. I tried to kick him, and then he punched me.\u201d",

My heart will never get over this.\u201d\n\nNicks also went on to reveal how after the ceremony last year \u2014 where Petty was the night\u2019s honoree \u2014 the late singer spent a lot of time \u201ctalking to me about how important it was to him. And maybe he was talking about it because [he] was ill. He was not well.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he fought his way through that tour,\u201d Nicks continued, referencing the 40th anniversary tour with the Heartbreakers that Petty embarked on in 2016, and finished just one week before he died on Oct. 2 of that year.\n\n\u201cHe should\u2019ve canceled, and he should\u2019ve just gone home and gone to the hospital. But not Tom. He was gonna go down that river. And so, God bless him, he finished his tour at the Hollywood Bowl. Three shows. And one week later he died \u2014 but he got down the river,\u201d she added as she began to choke up. \u201cSo Tom, I know you\u2019re standing next to me cause you always have been for so many years.\u201d\n\nThe event was also attended by Harry Styles, Lorde, Imagine Dragons, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Miley Cyrus.\n\nEarlier in January, it was revealed that Petty died of an accidental drug overdose.\n\nIn a statement posted on the late singer\u2019s website, his family said the 66-year-old had been using a number of medications, including opioid pain medication fentanyl.\n\nPetty died of \u201cmulti-system organ failure\u201d caused by \u201cmixed drug toxicity,\u201d according to the autopsy report released by the Los Angeles County Coroner. During an examination on Oct. 3, the medical examiner found fentanyl, oxycodone, temazepam, alprazolam, citalopram, acetylfentanyl and despropionyl fentanyl. Petty was also suffering from coronary artery atherosclerosis and emphysema.\n\n\u201cOur family sat together this morning with the Medical Examiner \u2013 Coroner\u2019s office and we were informed of their final analysis that Tom Petty passed away due to an accidental drug overdose as a result of taking a variety of medications,\u201d Petty\u2019s family said in a statement, signed by widow Dana and daughter Adria, 42.\n\nPetty\u2019s longtime manager previously released a statement at the time of the musician\u2019s death explaining that Petty suffered cardiac arrest at his home in Malibu, California, on Oct. 2 and was taken to UCLA Medical Center but could not be revived.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately Tom\u2019s body suffered from many serious ailments including emphysema, knee problems and most significantly a fractured hip. On the day he died he was informed his hip had graduated to a full-on break and it is our feeling that the pain was simply unbearable and was the cause for his overuse of medication,\u201d the family said in their January statement.\n\n\u201cWe knew before the report was shared with us that he was prescribed various pain medications for a multitude of issues including fentanyl patches and we feel confident that this was, as the coroner found, an unfortunate accident,\u201d the family continued.\n\n\u201cAs a family we recognize this report may spark a further discussion on the opioid crisis and we feel that it is a healthy and necessary discussion and we hope in some way this report can save lives. Many people who overdose begin with a legitimate injury or simply do not understand the potency and deadly nature of these medications,\u201d the Petty family said.\n\nThey added, \u201cOn a positive note we now know for certain he went painlessly and beautifully exhausted after doing what he loved the most, for one last time, performing live with his unmatchable rock band for his loyal fans on the biggest tour of his 40 plus year career. He was extremely proud of that achievement in the days before he passed.\u201d",

Pitt is seeing the children regularly.\n\nJolie \u201ccontinues to support the reconciliation of the children with Brad and everything she does is focused on healing her family,\u201d a source close to Jolie, who was not authorized to speak publicly, tells USA TODAY.\n\nBut what a road to get to this point.\n\nA messy summer\n\nIn June, their divorce made headlines again when the couple's private judge threatened Jolie, saying if the actress doesn't start encouraging her children to forge relationships with her ex, she could be in danger of losing custody.\n\nThe judge further ordered Jolie to arrange a phone call with the kids and their doctors to explain to the children that \u201cthe court has determined that each of them are safe with their father.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I imagine is difficult for Angelina is, how can somebody else override a parent\u2019s decision? How can a judge tell her as a mom what\u2019s best for her children? That\u2019s the consequence on not agreeing with the other parent and submitting it to a judge,\u201d says Melcher.\n\nThe lawyer adds: \"Maybe she knows something nobody else does, but the judge did not agree with her. And ultimately, the judge makes these decisions.\"\n\nMore: The highest-paid actresses in the world: Johansson, Jolie, Aniston\n\nAnd so it got uglier. With both stars asserting they wanted to move forward in dissolving their marriage (a process known as bifurcation), Jolie\u2019s new lawyer, Samantha Bley DeJean, accused Pitt of not having paid \u201cmeaningful\" child support in court documents.\n\nAs the news went viral, Pitt\u2019s lawyers quickly countered, detailing an $8 million housing loan plus $1.3 million in child care paid since their split. Pitt's lawyer, Lance Spiegel, called the legal maneuvering \"a thinly veiled effort to manipulate media coverage.\"\n\nBut Jolie's lawyer doubled down, indicating that not only was Pitt charging the mother of his children interest on her new home, but he was also not paying half their expenses.\n\nImage-wise, all of this matters: In the past two years, Jolie\u2019s negative Q score, the industry's most commonly used measure of likability, has gone up four points. Pitt's negative score has remained static.\n\n\u201cWhatever\u2019s been happening in the media, he\u2019s been dealing with it better, based on the data,\u201d says Henry Schafer, executive vice president of Q Score. \"It looks like based on consumer reaction that he\u2019s weathering the storm much better than she is.\u201d\n\nThe downfall of Brangelina \n\nThe uber-private, A-list couple married in 2014 after a decade of globe-trotting and children together, but the facade shattered in September 2016, when Jolie filed for divorce citing the \"health of her family\" after a private plane ride in which Pitt was alleged to have had a physical altercation with their eldest child, Maddox, who is now 17.\n\nIn the months that followed, each staffed up with power lawyers and various advisers. Allegations flew in the media and legal documents were leaked from family court. Pitt, who was cleared of child abuse allegations, confessed a serious drinking problem to GQ, saying he was now sober.\n\nThe two appeared to reach a detente in January 2017, releasing a joint statement stating they had agreed to handle their divorce privately and would work together to reunify their family. (California law favors joint custody in divorce cases.)\n\nMore: Lawyer seeks to sue Brad Pitt's Make It Right foundation over houses in New Orleans\n\nThen this June came, with their judge dressing down Jolie for withholding access to their children. (The court is allowing Maddox to decide how much time he wants to spend with his father. Their other five children are Pax, 14; Zahara, 13; Shiloh, 12; and 10-year old twins Vivienne and Knox.)\n\n\"They\u2019re not healing from divorce. They\u2019re healing from some ... from life, from things in life,\" Jolie told Vanity Fair in September 2017.\n\nIn late August, Jolie officially split from her Los Angeles divorce attorney, Laura Wasser, and hired DeJean, a San Francisco-based attorney whose \"expertise is the protection and best interest of children,\u201d said Jolie's rep, Mindy Nyby, at the time.\n\nFamily law attorney Jeffrey Cohen of New York's Cohen Goldstein calls such positioning \"an adversarial stand. This is a sign of the deterioration of the litigation, of the relationships. It looks like it's heading south.\"\n\nAnd it could it get worse. If Jolie and Pitt can\u2019t bury the hatchet, there\u2019s a chance their custody battle could end up at trial, creating a media storm neither star's image will be able to weather.\n\nPitt told GQ in May 2017 he knew such an outcome would be a \u201cspectacular\u201d nightmare for everyone involved.\n\n\"I see it happen to friends \u2013 I see where the one spouse literally can't tell their own part in it, and is still competing with the other in some way and wants to destroy them and needs vindication by destruction, and just wasting years on that hatred,\" said Pitt then. \"I don't want to live that way.\"\n\nTo that end, compromise could be around the corner. \"Almost every case is settled in the hallway between the parties,\" says Melcher.\n\nAnd there are a million reasons to go that way.\n\n\u201cIf it goes to an open trial (with) public proceedings, this would be as juicy as they come,\u201d says Cohen. \u201cThese are two of the most well-known actors on the planet.\u201d",

Hawkins\nOct 15, 2017\n9:58 am\n\nA former member of the hit-making Pussycat Dolls, Kaya Jones, airs out the group\u2019s dirty laundry. \n\nIn case you missed it, the singer recently took to Twitter where she alleged that her former group mates were a part of a prostitution ring. \u201cMy truth. I wasn\u2019t in a girl group. I was in a prostitution ring. Oh & we happened to sing & be famous. While everyone who owned us made the $,\u201d she began. \u201cHow bad was it? People ask\u2014bad enough that I walked away from my dreams, my band mates & a 13 million dollar record deal. We knew we were going to be #1.\u201d\n\nJones, 33, took it one step further, calling out her \u201cden mother\u201d by writing, \u201cI want the den mother from hell to confess why another 1 of her girl group girls committed suicide? Tell the public how you mentally broke us.\u201d\n\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t long before fans suggested that the singer was referring to G.R.L. singer Simone Battle, who committed suicide in September of 2014.\n\n\u201cTo be a part of the team you must be a team player. Meaning sleep with whoever they say. If you don\u2019t they have nothing on you to leverage\u2026Yes I said leverage. Meaning after they turn you out or get you hooked on drugs they use it against you. Correct. Victimizing the victim again,\u201d continued Jones. \u201cThat\u2019s why I have so much respect for our military. I\u2019ve been through way. But my scars you can\u2019t see. At least real war is honest. Why don\u2019t we report it? Because we were all abused! I personally have been warned if I tell I will\u2026you know end up dead or no more career.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, neither a rep for the Pussycat Dolls nor Nicole Scherzinger has commented on Jones\u2019 allegations.\n\nHowever, Asia Nitollano, who was briefly a part of the group in 2007, took to Twitter to write, \u201cWho is Kaya Jones? Lol She was not apart of The Pussycat Dolls the recording group so I do not know her. If she was in the Vegas show then I know nothing about that nor have I ever heard such a thing. But judging from google she looks like she just wants her 15min of fame. (Side note\u2026 it says she\u2019s a Trump supporter\u2026 but yet she\u2019s Canadian, which means her vote doesn\u2019t count!!!! ) Same with this comment about The Pussycat Dolls; she wasn\u2019t in the group so her opinion doesn\u2019t count!!!!\u201d \n\nWhat are your thoughts on the claims surrounding the former hit-makers? Sound off in the comment section below.",

The couple had a low-key ceremony at a private home in Hidden Hills, California, according to the site. The nuptials\u2014which took place almost five months after Meghan and Prince Harry's royal wedding\u2014were so secretive that barely any photos from the event surfaced online. But a few Instagram Stories captured by DailyMailTV give a glimpse at Engelson and Kurland's big day.\n\nThe images show Engelson wearing a light pink shirt under a gray-blue suit, with the bride in an off-the-shoulder, knee-length white dress with layered gold bracelets. She wore her hair in loose ombr\u00e9 waves. \n\nMarkle and Engelson were married from 2011 to 2013. They had a getaway wedding in 2011 in Ocho Rios, Jamaica with 102 guests, according to Us Weekly. For the beachfront nuptials, the bride wore a strapless sheath gown with a notch neckline and bejeweled belt. The laid-back, bohemian-inspired look was fitting for the shoreside venue, but a far cry from the Givenchy Haute Couture gown Markle had custom-made for her royal wedding to Prince Harry.\n\nEngelson's engagement to Kurland was reported in June, just weeks after Meghan and Harry tied the knot. The producer announced the news on Instagram, although his account is private. \"Luckiest guy I know! Get ready to party!\" he wrote in a post. Meghan and Harry have been to a number of weddings together since becoming a couple; they attended a friend's nuptials months after celebrating their own and are expected to be at Princess Eugenie's ceremony this Friday.\n\nErica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.

The incident was confirmed by Microsoft, which reported that a group typically associated with the Russian government managed to view source code and gain limited access to certain company emails.\n\nThis breach is part of a broader series of cyberattacks targeting U.S. corporations, government agencies, and think tanks, attributed to Russia by the U.S. government. Microsoft has not disclosed the exact content of the emails accessed but clarified that the hackers did not compromise the security of its products or services. The company has taken steps to secure its systems and is working with other affected entities to mitigate any potential impacts.\n\nThe revelation from Microsoft aligns with warnings from U.S. cybersecurity officials about a sophisticated Russian campaign utilizing various tactics to infiltrate a wide range of U.S. targets. The incident highlights the ongoing digital espionage efforts by state-sponsored actors and underscores the need for robust cybersecurity defenses in both private and public sectors.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s swift response to the cyber intrusion illustrates the company's preparedness in dealing with such security threats. However, it also serves as a reminder of the persistent and evolving cyber risks that major corporations face in an increasingly interconnected world.",

The New York Times and the New Yorker first published investigative pieces in 2017 that accused disgruntled movie producer Harvey Weinstein of decades of sexual assault and harassment. Soon after, Weinstein stood trial and was [\u2026] \nThe 39-year-old is nominated for the SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role for The Disaster Artist.

And as we near the end of the hour, it\u2019s unclear what will happen to the younger Pearson man \u2014 especially since they brothers have only 48 left to spend together.\n\nWe cut back to the present day, where Kevin (Justin Hartley) and his girlfriend Zoe (Melanie Liburd) have been diving into his father and (supposedly late) uncle\u2019s past in the small village in Vietnam where Jack was stationed.\nThere is a loud explosion and Jack goes running to find Nicky, with one of the soldiers noting that, \u201cA boat exploded. I think one of our guys was on it.\u201d Jack dives into the water and begins to swim toward a scene we can\u2019t see.\n\nWe come back to Kevin in the present, where the translator who was helping him communicate with a local historian, mentions casually he was going to suggest something Kevin could bring home to lay on his uncle\u2019s war memorial one day \u2014 but then he found out his uncle isn\u2019t dead. \n\u201cNone of your family died in the war,\u201d he says, telling him he checked the war memorial database, Nicholas Pearsons\u2019 name isn\u2019t there. He didn\u2019t die in Vietnam \u2014 at least not in the war, anyway.\n\nThen we cut to the interior of a trailer, where a man \u2014 played by Griffin Dunne \u2014 is taking off his coat. The camera focuses on a piece of mail that is addressed to \u201cNicholas Pearson\u201d and sent to his residence in Bradford, Pennsylvania.\nYep, Nicky is alive and well \u2014 and when the show returns next year, he\u2019ll be played in the present day by Dunne.\nAnd, we bet, Kevin is probably going to come looking for him. \n\n\u201cThis Is Us\u201d will return Jan. 15 on NBC.",
