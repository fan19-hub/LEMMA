Kennedy Jr. secretly met Princess Diana in New York, and ever since, there has been much speculation over exactly what happened in her suite at the Carlyle Hotel that day. According to RoseMarie Terenzio, JFK Jr.\u2019s executive assistant who accompanied him to the hotel that day, the hour and half-long meeting in Diana\u2019s suite was way more innocent than those rumors would have you believe, People reports.\n\nThe two simply talked about Diana appearing on the cover of JFK Jr.\u2019s political magazine George, but organizing the meeting wasn\u2019t easy at all.\n\n\u201cI remember him saying, \u2018There\u2019s no way someone is not going to leak it. There\u2019s going to be paparazzi everywhere,\u2019\u201d Terenzio said. \u201cSomeone suggested he go in disguise and I said, \u2018That\u2019s ridiculous. You\u2019re not doing that!\u2019\u201d\n\nThankfully JFK Jr. agreed, and he and Terenzio figured out the best way to get into the Carlyle unnoticed.\n\n\u201cI had remembered that the last time I had been to the Carlyle for an event, there had been no photographers at the front entrance,\u201d Terenzio told People. \u201cSo I told John, \u2018Don\u2019t go in the side entrance, because if anyone does leak it beforehand, people will expect you to go in the side. So walk in the front door.\u2019\u201d\n\nTurns out Terenzio was right and the two celebrities walked straight into the hotel while the photographers were camped out at the side door.\n\nEven though JFK Jr. had a \u201crespectful piece\u201d in mind, according to Terenzio, the story never ended up happening. \u201cShe wrote John a note that said, \u2018Thank you so much, but not right now,'\u201d Terenzio recalls. After the meeting, JFK Jr. \"was very careful what he said,\" George magazine creative director Matt Berman told People. \u201cThe one funny thing he said was, \u2018She\u2019s got a great pair of legs.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile he might not have mentioned that to his assistant, \u201cI do remember him saying, \u2018She\u2019s really tall!\u2019\u201d Terenzio says. \u201cHe also said she was very shy. He was surprised how demure she was. I think they had both met Mother Theresa so they spoke about that. And he said how lovely she was.\u201d",

They had such a passionate love affair. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s easy for her to get over, not without a fight to match the size of their love. The fact is, Angelina\u2019s deeply hurt that they couldn\u2019t keep things together and have their happy Hollywood ending and she puts all the blame for that failure on Brad.\u201d\n\nPerhaps this explains the nasty turn Brad and Angelina\u2019s custody battle has taken, with her lobbing allegations of unpaid child support at her ex. \u201cInstead of facing her sadness and working through it,\u201d the source tells HollywoodLife.com, \u201cher coping mechanism is to go full ice queen. Sadly it is the only way she can get through this divorce. If she doesn\u2019t focus on her anger and stay in that frame of mind, she would crumble and possibly even have a breakdown.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not an option\u201d for Angie, the source added. \u201cShe has to stay strong for her kids and unfortunately for Brad, \u2018staying strong\u2019 means \u2018staying angry.\u2019 \u201c Angie\u2019s anger, while helping her keep it together for her kids, but actually backfire and cost her the one thing she\u2019s trying to protect. Angelina\u2019s \u201ccarefully word-smithed\u201d accusation \u2013 where she claimed Brad didn\u2019t pay \u201cmeaningful\u201d child support \u2013 might come off as insincere to the judge overseeing the case, California family law attorney David Pisarra EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it backfires on her, as more and more judges are starting to see through these tactics quicker.\u201d\n\nBrad \u2013 who has denied the accusations by saying he\u2019s paid more than $9 million to Angelina \u2013 can\u2019t stand the fact that she\u2019s taken the battle public again. Brad fears that the added spotlight to this battle\u2019s bitterness is \u201churting the kids,\u201d and that nothing good can come from a nasty custody dispute. He was coping with the breakup when everything was sealed behind clothes doors, but now that it\u2019s out in the open, Brad feels like she\u2019s \u201ctaken off the gloves and is fighting dirty.\u201d",

        "post_text": "Here\u2019s Sen. John McCain\u2019s full statement on not supporting Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy\u2019s Obamacare repeal bill, issued Sept. 22, 2017. \nAs I have repeatedly stressed, health care reform legislation ought to be the product of regular order in the Senate. Committees of jurisdiction should mark up legislation with input from all committee members, and send their bill to the floor for debate and amendment. That is the only way we might achieve bipartisan consensus on lasting reform, without which a policy that affects one-fifth of our economy and every single American family will be subject to reversal with every change of administration and congressional majority.\nI would consider supporting legislation similar to that offered by my friends Senators Graham and Cassidy were it the product of extensive hearings, debate and amendment. But that has not been the case. Instead, the specter of September 30th budget reconciliation deadline has hung over this entire process.\nWe should not be content to pass health care legislation on a party-line basis, as Democrats did when they rammed Obamacare through Congress in 2009. If we do so, our success could be as short-lived as theirs when the political winds shift, as they regularly do. The issue is too important, and too many lives are at risk, for us to leave the American people guessing from one election to the next whether and how they will acquire health insurance. A bill of this impact requires a bipartisan approach.\nSenators Alexander and Murray have been negotiating in good faith to fix some of the problems with Obamacare. But I fear that the prospect of one last attempt at a strictly Republican bill has left the impression that their efforts cannot succeed. I hope they will resume their work should this last attempt at a partisan solution fail.\nI cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal. I believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried. Nor could I support it without knowing how much it will cost, how it will effect insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it. Without a full CBO score, which won\u2019t be available by the end of the month, we won\u2019t have reliable answers to any of those questions.\n\nI take no pleasure in announcing my opposition. Far from it. The bill\u2019s authors are my dear friends, and I think the world of them. I know they are acting consistently with their beliefs and sense of what is best for the country. So am I.\nI hope that in the months ahead, we can join with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to arrive at a compromise solution that is acceptable to most of us, and serves the interests of Americans as best we can.",

In a preview clip for the hit NBC series\u2019 season 12, debuting Monday, February 27, the four judges reveal their biggest musical influences growing up and give a hint of what\u2019s to come during the upcoming competition. Spoiler alert: It involves puppets.\nFrom Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux to Nina Dobrev and Ian Somerhalder, see which stars have found love on set\n\u201cWhat got me into music is, I think, what got us all into music \u2014 music playing all around you when you were a kid,\u201d Alicia Keys says. \u201cMy mother had a pretty impressive record collection, and I remember Sundays being a time when a lot of music was played.\u201d Keys is basically right, since Adam Levine credits his parents buying a single for him that he played \u201cevery single day.\u201d And Shelton says his brother influenced his own taste by default; because his brother played his music so loud, Shelton had no choice but to listen to it as well.\nSee Hollywood's inseparable wingmen\nOnly Stefani cites something other than family as inspiring her early on. \u201cMy biggest musical inspiration was The Sound of Music,\u201d she reveals. \u201cIt inspired me in music and in fashion and for the rest of my life.\u201d The bubbly blonde also added that the show doesn\u2019t have \u201cany kind of boundaries, so anything can go.\u201d Considering her romance with Shelton, that seems like an accurate statement \u2026 but he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it.\n\nWhile trying to persuade a contestant to team up with her in a preview clip from an upcoming episode, Stefani notes, \u201cI just did a country song with Blake Shelton, so I\u2019ve got the hookup!\u201d \nShelton quickly chimes in to chide her for talking about their extracurricular relationship. \u201cThat is so inappropriate to be talking about our hookup!\u201d the country music star jokes. At least it seems like he was joking. Also, for some unknown reason, at one point, Stefani has a puppet version of Levine that she uses to mock him; no word yet on whether she has a puppet version of her boyfriend.\nTell Us: Which coach do you think will win season 12 of The Voice? \n\nThe Voice returns to NBC Monday, February 27, at 8 p.m. ET.",

Dating the director was different. We\u2019d be on the [press] tour together, I\u2019d come back to the hotel, and the last thing I want to talk about or think about is a movie.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe comes back from the tour, and that\u2019s all he wants to talk about and I get it,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s his baby.

I was doing double duty trying to be a supportive partner, while also being like, \u2018Can I please, for the love of God, not think about mother! for one second?\u2019\u201d\n\nLawrence said that reading the reviews made her be extra protective of him, so she had to put an end to it. \u201cI finally was just like, \u2018It\u2019s not healthy. Neither of us are doing it because if I read it, I start getting defensive.\u2019 Especially because it\u2019s my man,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome, what we did \u2014 some people hate it and the people who hate it, really hate it. But it\u2019s nothing that needs to be defended and if I read a negative review, I just feel defensive.\u201d\n\nThe American Hustle actress and the Black Swan director, 48, first met on the set of the psychological horror film. They sparked dating rumors in September 2016, and two months later they were spotted kissing in New York City. \u201cThey get along really well,\u201d a source told Us at the time.\n\nIn September, Lawrence spoke about the director in an interview with Vogue: \u201cWe had energy.

Penned by Derek Kolstad and directed by Chad Stahelski, the (presumably) final chapter in the Keanu Reeves action franchise is set to open on May 17, 2019. I have no idea if Berry is playing a villain or a fellow anti-hero, but A) it's cool that the (presumed) female lead will be about as old the male lead (she is 51 and he is 53, neither of them looks a day over 27) and B) I'm a huge fan of Berry's recent pulp fiction endeavors (The Call and Kidnap), so this is pretty cool casting.\n\nLionsgate also just announced that Angelica Houston, Asia Kate Dillon (TVs Billions and Orange is the New Black), Mark Dacascos (Lucky Day, Hawaii 5-0, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.), and Jason Mantzoukas (The Long Dumb Road, The House) will join the cast of John Wick: Chapter 3. Yes, Laurence Fishburne, Ian McShane and Lance Reddick will return as well. I'm not sure if Ruby Rose survived her encounters with Mr. Wick in part two, but I kinda hope she comes back too. What this arguably means is that Lionsgate may end up emphasizing an ensemble cast this time out, as opposed to the first two films which were (understandably) the Keanu Reeves Show.\n\nThat's no shade on Mr. Wick or the actor who plays him, but as I noted in the last post about the Mission: Impossible franchise, there is perhaps a greater value, at least for overseas box office, in ensemble action flicks as opposed to solo/lone-wolf movies. Think Deadpool 2,  xXx: Return of Xander Cage, Fate of the Furious and Avengers: Infinity War. Even Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was sold as a four-person adventure, highlighting Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan.\n\nSo, if Lionsgate feels that they can get more overseas bucks the third-go around (John Wick: Chapter 2 made $92 million domestic and $79m overseas) by offering something resembling an ensemble cast, well, that's one option on the table. That doesn't mean that John Wick will go about recruit a super-assassin squad to deal with that pesky \"everyone wants to kill me now\" status quo from the end of the last John Wick, but I will be interested to see how these new cast members are integrated into the new movie. And yeah, bringing Halle Berry onboard is a nice touch.\n\nCome what may, John Wick: Chapter 3 opens next year. Even as someone who thought that John Wick: Chapter 2 ended on a pretty definitive note (not unlike The Dark Knight or The Last Jedi), I'm still curious to see what the Wick crew has up their sleeve for a threequel.",

Josh Duhamel finally responds to those Jennifer Garner dating rumors and he can't stop smiling!\n\nBy: Jenna Lemoncelli Reading Time: 2 minute.\nMarch 15, 2018 9:55AM EDT\n\nJosh Duhamel, 45, and Jennifer Garner, 45, are the same age, they\u2019re both in the business and they\u2019re both single. So, when rumors began to swirl that the two Hollywood A-listers were dating, fans went wild. However, you can pump the breaks on that one, because, although Duhamel thinks his Love, Simon co-star is \u201cincredible,\u201d he\u2019s laughing off those pesky dating rumors. \u201cIt does truly amaze me what some of the things that are printed,\u201d Duhamel told E! News at the premiere of the movie in Los Angeles on March 13. \u201cIt\u2019s like, how is that even legal? I try not to comment on it. It is what it is and it\u2019s part of the business. We\u2019re in the circus and that\u2019s part of being in the circus.\u201d\n\nWhile Duhamel is not dating Garner, their friendship is thriving \u2014 Hence their chemistry on-screen. \u201cHer kids weren\u2019t on set, neither were mine. We were only there for I think, a week and a half, two weeks, working, but I went to Jen a couple times asking advice on certain things and she\u2019s an incredible woman, she really is,\u201d Duhamel revealed. \u201cShe\u2019s very, very smart. She\u2019s a lot funnier than I think people realize.\u201d\n\nThe two star in the new drama, Love, Simon, where they play the parents of a gay teenage son named Simon, played by Nick Robinson. Simon has kept his sexuality secret, even from his family. Meanwhile, he has fallen in love with a fellow, anonymous closeted classmate after exchanging emails with them. Then a blackmailer finds the emails and threatens to out Simon.\n\nAlthough Duhamel may not be romancing Garner, another report claims he is smitten with another actress. He\u2019s reportedly dating Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez, 28, , according to Us Weekly, which claims the two met at Jennifer Lopez\u2018s pre-Super Bowl concert. Gonz\u00e1lez has been romantically linked Liam Hemsworth, 28, and Calvin Harris, 34.\n\nFergie and Josh announced their split on September 14, 2017 after eight years of marriage and 13 years together. \u201cWith absolute love and respect we decided to separate as a couple earlier this year,\u201d the two said in a joint statement relayed by Fergie\u2019s rep. \u201cTo give our family the best opportunity to adjust, we wanted to keep this a private matter before sharing it with the public. We are and will always be united in our support of each other and our family.\u201d Despite their untimely ending, both Fergie and Josh remain good friends and continue to successfully co-parent their 4-year-old son Axl Jack.\n\nMeanwhile, Jennifer and her now ex-husband, Ben Affleck, 44, separated in 2015 after 10 years of marriage. They share three children together \u2014 Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 5, who they too, like Fergie and Josh, continue co-parent their kids as good friends. Ben and Jen officially filed for divorce in April 2017, with Jen reportedly making the first move.",

        "post_text": "Anna Wintour Net Worth\n\n$50 Million\n\nAnna Wintour's Salary\n\n$4 Million\n\nAnna Wintour is an American magazine editor and fashion news icon. Anna Wintour has a net worth of $50 million. Her annual salary as Editor of Vogue is $4 million. She is considered one of the most influential figures in the fashion industry. She served as the iconic (albeit not very flattering) inspiration for the popular novel and movie \"The Devil Wears Prada.\"\n\nEarly Life\nAnna Wintour was born November 3, 1949 in Hampstead, London. Her career began in the world of fashion before moving into journalism, largely at the behest of her parents. Her father Charles Wintour was the editor of the London Evening Standard for nearly two decades. Her parents were married for nearly forty years before divorcing in 1979. She has four siblings. Her older brother Gerald sadly died in a car accident when they were children. Wintour attended North London Collegiate School and started dating older, well-connected men in her teens. Wintour's father arranged her first job for her, at Bib boutique, when he was 15.\n\nEarly Career\nShe left North London Collegiate and began a training program at Harrods while taking fashion classes at a nearby school. In 1970, Wintour was hired on as an editorial assistant for the new Harper's & Queen fashion magazine. Even at this early stage of her career, Wintour divulged to coworkers that she had the desire to edit Vogue, (a desire that would grow to be fulfilled nearly 20 years later.) After many disagreements with her rival, Min Hogg, Anna quit the magazine and moved to New York with her boyfriend Jon Bradshaw.\n\nAt home in her new country, Anna started working as a junior fashion editor at Harper's Bazaar in 1975. However, she was fired after just nine months for trying to put forth daring, risque, and innovative shoots. A few months later, she got her first position at Viva as a fashion editor. However, the magazine shut down due to being unprofitable in 1978. Wintour took time off work and broke up with Bradshaw, starting a new relationship with French record producer Michel Estaban. For two years, she would divide her time between Paris and New York. Wintour returned to work in 1980 and became the fashion editor for New York. Wintour finally got her chance to work for Vogue when Alex Liberman, editorial director for Conde Nast (the publisher of Vogue) clued Anna in about a position there in 1983. Wintour got the position and immediately doubled her salary when she became the magazine's first creative director. In 1985, Wintour obtained her first editorship when she took over the UK edition of Vogue after Beatrix Miller retired. She replaced much of the staff and exerted more control over the magazine than previous editors had, which earned her the nickname Nuclear Wintour.\n\nIn 1987, Conde Nast requested Wintour take over House & Garden, whose readership was flailing and lagging behind Architectural Digest. She did indeed make sweeping changes: cancelling $2 million worth of photo spreads and articles in her first week and packing so much fashion onto the pages that it earned the nickname House & Garment. Ten months later, Anna Wintour became the editor of U.S. Vogue.\n\nVogue\nWintour again introduced sweeping changes to Vogue from her first issue forward. Many of these changes could be seen right on the cover. Wintour favored more naturalistic photography of lesser-known models outside, as opposed to the tight headshots the magazine had previously favored. Additionally, Wintour's first Vogue cover was also the first to feature a model wearing jeans, with the added bonus of wearing a bejeweled T-shirt valued at around $10,000.\n\nBy the 2000s, Wintour had solidified her grasp on Vogue's artistic direction and had become a household name. The September 2004 issue was the largest issue of a monthly magazine ever published at that time, sitting at a whopping 832 pages. Wintour oversaw the introduction of three magazine spinoffs: Teen Vogue, Vogue Living, and Men's Vogue. Teen Vogue has gone on to become an extremely popular entity, earning more advertiser revenue than either Elle Girl or Cosmo Girl.\n\n2006 saw the release of \"The Devil Wears Prada\", with a character based off of Wintour. The film transformed her image into a cultural icon versus just a public figure. Rumors began to fly in 2008 that Wintour had lost her touch and was set to retire, but she disputed that rumor on a \"60 Minutes\" profile. In 2013, Conde Nast announced Wintour would be taking the position of artistic director while still remaining at Vogue. In 2014, Wintour was named by Forbes magazine as the 39th most powerful woman in the world. That same year, the Metropolitan Museum of Art named its Costume Institute complex after Wintour, with First Lady Michelle Obama opening. In May 2017, Wintour was created a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire at a ceremony at Buckingham Palace for her contributions to fashion journalism. Under Wintour, Vogue has continued to be one of the pillars of fashion journalism.\n\nPersonal Life\nAnna was married to David Shaffer from 1984 to 1999. They have two children: Charles (b. 1985) and Katherine (b. 1987). Katherine, also known as Bee, wrote columns for The Daily Telegraph in 2006, but has said she has no desire to follow her mother into the fashion world. Wintour married business investor Shelby Bryan in 2004.\n\nWintour is involved with many charities. She serves as a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she organizes benefits that have raised over $50 million. Wintour started the CFDA Vogue Fund in order to mentor and support unknown fashion designers. Wintour has raised over $10 million for AIDS charities since 1990. She resides in Greenwich Village.",

That\u2019s because Kim Kardashian will be filling in for Kelly Ripa for an episode of Kelly and Ryan Live!. This will be Kim\u2019s first time co-hosting with Ryan but her second time on the show. She previously co-hosted Live! with Kelly Ripa back in 2012.\n\nMany viewers believe that there might be some behind-the-scenes friction between Ryan Seacrest and Kelly Ripa. That\u2019s because Ryan might not be focusing on their television show. Even though he\u2019s in New York City every weekday to tape his Live! episodes with Kelly, he\u2019s also hosting his radio show in Los Angeles. If that weren\u2019t enough, Ryan will also be forced to travel to Orlando every week to hot the new reboot of American Idol. With so many different projects, many fans feel that Ryan might be stretching himself too thin.\n\nSooner or later Ryan will be forced to drop one of his gigs. Of course, the last thing Kelly would want to see is him quit Live!. She already spent the last year looking for a suitable replacement for her ex co-host Michael Strahan and she doesn\u2019t want to spend another year looking for someone to take Ryan\u2019s place, too.\n\nThat\u2019s not the only problem between Ryan and Kelly right now. Many observers also believe there\u2019s also another issue that Kelly might have and that\u2019s with Kim Kardashian. With Kim, fans either absolutely love her or they hate her. There\u2019s no in between. And the last thing Kelly Ripa wants do is alienate her audience. Both Kelly and Ryan have had a hard time keeping audiences tuned in as it is.\n\nThe show\u2019s ratings are nowhere near what it used to be before. And with Kim on the show, it might go one of two ways: either fans will tune in because they\u2019ll want to see if Kim has what it takes to successfully host a show or they\u2019ll tune out altogether. After all, everyone still remembers how Kim\u2019s mother Kris Jenner tried to host her own daytime talk show herself. Her show, Kris, was canceled back in 2013 after one short month on the air.\n\nSo far Ryan Seacrest nor Kelly Ripa have made any comments about Kim Kardashian temporarily joining the show. In the meantime, don\u2019t forget to check back with CDL for all the latest news and updates on Kelly Ripa, Ryan Seacrest and all of your favorite celebrities right here.\n\nPhoto by Rich Fury/Getty Images",

        "post_text": "Taylor Swift is doing a lot to promote her new album, Reputation. Aside from the singles and music videos, the singer also released behind-the-scenes videos, branded UPS delivery trucks, and invited fans over for private listening parties. Next in the line-up is her special Reputation magazines, which Target will release on Friday, the same day as her album.\n\nSwift's been teasing her personalized publications on social media since she announced her upcoming record. They include handwritten lyrics, personal polaroids, and paintings by the singer.\n\nHowever, some fans noticed a few details in the magazines that have less to do with Swift's creative process. She shared the back covers of the publications today, revealing they're designed to look like celebrity tabloid magazine covers.\n\nFans noticed the headlines parody real tabloid stories about the star. The one titled \"Who Is Olivia's Real Father?\" is a playful reference to her cat but also appears to mock one OK! story that reported she was pregnant with the headline, \"Who's The Dad?\" Her second cover, with the headline, \"Why She Disappeared,\" seems to mimic an Us Weekly issue with the same title.\n\nAs Buzzfeed points out, Swift even got the logos down. Her \"TS Swiftly\" emblem looks like Us Weekly's, while her \"TS!!\" one resembles OK!'s.\n\nThe cover art for Swift's new album, filled with faux headlines and newspaper clippings, also references the theme of clapping back at critics and other real-life celebrity frenemies. While some praise the singer for \"taking back the narrative,\" others disapprove of her attack on the media, which one Cosmo article notes is reflective of Trump's relationship with the press.\n\nSwifties, however, have firmly aligned themselves with the former camp.\n\nReputation debuts this Friday, November 10. Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more. She was previously an editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com. There is a 75 percent chance she's listening to Lorde right now.",

Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes were first spotted dancing together in the Hamptons in 2013 \u2014 just one year after she split from Tom Cruise. Although Jamie and Katie have never confirmed their romance, they have been spotted on date nights and canoodling plenty of times over the past several years. But recently, tension has been high between them as Jamie is getting a bit jealous of Katie\u2019s friendship with former flame Joshua Jackson.\n\nThe 50-year-old Sleepless star was overheard venting about his tumultuous relationship with Katie while hanging out at Coachella. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem to care who heard him,\u201d the source exclusively told In Touch. Jamie admitted that not only was Katie talking to Joshua again, but he was also \u201churt\u201d by it.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Katie and Joshua go way back, which is why Jamie probably \u201cseemed pretty cut up by everything.\u201d The former Dawson\u2019s Creek co-stars dated in the \u201990s and Katie admitted during an interview with Rolling Stone in 1998 that Joshua was her first love.\n\nWhen asked about their relationship, a then 19-year-old Katie said, \u201cI\u2019m just going to say that I met somebody last year, I fell in love, I had my first love, and it was something so incredible and indescribable.\u201d She added, \u201cI feel so fortunate because he\u2019s now one of my best friends. It\u2019s weird, it\u2019s almost like a Dawson-and-Joey type thing now.\u201d\n\nThe pair broke things off before Katie went on to date Chris Klein for five years before marrying Tom in 2006. However, Katie and Joshua have always kept in touch despite other relationships. Surprisingly, she reached out to Joshua following her split from Tom in 2012.\n\n\u201cLike any old friend, it was like, \u2018Oh, hi, how are ya? What\u2019s going on?\u2019; \u2018I had a kid,'\u201d Joshua told a Canadian talk show host about the phone call with Katie. \u201cIt was very nice, actually.\u201d\n\nSo, does Jamie have a reason to be worried? That\u2019s a tricky question, but Jamie isn\u2019t as innocent as he seems \u2014 because he\u2019s been texting his ex, too! At the beginning of March, sources exclusively told In Touch that Katie is starting to suspect that Jamie and his baby mama Kristin Grannis are more than just friends. \u201cShe recently found out about a string of texts Jamie sent to Kristin that included details of secret meetings \u2014 and him admitting he still loved her,\u201d the insider said. And Jamie\u2019s latest act of betrayal is him showing \u201ca blatant lack of respect.\u201d\n\nTags:\nCelebrity NewsJamie FoxxJoshua JacksonKatie Holmes",

They just welcomed their little bundle of joy into the world last week and have shared the amazing news with the world. Both Cheryl and Liam couldn't stop gushing about this new little human in their lives and they are super proud to call themselves parents. However, the former X-Factor judge did reveal that their son doesn't have a moniker yet.\nSome reports are stating that Liam and Cheryl could be disagreeing on a name which is why one hasn't been picked out yet. Of course, this is all speculation and no one really knows why the baby doesn't have a name yet except the close family.\nBut, we did some digging and actually found old interviews where Liam and Cheryl talk about what they would name their future child. These interviews were done separately and before they even started dating. But, they each had completely different ideas when it came to the name.\nCould this be a clue as to what's going on with the naming today? While there's no clear answer, it's interesting to think about.\nCheryl told GQ magazine, \"I love kids, I'm obsessed with babies. I know that's what I was put on the earth to do \u2013 to be a mother\u2026Of course I've thought about baby names a million times. I like Alfie for a little boy.\"\nHowever, Liam told Hits Radio, \"I like the name Taylor. Taylor's pretty neutral for a boy or a girl. That's what I'm going to call my first child if I had children.\"\nHmmm\u2026there's no telling when or if they will reveal the baby name when they have decided but we have a feeling they will come to an agreement. And we're so excited when they do. However, multiple outlets are reporting that this photo could be the last fans see of the child. Apparently, Liam and Cheryl turned down lots of offers to publicly debut their baby and have vowed to keep his privacy and protect him from the public eye.\nWhile this seems like something they would do, we're hoping they share bits and pieces of the baby. To be honest, we can't go through life wondering if he looks more like Liam or more like Cheryl! One thing is for sure, he's healthy and that's all that really matters.

        "post_text": "Blake Shelton Calls Meeting Gwen Stefani 'a Miracle' After 'Hitting Rock Bottom'\n\nBy (102209)\u200d Published: 11:11 AM PDT, June 21, 2018\n\nShelton offers up some insight into the start of his relationship with Stefani after his divorce from Miranda Lambert.\n\nBlake Shelton is opening up about his relationship with Gwen Stefani. The country star appears on Sunday's upcoming episode of Sunday TODAY With Willie Geist and gives insight into the start of his relationship with the pop princess. \"When I was going through my divorce and just hit rock bottom, just like anyone does when they go through something that devastating, it's a miracle that I met somebody that was going through the same exact thing that I was at the exact same moment in time,\" Shelton, 42, says.\n\nBoth Shelton and Stefani, 48, divorced their partners \u2014 Miranda Lambert and Gavin Rossdale respectively \u2014 in 2015, before confirming their relationship in November of that year. For that reason, many people, Shelton and Stefani included, assumed they would have a quick rebound relationship. \"I think if Gwen and I were being honest right now talking about this, I think in the back of our minds we both kind of thought this is a rebound deal,\" Shelton reveals. \"I mean, because we're both coming out of a pretty low spot in our lives and we're kind of clinging to each other to get through this.\"\n\nThe couple is still going strong, though. \"Now here we are, going on three years later, and every day that goes by it just feels like a stronger bond between the two of us and it constantly feels like it's going to the next level,\" Shelton says. \"That's the only way I think either one of us could describe it if she was sitting right here.\" The musicians have been especially sweet the last couple of weeks. Stefani celebrated Shelton's birthday over the weekend with dinner at BOA Steakhouse in West Hollywood, California, and a cookout on Father's Day. On Tuesday, Stefani shared snaps from her time with Shelton in his home state of Oklahoma. The couple, along with Stefani's sons \u2014 Kingston, 12, Zuma, 9, and Apollo, 4 \u2014 spent time on a boat and out in nature.\n\nDespite their obvious love for each other, the duo is in no rush to tie the knot. \"There is no reason for them to rush into a marriage, so they aren\u2019t,\" a source exclusively told ET back in March. \"Both of them are happy and content with where their relationship is right now.\" The source continued: \"They are on cloud nine for each other. They are perfect for each other. They know they have found their true soulmate.\"\n\nIn April, however, the country superstar admitted to thinking about marrying his longtime love. \"I think about [marrying her]. I don't think it's anytime soon or anything,\" he said during an interview with CMT. \"The more time that goes by, I guess, the closer you'd be getting to that.\"\n\nFor more on the couple, watch below:\nVideo\nBlake Shelton Admits He Thinks About Marrying Gwen Stefani, But It Won't Happen Soon\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\nNews\nGwen Stefani Thanks Blake Shelton For 'Sharing His World' With Her -- See the Pic!\nNews\nGwen Stefani Serenades Blake Shelton for His 42nd Birthday\nNews\nGwen Stefani Attends Wedding with Blake Shelton, Dances to 'Hollaback Girl' at Reception: Watch!",

Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes were first spotted dancing together in the Hamptons in 2013 \u2014 just one year after she split from Tom Cruise. Although Jamie and Katie have never confirmed their romance, they have been spotted on date nights and canoodling plenty of times over the past several years. But recently, tension has been high between them as Jamie is getting a bit jealous of Katie\u2019s friendship with former flame Joshua Jackson.\n\nThe 50-year-old Sleepless star was overheard venting about his tumultuous relationship with Katie while hanging out at Coachella. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem to care who heard him,\u201d the source exclusively told In Touch. Jamie admitted that not only was Katie talking to Joshua again, but he was also \u201churt\u201d by it.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Katie and Joshua go way back, which is why Jamie probably \u201cseemed pretty cut up by everything.\u201d The former Dawson\u2019s Creek co-stars dated in the \u201990s and Katie admitted during an interview with Rolling Stone in 1998 that Joshua was her first love.\n\nWhen asked about their relationship, a then 19-year-old Katie said, \u201cI\u2019m just going to say that I met somebody last year, I fell in love, I had my first love, and it was something so incredible and indescribable.\u201d She added, \u201cI feel so fortunate because he\u2019s now one of my best friends. It\u2019s weird, it\u2019s almost like a Dawson-and-Joey type thing now.\u201d\n\nThe pair broke things off before Katie went on to date Chris Klein for five years before marrying Tom in 2006. However, Katie and Joshua have always kept in touch despite other relationships. Surprisingly, she reached out to Joshua following her split from Tom in 2012.\n\n\u201cSo, does Jamie have a reason to be worried? That\u2019s a tricky question, but Jamie isn\u2019t as innocent as he seems \u2014 because he\u2019s been texting his ex, too! At the beginning of March, sources exclusively told In Touch that Katie is starting to suspect that Jamie and his baby mama Kristin Grannis are more than just friends. \u201cShe recently found out about a string of texts Jamie sent to Kristin that included details of secret meetings \u2014 and him admitting he still loved her,\u201d the insider said. And Jamie\u2019s latest act of betrayal is him showing \u201ca blatant lack of respect.\u201d",

Though it should be noted that the majority of Eric's net worth is attributable to his wife Jessica Simpson, whom he marred in 2014. Born Eric Maxwell Johnson on September 15, 1979, in Needham, Massachusetts, US, he played as a tight end in the National Football League. Athletically gifted Johnson first got the chance to flaunt his football skills on a wider scale at Yale, where he played as a wide receiver. He was the one to catch 21 receptions for 244 yards in Yale's come-from-behind victory against Harvard in 1999, including the game-winning touchdown catch. He turned pro after he was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the seventh round of the 2001 NFL Draft.\n\nWhen healthy, he was a big contributor to the 49ers passing game. But still, he did miss all of the 2003 and 2005 seasons, due to injuries. He remained with the San Francisco 49ers until 2006, and he signed a one-year contract with the New Orleans Saints in 2007. The following year he got re-signed by the team, but the Saints released him for good on July 31, 2008. Two years after his retirement from the sport, the once-married former NFL player started dating singer Jessica Simpson. The couple announced their engagement few months later and they have now three children together.\n\nAll net worths are calculated using data drawn from public sources.

Well, if you\u2019re Beyonce, 36, and JAY-Z, 48, it\u2019s a custom-made, diamond Lorraine Schwartz bracelet, worth a whooping $21,000, according to The Sun. That\u2019s right, Kim Kardashian, 37, and Kanye West\u2018s third baby \u2014 who arrived on January 15 \u2014 is about to be the most decked out infant, well\u2026 ever. And, get this \u2014 Bey and JAY reportedly had the bracelet engraved with the number \u201c3,\u201d to signify Kimye\u2019s third offspring.\n\u201cBeyonce and Jay could not be more pleased for them, they can\u2019t wait to meet the little one, and have sent them this gift already,\u201d a source told the outlet. \u201cIt shows they have all moved on from the past, and they are \u2018familia\u2019 once more.\u201d Although all parties involved are reportedly thrilled about burying the hatchet, \u201cKanye is over the moon as he has always considered JAY Z his \u2018big brother,\u2019 and Beyonce has always been one of his closest friends.\u201d Ironically, both power couples have three children each, and \u201cit\u2019s only a matter of time before the playdates begin,\u201d the source added. Bey and JAY are parents to twins Sir and Rumi, who they welcomed in June 2016, and Blue Ivy, 6. Kim and Kanye are parents their daughter, North, 4, and son, Saint, 1, along with their new baby girl.\nWhile this report indicates that JAY-Z and Kanye\u2019s feud is over, JAY already hinted that he wanted to bury the hatchet during an interview with The New York Times back in November 2017. \u201cBut, that happens,\u201d JAY admitted about there being tension with Ye\u2019. JAY explained: \u201cIn the long relationship, you know, hopefully when we\u2019re 89 we look at this six months or whatever time and we laugh at that. You know what I\u2019m saying? There\u2019s gonna be complications in the relationship that we have to get through. And the only way to get through that is we sit down and have a dialogue and say, \u2018These are the things that I\u2019m uncomfortable with. These are the things that are unacceptable to me. This is what I feel.\u2019 I\u2019m sure he feels that I\u2019ve done things to him as well. You know what I\u2019m saying? These are \u2014 I\u2019m not a perfect human being by no stretch. You know.\u201d JAY also said that he had recently spoken with Ye\u2019 [at the time] and that they would always be good with each other. \u201cI love Kanye. I do,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated relationship with us.\u201d\nAs you may know, JAY and Ye\u2019s friendship took a hit back in 2016. In October of that year, Kanye went on a rant during one of his concerts where he slammed both JAY and Beyonce. He claimed their kids didn\u2019t play together, and he revealed that there was tension between him and JAY because of a TIDAL music dispute. Ye\u2019 even said that JAY and Beyonce didn\u2019t even call after Kim\u2019s 2016 Paris robbery. Just days after his rant, Kanye checked into UCLA Medical Center for an 8-9-day stay for an alleged mental breakdown.\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Bey, JAY, Kim and Ye are all friends again?",

        "post_text": "Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance Lifetime Movie Fact Check & Recap\n\nWith less than a week until Prince Harry weds Meghan Markle, Lifetime adapted the couple's love story into a film aptly titled Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance. Airing last night, the movie depicted the relationship timeline of Harry and Meghan\u2014from the factual public moments and milestones to the probably less accurate (and more dramatic) behind-the-scenes love story. While the movie did include real life events from Meghan and Harry's relationship (including their first blind date and whisking away to Botswana), there were also some...ahem...harder-to-believe plot-lines thrown in as well. Though the film's stars, Parisa Fitz-Henley [Meghan] and Murray Fraser [Harry], resembled their real-life counterparts pretty well, there were several scenes that you can bet almost certainly didn't occur\u2014no matter how accurate the cast's resemblance was. Below, we're breaking down the dramatic, very Lifetime-y moments of the movie that probably, absolutely, most definitely did not happen in real life.\n\n1) Harry and Meghan almost got attacked by a lion in Africa. On a trip to Botswana around the 20th anniversary of Princess Diana's death, the couple is dramatically confronted by an angry lion when they run outside in the middle of the night after a fight. The near-death experience, of course, causes them to make up immediately. Honestly, I can't believe this whole scene isn't already a Taylor Swift song.\n\n2) Meghan tried to break up with Harry via FaceTime, only to have him surprise her on set of Suits at the SAME exact moment. Okay, first of all, you honestly can't expect me to believe that this woman tried to break up with AN ACTUAL PRINCE via FaceTime. That's just not how this game works. On top of that, the moment she decides to end things with him is the same moment he's knocking on the door of her Suits trailer for a surprise visit to Toronto? I'm going to need the receipts on this one.\n\n3) Meghan breaks up with Harry A SECOND TIME before dramatically running to stop his plane from taking off when she comes to her senses. IT'S ALL TEW MUCH. NOBODY BREAKS UP WITH A PRINCE THIS MANY TIMES. Spoiler alert: she of course gets to his plane on time and is somehow miraculously able to stop the private royal jet from taking off. All that was missing from this scene was a thunderstorm moment filmed in the pouring rain.\n\n4) The couple dressed up as a frog and Hillary Clinton for a Halloween party...While the two were secretly dating, Harry dressed up in a frog suit (get it, the frog becomes Prince Charming?) to go \"in disguise\" at a Halloween party. Meghan, meanwhile, dressed as Hillary Clinton (because all feminists must be HRC for Halloween), making for the most awkward couples costume of all time. While it's unclear if the Soho House party in question actually occurred, I'm giving Harry and Meghan the benefit of the doubt that they would choose better costumes if said party did go down.\n\n5) Kate Middleton's intense criticism and attitude toward Meghan Markle. For whatever reason, Lifetime decided to portray the Duchess of Cambridge as a super snooty and cold character with plenty of criticism to dish out for Meghan. When William first tells Kate that Harry's dating an American girl (he actually reveals this by saying Harry \"Botswana-ed\" Meghan, a term that I'm willing to bet is not in William's vocabulary), Kate's response is, \"Oh no, they're so loud.\" While I'd be willing to overlook that slightly shady dig, later in the movie Kate tells Harry, \"If she\u2019s your girl, she can\u2019t have opinions\" before adding, \"She\u2019s divorced, she\u2019s American, she\u2019s half-black\u2026.are you ready for this? Think of what we went through because I was a commoner.\"\n\nUm, I'm calling BS\u2014I find it VERY hard to believe this was an exchange that ever took place. In fact, Kate and Meghan are reportedly pretty close now and have appeared at public events together alongside Prince William and Prince Harry. I'm sensing there was never any bad blood here...",

Top Crisis Managers Weigh In\n\u201cIf she were my client, I\u2019d tell her to shut the f\u2014 up,\u201d one Hollywood publicist tells TheWrap\nItay Hod\nJune 2, 2017 @ 5:15 PM\nShare on Social Media\nThe backlash surrounding comedian Kathy Griffin\u2019s reviled photo shoot depicting her holding the severed head of President Trump hasn\u2019t let down since it first exploded earlier this week.\nIn just the last few days she\u2019s been dumped by CNN, Squatty Potty and several venues across the country. Even friend and \u201cNew Year\u2019s Eve Live\u201d sidekick Anderson Cooper was quick to distance himself from his former co-host, calling her photo \u201cdisgusting.\u201d Now many are asking whether the comedian can survive her self-inflicted wound \u2014 one that\u2019s increasingly threatening to derail her career. \n\u201cBeing dropped by CNN definitely hurts her visibility,\u201d Matt Hiltzik, a New York-based communications consultant whose clients have included Harvey Weinstein, Alec Baldwin and Justin Bieber, told TheWrap. \u201cHer business will be fine. But her opportunities to grow beyond her core base will be limited.\u201d \nAfter widespread condemnation over her graphic photo, Griffin apologized on Tuesday, begging for forgiveness and acknowledging she \u201cwent too far.\u201d But on Friday, she held an impromptu press conference with attorney Lisa Bloom, telling reporters she\u2019s been bullied by Trump\u2019s family while vowing to mock the president even more in the future.\nBut if the intent was to quash the flurry of negative headlines that have dominated the news cycle in recent days, it may have missed the mark.\n\u201cKathy Griffin claims \u2018conspiracy\u2019 at mad, looping press conference,\u201d proclaimed Salon. Jezebel called it a \u201cpoorly conceived mess.\u201d \n\u201cI understand when you\u2019re in this situation there\u2019s a natural urge to respond,\u201d public relations expert Howard Bragman told TheWrap, however, \u201cthat has to be done with great caution and consideration.\u201d\nAnother top Hollywood publicist, who asked not to be named, said the news conference only made things worse.\n\u201cIf she were my client, I\u2019d tell her to shut the f\u2014 up,\u201d the P.R. guru told TheWrap. \u201cYou\u2019re not talking to anyone and you\u2019re certainly not talking to Lisa Bloom anymore.\u201d\nAccording to the publicist, who said he likes Griffin, her approach was ill-conceived because it lacked any perceivable strategy. \n\u201cWhat is she trying to accomplish?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs she trying to sue Trump? Good luck with that. Is she trying to say she\u2019s the victim? I think 99 percent of the people would disagree with that. She did this to herself.\u201d\n\u201cIt certainly keeps her in the news,\u201d he added.\nAll three publicists said Griffin will likely retain her core fans who have supported her for years and who are mostly anti-Trump liberals.\n\u201cShe\u2019ll have to lay low for a while and then come back and address the elephant in the room, maybe make fun of herself,\u201d the P.R. expert went on to say. \u201cThe gays are not going to leave her. This will go away if she just shuts up. There is a real crisis in this country right now and anything she says is just a distraction.\u201d\nThe good news for Griffin is that she can recover \u2026 but it might take a while for the whole thing to blow over.\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to have to recalibrate and reconsider,\u201d Bragman said. \u201cBut in no way is this going to end her career. She\u2019s funny, she\u2019s immensely talented. She\u2019s original.\u201d",

Tess [also] realised she still had feelings for her ex after splitting from him to date Harry and has apologised to him for her romance with the singer.\"\n\n\"It will take a while for Tess to build back his trust but they have been getting on as normal. She was in London this week and met her ex straight away \u2014 they\u2019ve been inseparable since.\"\n\nThe poor little lamb. Still, there's probably a jazzy shirt or a metallic pair of boots around that'll cheer him up, right?\n\nThe pair were first linked last month, when an insider revealed to The Sun that Harry and Tess were introduced my mutual friends, and he quickly became \"besotted\" with her. \"As soon as Harry met Tess there was an instant spark between them\", they explained. \"They really bonded over their mutual love of quirky fashion and food \u2013 and things turned romantic quickly.\"\n\n\"They've been on a number of dates while Harry has been in London and he's already introduced Tess to some of his close friends including his personal stylist Lou Teasdale.\"\n\n\"This really seems different to Harry's past relationships as Harry genuinely is besotted with Tess and doesn't want to risk messing this one up.\"\n\nPoor Harry. If he wants to watch Bridget Jones and eat Ben & Jerry's, he knows where we are.",

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n\nWhen members of the royal family tie the knot, there\u2019s a lot at stake\u2014including a whole lot of money. Which is why it might be surprising to some onlookers that, according to the Daily Mail, Prince Harry has declined to seek a prenuptial agreement before he marries Meghan Markle today in Windsor. But we spoke to two royal experts who said nobody should be shocked at this news. When it comes to the royals, prenups are simply not done.\n\nThis is not a celebrity marriage, it\u2019s a royal marriage.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think members of the royal family sign prenuptial agreements,\u201d says Katie Nicholl, author of Harry: Life, Loss, and Love. \u201cIt\u2019s commonplace with celebrity marriage, but this is not a celebrity marriage, it\u2019s a royal marriage.\u201d Nicholl says that Prince William and Kate Middleton also did not sign a prenuptial agreement, despite the very public divorce between William and Harry\u2019s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana. And even though three of the Queen\u2019s four children have divorced, none apparently had a prenuptial agreement.\n\nYes, there is a large sum of money in the balance for this marriage, but the true, staggering wealth belongs to the Queen, so it wouldn\u2019t be divided up if Meghan and Harry did end up divorcing. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t need a prenuptial agreement to stop Windsor Castle from being cut in half in the event they divorce, because it\u2019s not Harry\u2019s,\u201d says Duncan Larcombe, author of Prince Harry: The Inside Story.\n\nLarcombe notes that Harry does have substantial wealth on his own, thanks to his inheritance from Princess Diana, but the Queen holds the vast majority of the royal property and fortune. The Queen's net worth has been estimated at around $500 million, while Prince Harry's is estimated anywhere from $25 to $40 million. Meghan also has her own money as a successful actress on Suits, reportedly making around $50,000 per episode of the long-running series. If Meghan and Harry do ever divorce, Larcombe adds, the vast majority of negotiations would happen outside of court. For example, Diana received a new title, a financial settlement, and was entitled to royal security protection, although she turned that down. Plus, the Daily Mail notes that even though prenups are taken into account in U.K. divorces, they\u2019re not legally enforceable.\n\nAnd though royal divorces may have had a violent start, thanks to Henry VIII\u2019s habit for decapitation, royal splits try to make as few waves as possible in modern times. \u201cIn the modern history of the royal family, the divorce is described as amicable for PR reasons,\u201d Larcombe says, \u201cand the person who is departing the royal family, they\u2019re just looked after, and those arrangements are not done through court, they\u2019re done behind closed doors.\u201d",

He put everything on the line to convince them it could still work.\u201d\n\nBut, he couldn\u2019t deliver and now his wives are turning on him. They\u2019ve been struggling for the past few years, and Kody\u2019s three \u201cspiritual marriages\u201d have all fizzled out. \u201cHis only real connection seems to be with [legal wife] Robyn now,\u201d an insider revealed to Life & Style. \u201cThe other wives have all but given up on him. They mostly see him as an ex-husband who turns up to help with the children.\u201d \n\nBut, Kody doesn\u2019t want to accept that it\u2019s all coming to an end. \u201cHe\u2019s been blaming everyone for the current state of the show \u2014 except himself,\u201d the insider admitted. \u201cHe\u2019s too proud for that.\u201d When the show began in 2010, viewers were fascinated to see a seemingly happy polygamous family on TV. But those days are over. \u201cTLC has discovered you can only pretend things are all rosy for so long. Fans now realize the Browns are anything but a happy group.\u201d\n\nMeri has pulled away completely. She first shattered the illusion that all was well when she had an emotional online and phone affair in 2015 with a man, Sam Cooper, who turned out to be a female catfisher. \u201cKody has never forgiven Meri for it,\u201d the insider said. She moved out of their Las Vegas culdesac months ago after purchasing a Utah bed-and-breakfast in late 2017 and rarely returns to Vegas except for family events or when TLC needs to film something with her there. \u201cKody\u2019s happy with that arrangement. He doesn\u2019t want to have too much to do with her. Their relationship is dead.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want his reality-TV career to die too, but it\u2019s out of his hands. TLC is planning to create a series focusing on the children of sister wives, the insider says, which will feature Meri and Kody\u2019s daughter, Mariah, who came out as a lesbian last year. \u201cShe\u2019s a favorite with fans because of her maturity,\u201d the insider added. \u201cBut while Meri will make the occasional appearance on the show, there are no plans to feature Kody. For him, things are very much over.\u201d\n\nHave a tip? Send it to us! Email In Touch at contact@intouchweekly.com.",

The duo filed to end their 10-year marriage on April 13, 2016, nearly two years after they originally announced their split. The divorce isn\u2019t yet finalized but is progressing, sources have said, as the two have been in mediation with leading L.A. divorce lawyer Laura Wasser to settle privately.\n\nSince then, they have continued to happily co-parent their three children, Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6, and spent Easter weekend together with them in Hawaii, where Affleck has been shooting his new movie Triple Frontier.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing well, and are both committed to providing a supportive environment for their kids,\u201d a source close to Affleck tells PEOPLE. \u201cThey continue to remain cordial to one another. There is a lot of love and respect there.\u201d\n\nThe day before the holiday, the whole family made a group trip to Sea Life Park in Oahu. \u201cThey made a family trip to interact with dolphins, sea lions and stingrays,\u201d a source told PEOPLE. \u201cThey spent several hours at the park and looked like they had the best time. The kids were all very interested in learning about the animals. They all seem like huge dolphin fans.\u201d\n\nDuring the trip, Garner stayed at a resort while Affleck stayed at a nearby house. \u201cJen seemed excited about the trip. She hasn\u2019t been to Hawaii for a while and always loved it,\u201d added the source.\n\n\u201cThe kids love when they all spend time together,\u201d said a second source.\n\nWhen filming breaks allow, the actor, 45, visits the kids at home in Los Angeles. \u201cHe\u2019s found a really good routine,\u201d an insider said. \u201cHe\u2019s in a great place, enjoying his work on the new film and being able to fly back to spend time with the family during downtime.\u201d\n\nDays before Garner and the children arrived in Hawaii, Affleck\u2019s girlfriend, Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus, 37, also visited him.\n\nSources have said the two are in a committed relationship but taking it slow.\n\n\u201cBen is in a very committed relationship with Lindsey Shook us and they too work hard to balance time between work, friends and their families,\u201d says the source close to Affleck.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Garner was spotted out in N.Y.C. looking relaxed and happy. The actress, 45, was smiling ear to ear as she attended an event at the famous French bakery Ladur\u00e9e.\n\nGarner remains supportive as the Justice League star, who\u2019s continuing his treatment for alcohol addiction, moves on. \u201cAs long as Ben keeps working on himself, Jen is happy,\u201d another insider said. \u201cShe will continue to support him because it benefits the kids.\u201d\n\nThe actor is looking to buy a home, listed for $19.2 million, near Garner in Los Angeles. Affleck has his eye on the space that boasts seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms along with a screening room, gym, family room and maid\u2019s room as well as a backyard with pool, spa, outdoor BBQ and guest house.\n\nThis comes months after the father of three was first spotted house hunting with Shookus.\n\n\u201cBen is looking to buy a family friendly house,\u201d a source previously told PEOPLE in October 2017. \u201cLindsay shared her opinions, but it was clear that they are not buying a house together.\u201d\n\nAffleck had been living in a rental since he moved out of the family estate he used to share with Garner. Prior to their divorce filing last April, he was living in the family\u2019s guesthouse.",

When I was sick with breast cancer, he was the first to call. He helps and helped in ways that \u2026 you know, he was incredible in that way.\u201d\n\nThough Kotb has fond memories of Lauer, 60, she isn\u2019t discounting the stories of the women who came forward and accused the previous NBC anchor of sexual misconduct.\n\u201cThere is that Matt and then there\u2019s the Matt that the accusers speak of. And those accusers\u2019 voices matter and that story matters and it\u2019s \u2026 (to Savannah Guthrie) It\u2019s still tough, right?\u201d Kotb said in the THR interview to Guthrie, who affirmed: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been five months since Lauer parted ways with the show at the end of November after the network received a \u201cdetailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,\u201d with reason to believe \u201cthis may not have been an isolated incident.\u201d Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.\n\nFollowing his firing, which was announced live on Today by Guthrie and Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.\n\u201cThere are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,\u201d he said, in part. \u201cTo the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with PEOPLE following Lauer\u2019s exit, Guthrie, 46, and Kotb opened up about sharing the sobering news with the world.\n\u201cI think you could see from the moment that the news happened that our hearts were broken, and in lots of ways, they still are,\u201d Guthrie said. \u201cThat feeling was shared through our whole newsroom and our whole Today show staff, because it sounds like clich\u00e9 or a promo line, but it happens to be true: We are family, and we do love each other, and families do go through hard times, and when that happens in good families, you just get closer. You pull together and you focus on the foundation and what keeps you together. I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve all been trying to do. And for me, I just am trying to get comfortable with how complicated the feelings around all of it are, and it is complicated. And just trying to have love and compassion for everyone concerned.\u201d\n\nThe duo also spoke about Lauer, whom they are continuing to support and only want the best for.\n\u201cWe know he\u2019s working on his family, we know that for sure. Of course our hearts go out to the brave women who have told their stories,\u201d Guthrie said.\n\n\u201cWhat we are experiencing and processing now is how to honor and remain a true friend to someone even in spite of learning things that are deeply disturbing,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd we are trying to navigate that path with integrity.\u201d",

A source close to Bieber told the outlet that despite all the Baskin Champion romance talk, Justin Bieber just wants to have Gomez back with him\u2014at church, the ice rink, and beyond. \u201cHe loves her. He wants her back,\u201d the source said, adding that Bieber \u201cmisses\u201d Gomez.\n\nBieber and Gomez's last big public date was his father's wedding in Jamaica, where they recreated their 2011 wedding kiss. They spent 6 out of 7 consecutive days together that week, indicating they were stronger than ever and might make their on-off relationship permanently on this time, according to the tabloids. But Gomez's family never approved of the Biebs, a major factor that led to their break, some outlets reported. And Bieber, according to Us Weekly's source, started acting selfish again, annoying Gomez. \u201c[He] doesn\u2019t care about anyone but himself,\" the source told Us on March 12. \"The second she saw it, she walked away, especially now with her health. She knows she doesn\u2019t need him.\u201d\n\nThe break seemed to be instigated by Gomez right around Bieber's March 1 birthday. Bieber never wanted this: \"Justin has been upset about the recent break from Selena and is trying to keep busy until they work things out,\" a source told E! on March 21. \"It wasn't his choice for them to split, and he is really taking time to focus on himself right now.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Gomez had a realization, E! reported on March 26: that he may be better, but they may still not be right... at least right now. \"Selena realized even though he's made some positive improvements, they just aren't a perfect match right now,\" a source told the outlet.\n\nBut Gomez's birthday post to Bieber remains on her Instagram, a sign that hope may not be lost yet.\n\nGomez was most recently photographed with her friends yesterday, posing in pink pajamas and Puma merch. She was also filmed lipsyncing in the car by her assistant Theresa Mingus.\n\nBieber attended Holy Wednesday church service with Baskin Champion but has not been photographed with her since. His last appearance was on his social media on Easter, when he posted four bunny selfies.\n\nAlyssa Bailey\nSenior News and Strategy Editor\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

That\u2019s not due to any actual action on his own part; it\u2019s wading through all of the rumors. One of those rumors was centered around his relationship with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Neri Oxman, which began in April. As it turns out, though, Pitt is allegedly still single and relishing that fact.\n\n\u201cHe has gone on dates but he\u2019s not looking to leap into a serious relationship at the moment,\u201d a source close to Pitt told Entertainment Tonight. \u201cHe is content on his own and enjoys the quality time he spends with the children when he isn\u2019t working.\u201d\n\nInstead of spending time on his love life, Pitt has apparently been putting all of his energy into parenting the six children he shares with Jolie, as well as his career, which includes a starring role in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. \u201cHe is focused on two of the most important things he should be focused on, and those are his children and his work,\u201d the source said, adding that Pitt is \u201cin a great place personally and professionally\u2026. Being a father is his number one job, and he knows that. He will always be there for those children\u2026. He\u2019s spending more time out and about socializing with his close friends, but he also is still a homebody and appreciates hanging around his place.\u201d\n\nPitt confirmed the latter in his latest revealing interview, with GQ, in which he talked about dealing with his loneliness. \u201cYou have to wrap your stuff up at night and bring order back to your chaos for the next day,\u201d he said. \u201cI find it a great opportunity for the introspection. Now you have to be real careful not to go too far that way and get cut off in that way. I\u2019m really good at cutting myself off, and it\u2019s been a problem. I need to be more accessible, especially to the ones I love.\u201d Now, it seems like he\u2019s taking the time to do that.",

Covering the new issue of Adweek, Kim says she knows her constant picture-taking is a bit \"ridiculous,\" but it's just her way of remembering all the amazing things in her life. Which is fair enough, really.\n\n\"So many people think that taking so many selfies is just ridiculous,\" she says. \"For me, what's so funny is I love taking pictures and posting them on social media for memories.\n\n\"I'm kind of letting them know, yes, it is ridiculous, but it's all fun. I can look at a photo on social media and see a picture and know exactly where I was by the outfit I had on or who I was with. I take it more as a fun, emotional scrapbook that I love to look back on.\"\n\nIn fact, Kim says she took her first selfie way back in 1984 when she was just five years old and, just like the rest of us, remembers the days when you had to lug an actual camera around with you.\n\nSo, why is she covering Adweek? Well, she's is actually making a pretty massive impact on the tech world. Her Kim Kardashian: Hollywood made $74 million last year and is reportedly set to bring in another $200 million this year. Not bad.\n\nThe Kardashians are currently filming the tenth series of Keeping Up With The Kardashians and Kim says there's no big secret to their success - they're just \"a normal family\".\n\n\"We are a family like everyone else's that goes through so many different things and we're always there to support each other.

She did not say where the baby was born, nor what she has been named. \"Kanye and I are happy to announce the arrival of our healthy, beautiful baby girl,\" the statement said. \"We are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care.\"\n\nShe said the couple's two other children, North, 4, and Saint, 2, are \"thrilled to welcome their baby sister.\"\n\nKardashian and West hired a surrogate because Kardashian's doctors strongly advised her not to go through a third pregnancy, as she discussed on her show, Keeping Up with the Kardashians. She suffered from placenta accreta, a painful and potentially life-threatening condition that makes childbirth difficult because the placenta is attached too deeply to the uterine wall.\n\nBut she wanted a third baby and her desire grew stronger in the wake of her traumatic experience as the victim of an armed robbery in Paris in October 2016. \"I've come to the conclusion that I can't carry another one,\" Kardashian told her mother, Kris Jenner, on the show. \"So now I want to explore surrogacy.\"\n\nKardashian's representative confirmed the birth but didn't offer any more details.",

The publication's explosive report claims Justin was spotted riding his motorbike around New York City without his wife. An insider close to the couple told the publication, 'He's the happiest man in Manhattan, while Jen chooses to stay primarily in sunny LA.' 'It's a long distance marriage,' they add. Getty Life & Style reports that the days leading up to Jen's 49th birthday on February 11 was when the couple's relationship came crumbling down. The publication claims to have exclusively learned that Jen feared Justin intended to break up with her on her big day, with a source revealing: 'He'd arranged to throw Jen a small, intimate party and hang around for a few days before heading right back to New York. 'And Jen thought he had plans to quietly file for divorce soon as he returned.' The insider continues, 'As time drags on, Justin seems to view his visits with Jen as obligatory, and he's just been going through the motions.' 'The marriage is all but over.' Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux step out looking tense in New York City Getty Life & Style's sensational report reveals that the whole situation is far too familiar for Jen. After a New Year's getaway in 2005 to Anguilla with Brad Pitt and several friends, Jen and her then husband announced their separation. In public Jen and Justin have always put on a solid front, but Life & Style's bombshell report reveals that Justin is 'tired' of the facade. 'He seems like he's tired of carrying on the facade of a happy marriage,' a friend close to the star told Life & Style. 'Knowing Justin, I think he feels it's best to make it an official split. He will always love Jen, but deep down he seems to believe they'd be better off as friends.' The couple have yet to respond to Life & Style's allegations.",

Oliver Hudson joked about his sister Kate Hudson\u2018s rumored romance with Brad Pitt on Instagram on Friday, January 20.\n\nKate Hudson and Brad Pitt Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic; Karwai Tang/WireImage\n\nThe Rules of Engagement alum, 40, shared a photo of a recent Star magazine cover, which claimed Kate, 37, and Pitt, 53, are \u201cgetting serious\u201d and have moved in together. Oliver was clearly amused by the tabloid rumors and wrote a lengthy (and sarcastic) response to shut down the speculation.\n\n\u201cYeah and it\u2019s been hell!!

And this is when he\u2019s at MY house!!! He\u2019s already calling me brother and has driven a wedge between myself and my real brother Wyatt who now won\u2019t speak to me. He insists my kids call him uncle B and lost my youngest at the Santa Monica pier for 2 days.. thank god for amber alert.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mom [Goldie Hawn]\u2019s overtly flirting with him!\u201d he continued. \u201cShe\u2019s wearing these little nighties around the house now?!

Days before Oliver\u2019s Instagram post, a paparazzo asked Hawn, 71, if she was \u201cready to have Brad as a son-in-law,\u201d causing the Snatched actress to burst out laughing, according to a video posted by The Sun. \u201cYou did make me laugh,\u201d Hawn admitted.",

And the timing could not be better \u2014 as Blake is going through his own breakup from his now-ex, Gwen Stefani.\n\n\u201cMiranda reached out to Blake via text,\u201d a source close to the former spouses tells In Touch exclusively. \u201cUltimately, they buried the hatchet and have been supporting each other through their latest troubled relationships. They\u2019ve become close friends and allies over the past month or so.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a future that no one could\u2019ve imagined for the exes, who were married for five years before calling it quits in 2015. At that time, it seemed unlikely that the two would ever reconcile, but now that the time has been able to pass, the two have become each other\u2019s closest allies \u2014 and those closest to them say even a romantic reunion isn\u2019t totally out of the question. \u201cThey have developed into close confidantes and are sharing intimate details of their lives,\u201d the source adds exclusively.\n\nIt turns out the timing for their reunion could not have been more perfect. Anderson decided to call it quits with Miranda after spending nearly three years together. Elsewhere in Hollywood, Blake decided to cool things off with Gwen after growing more and more tired of her constant \u201cdrama\u201d and their disagreements when it came to starting a family together.\n\nAnd despite both women having the plug pulled on their relationships, they couldn\u2019t be handling it more differently. While Miranda is left questioning what the future of her love life will look like, she refuses to dwell on the past. \u201cHer allegiance is to her songs, the road, and her fans right now,\u201d another insider says of Miranda. Gwen is taking the news as well as Miranda. \u201cShe continues to send [Blake] loving social media support from LA while he\u2019s been out on the road,\u201d another insider says of the mother-of-three. \u201cBut Blake has drastically slowed regular communication with her.\u201d\n\nFollowing his increased frustrations with Gwen, a source close to Blake says \u201che\u2019s \u201cjust a simple, country guy who wants his family and his woman by his side. And that woman isn\u2019t Gwen.\u201d In the meantime, we\u2019ll all remain hopeful that the woman can be Miranda \u2014 again!\n\nHave a tip? Send it to us!

However, it 'didn't take long' for her to change her mind. Find out what pushed her over the edge!\n\nBy: Kathleen Harper Reading Time: 2 minute\nMarch 1, 2018 10:06AM EST\n\nLooks like Kylie Jenner, 20, has gotten off her high horse about not wanting help with her baby daughter Stormi Webster! During her pregnancy, the makeup mogul insisted she would raise her child on her own without ANY nannies, but since the baby\u2019s birth, Kylie has found herself in over her head. As a result, she\u2019s hired a significant amount of help \u2014 cue the I-told-you-so\u2019s! But hey, at least the 20-year-old can admit when she\u2019s wrong, right? Click here to see adorable pics of baby Stormi.\n\n\u201cKylie had every intention of raising Stormi without nannies but it didn\u2019t take very long for her to admit that she needs help,\u201d a source close to Kylie shared with HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cShe went three nights in a row without really sleeping. After that she broke down and hired night nurses.\u201d Once Kylie got a taste of what that was like, she apparently couldn\u2019t resist asking for even more assistance. \u201cThat was such a big help she very quickly started hiring more staff for her and Stormi,\u201d our insider explained. \u201cHer mom is still helping her but she\u2019s got her own life, she\u2019s not giving that up.\u201d\n\nOf course Kylie\u2019s opinionated family is rubbing her nose in it a little bit, after all, she was SO convinced she could take care of Stormi all on her own. \u201cKylie had to eat a little humble pie when she agreed to hire nannies because she made such a big deal about how she wasn\u2019t going to do it,\u201d the source added. \u201cShe definitely said some things that were a little offensive to her sisters about them using nannies, they\u2019re giving her a hard time about it now.\u201d\n\nAt first, Kylie said she only wanted family members around her child, but once Stormi arrived, she realized that wasn\u2019t very realistic. With the extra set of hands, it seems Kylie and her baby daddy, Travis Scott, 25, are handling parenting well. In fact, the two are on better terms than ever now, as Travis recently gave Kylie a lavish $1.4 million push present! He gifted her with a rare Ferrari, and she\u2019s completely in love with it.\n\n\u201cIt really proves to her that Travis loves her because this gift was just so perfect for her,\u201d our insider told us. \u201cIt put the nail in the coffin for her and Tyga, that\u2019s for sure. She hasn\u2019t talked abut him once since Travis gave her this car. She\u2019s all about Travis again.\u201d",

Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner are moving forward with their divorce. The former couple has settled their divorce case, ET has learned. A judgement was filed on Aug. 9 to finalize the divorce, however, a judge has not signed off or officially approved the judgement, meaning the pair is still not yet officially divorced.\n\nAccording to TMZ, who was first to report the news, the two -- who didn't have a prenup -- have reached a property settlement and agreed to joint custody of their three kids, Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6.\n\nET has reached out to both Affleck and Garner's reps.\n\nThe news comes two weeks after ET learned that Garner and Affleck's divorce case was on the verge of being dismissed. The notice was the actress' third notice of case review from a judge, who requested that she take action immediately.\n\nGarner and Affleck announced their separation in 2015, and filed for divorce last April. Despite their split, the former pair have remained on good terms as they continue to co-parent their kids. Garner was even photographed driving Affleck to an L.A. rehab facility on Wednesday. A source previously told ET that the actress is \"relieved\" that Affleck, who has been open about his struggles with alcoholism, was \"in a safe place.\"\n\n\"This has been a rough few days and [Jennifer] wants nothing more than to feel [Ben] is getting the help that he needs,\" the source said, adding that Garner has \"been Ben's rock\" throughout this process. \"She is used to putting on a brave face, and handling Ben's addiction, but the process has been very exhausting for her. She won't give up on Ben because he is the father of her kids.\"\n\n\"Ben trusts Jen entirely and followed Jen's instructions,\" the source said of Affleck, who revealed he last completed treatment for alcohol addiction in March 2017. \"This time he sounded willing and ready on all counts. Friends who saw Ben's rapid decline are breathing a huge sigh of relief. They have high hopes for a recovery.\"",

The two have allegedly been flirting like crazy on set of their new film, although Margot is a married woman! \u2014 So, what's really going on here?\n\nWork hard, play hard! Brad Pitt, 54, and Margot Robbie, 28, have reportedly been flirting it up on the set of their forthcoming film, Once a Time in Hollywood. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that Brad\u2019s completely smitten with Margot,\u201d a source tells Life & Style magazine. Their upcoming film also stars Leonardo DiCaprio, 43, who\u2019s even reportedly noticed the close camaraderie between Brad and Margot. Leo \u201chas called him out for layering it on so thick [with Margot],\u201d the insider adds. \u2014 While this is adorable and all, nothing about this alleged relationship has been confirmed.\n\nAnd, let\u2019s not forget that Margot is a married woman. She tied the knot with her longtime boyfriend, Tom Ackerley, a film director, back in December 2016. She and Ackerley had a low key, secretive wedding on a beach in Australia\u2019s Byron Bay, according to reports, where she wore an Oscar de la Renta gown. After much speculation, Margot finally confirmed she had said, \u201cI do,\u201d with an Instagram post (on December 19, 2016) from her wedding day. The actress posted a photo of her diamond ring as she and Ackerley shared a sweet kiss outdoors.\n\nSince Brad knows all of this, he\u2019s reportedly been nothing but professional and respectful of Margot\u2019s marriage. \u201cBrad insists he knows she\u2019s off limits,\u201d the insider tells the mag, adding that Brad is \u201cjust awed by Margot\u2019s talent.\u201d And, we can\u2019t blame him about that! The source also notes that Brad, who\u2019s always been a fan of Margot\u2019s work, helped the actress land her role in The Big Short.\n\nBrad\u2019s been a single man since late 2016, after he and actress Angelina Jolie, 43, called it quits in September of that year. The two went through a nasty and very public divorce and custody battle, until they decided to have the court docs sealed for the sake of their children\u2019s privacy. After many months of their lawyers going back and forth, a recent report claimed Brad and Angie reached a temporary custody agreement in early June 2018 that would allegedly last the summer. A judge reportedly ruled that five of their six children \u2014 Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 9, must have a good relationship and spend time with both parents. Maddox, 16, their oldest child, on the other hand, is allegedly able to go with either parent of his choosing because of his older age.\n\nNow, the exes are on better terms these days and getting along as they live their new normal of co-parenting their children. While there\u2019s been reports of Brad and Angie dating other people, nothing has been confirmed.",

The news was quickly picked up by national outlets such as People.\n\nThe Blast reported that both parties recently filed court documents to extend a \"temporary judge\" oversight period on their divorce case, allowing it to remain private while Pitt and Jolie continue to discuss dividing up assets and custody of their six children. Currently, the blog reported, Jolie has custody of Maddox, Zahara, Pax, Shiloh and twins Knox and Vivienne.

I wasn't a prince; I was just Harry.\" \n\nWhen he was forced to leave his first tour of Afghanistan when his location was revealed by the press in 2008, Harry admitted that he went through a bit of a rough patch. \"I spent many years kicking my heels and I didn't want to grow up,\" he said, referring to his partying past. Once he finally got things together though, he seriously contemplated leaving the royal life behind, but his loyalty to his grandmother Queen Elizabeth helped him in his decision to stay. \"I felt I wanted out but then decided to stay in and work out a role for myself. We don't want to be just a bunch of celebrities, but instead, use our role for good.\" And he's certainly doing just that.

The Mission: Impossible 6 star also revealed that the movie's title confirming that Top Gun 2 will adopt the lead character's name in the title. The sequel will be called, Top Gun: Maverick.\nFollowing the announcement, no other official announcements regarding the movie's cast or plot were shared thereafter as the actor got involved in wrapping up MI6. With no more official word available, a report by Star claims that Cruise has approached John Travolta's wife Kelly Preston to co-star in the movie. Fans would remember that Preston was Cruise's co-star in Jerry Maguire.\n\nBizarrely, the news report associates his request to the actress who is associated with Scientology. A source allegedly claims, \"Tom thinks she's super talented, not to mention sexy\" and wants her in the movie. But Travolta is apparently opposing Cruise's offer because the former resents the fellow Scientologist.\n\"John's always been jealous of the church giving Tom top billing. Tom already gets whatever he wants, but John draws the line at his wife,\" the insider said.\nActor John Travolta and wife Kelly Preston arrive at the 87th Academy Awards in HollywoodReuters\nMeanwhile, Gossip Cop claims otherwise. The site reports that there is no tension between the two actors. The website also clarifies that Cruise hasn't even approached Preston about a role in the July 2019 release.\nWhile fans wait to watch things unfold, Justin Marks teased the plot of the sequel. The screenwriter, who has penned down the early draft of Maverick, recently told Slash, hinting towards a love angle in the movie.\n\"Without getting into details, that was something that was important to everyone to avoid, to find something new,\" Marks said. \"I think [Producer] Jerry [Bruckheimer] would kill me if I told any specific details.\"\n\nHe added, \"Here's what I can say about what I brought to it. I know I want it to be a story about Maverick where we get to see Maverick being Maverick in the way we want him to be. I feel like times have changed in 30 years but the desire for that kind of hero still remains the same. That doesn't mean he's a perfect character. That's the fun of it.\"",
