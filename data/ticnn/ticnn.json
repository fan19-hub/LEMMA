        "original_post": "Democrats were counting on a rapid burst of diversification in the U.S. fueled by immigration to help Hillary Clinton. But it may have helped put Donald Trump in the White House. The more rapidly a county has diversified since the start of this century, the more likely voters there were to cast ballots for the Republican nominee, a Wall Street Journal analysis of voting results and census data shows. It appears to be one reason Mr. Trump turned some traditional blue states into red states, including Wisconsin. The Journal identified counties that had seen the most rapid demographic change since 2000 using the diversity index, a tool used by social scientists and economists. It measures the chance that any two people in a county will have a different race or ethnicity. The analysis concluded that small towns in the Midwest diversified more quickly than almost any part of the U.S. between 2000 and 2015. Most was a result of Latinos moving into heavily white areas, particularly in Iowa, Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota. Although southern border states have drawn a far greater number of Mexican and other Central American immigrants during this century<U+2019>s immigration wave, their diversity changed little because they have long had racially mixed populations. The GOP nominee won about 67% of voters in counties where the diversity index rose by 150% or more, the Journal<U+2019>s analysis of the vote tally as of late<U+00A0>Wednesday found. Mrs. Clinton won about 29% of votes in those counties. Although Latinos and blacks are more likely to vote Democratic, their increased presence in the rural Midwest didn<U+2019>t translate to wins in key states, in part because newly arrived Hispanic immigrants often aren<U+2019>t eligible to vote. Exit polls showed<U+00A0>17% of Trump backers said immigration was the most important issue facing the country, ranking it third among four, with the economy topping the list. Trempealeau County, Wis., a farming and manufacturing enclave in western Wisconsin, hadn<U+2019>t voted for a Republican presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan in 1984. A rush of Latino immigrants into the town of Arcadia there for jobs packing chickens and making furniture helped transform the town from virtually all white to more than one-third Latino over roughly the past 15 years. Residents there said that helped draw voters irked about crowding in public schools to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s candidacy. He won 54% of the vote in the county, while Mrs. Clinton took 42% of it.

        "original_post": "WASHINGTON<U+2014>The economy continued to expand into early October despite some uncertainty generated by the coming presidential election, a Federal Reserve report said Wednesday, indicating more of the slow growth that could leave the central bank on track to raise interest rates late this year. The Fed<U+2019>s latest report on regional economic conditions, known as the beige book, said most districts reported modest or moderate growth amid tight labor markets and steady wage gains. The survey collected anecdotal information on economic activity from late August through early October from 12 district banks. <U+201C>Outlooks are positive, although contacts in several sectors cite the upcoming presidential election as a source of near-term uncertainty, delaying some business decisions,<U+201D> the Fed<U+2019>s Boston district said in the report. The beige book report comes two weeks before Fed officials gather for their Nov. 1-2 meeting. Most economists expect policy makers to hold off on any move until the final month of the year<U+2014>a Wall Street Journal survey of economists found 81.4% believed the Fed will raise rates at its Dec. 13-14 meeting. The central bank last increased its benchmark rate in December 2015. Since then, officials have held steady amid slow growth and an uncertain outlook. Three Fed officials voted to raise rates in September, though the majority prevailed against any move. <U+201C>There isn<U+2019>t this tremendous urgency to act on monetary policy right now,<U+201D> New York Fed President William Dudley said last week. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s not like if we wait a meeting or don<U+2019>t wait a meeting that it has huge consequences for the trajectory of the economy.<U+201D> One factor generating uncertainty: the U.S. presidential election. Americans go to the polls on Nov. 8 to decide between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton. Control of the Senate, and perhaps the House, also is at stake. The beige book report found fairly steady progress across the U.S. economy. <U+201C>Labor market conditions remained tight across most districts,<U+201D> the Fed said. <U+201C>While reports of labor shortages varied across skill levels and industries, there were multiple mentions of difficulty hiring in manufacturing, hospitality, health care, truck transportation and sales.<U+201D> Wage growth remained modest and price growth mild, the report said. Elsewhere in the economy, reports were varied, with transportation-related manufacturing a bright spot, consumer spending mixed, real estate activity expanding despite low inventories and rising prices for homes, and commercial and industrial lending increasing. The worst appears to be over for the oil and gas sector, which had been punished by a sharp drop in prices. The farm sector, meanwhile, faced mixed fortunes amid high yields but low commodity prices, the Fed said.

        "original_post": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 19000 for the first time, extending a stretch of milestones for major U.S. stock indexes. The index of 30 companies flirted with the level off and on Tuesday, trading below 18963 and rising to nearly 19044 before closing at 19023.87, up 67.18 points, or 0.4%, on the day. It has been both a long and a short road from 18000. The Dow industrials first closed above that level in December 2014, but finished below it as recently as Nov. 4, just before Donald Trump was elected president. Since then, the index has climbed 1,000-plus points in 12 trading days. The quickest advance from the first time the index crossed a 1,000-point milestone to the time it added another thousand was in 1999, when it went from 10000 to 11000 in 24 trading days. The rally since the presidential vote has, in particular, benefited the shares of industrial companies and banks, bolstering the blue-chip index. The Dow<U+2019>s surge has led to an unusual dynamic: The index is on track to post a stronger yearly performance than the S&P 500 for the first time since 2011. The Dow is up 9.2% this year, while the S&P 500 has gained 7.8%. The stampede into sectors that have lifted the Dow to new heights <U+201C>happened so quickly and so parabolically,<U+201D> said Rob Bartenstein, chief executive of Kestra Private Wealth Services. The Dow<U+2019>s late-year surge is also at odds with the index<U+2019>s performance at the start of 2016. In January, worries about slowing economic growth in China and its possible spillover effects sent the index to its worst-ever five-day start to a year. U.S. economic data have since improved, and investors have re-embraced stocks. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory also renewed demand for shares of companies tied to economic growth, particularly the manufacturing sector. Banks also are new stock-market darlings, as investors have bet on loosened regulation under Mr. Trump as well as higher interest rates. All but two of the 24 banks listed on the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index have hit a 52-week high since the Nov. 8 election. <U+201C>People are now thinking the glass is half full,<U+201D> said Jimmy Chang, chief investment strategist at asset-management and advisory firm Rockefeller & Co., referring to the stock market<U+2019>s postelection rally. Talk about tax cuts and infrastructure spending are contributing to investors<U+2019> optimism, he said. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 added 4.76 points, or 0.2%, to 2202.94, the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 17.49 points, or 0.3%, to 5386.35, and the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks rose 12.11 points, or 0.9%, to 1334.34, the second consecutive day of records for all three. For the year, the Nasdaq Composite has advanced 7.6%, while the Russell 2000 has climbed 17%. Write to Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com and Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell said on Thursday that the league was looking at a variety of ways to shorten game broadcasts, including trimming some advertising, to keep the action moving. The league has seen its television ratings plunge this season, something that Goodell has said is related to a number of factors, including the intense interest in the presidential election, as well as shifts in the way fans have been watching games. Though television ratings are down by double digits so far this season, Goodell said that N.F.L. ratings had risen 27 percent in the past decade even as ratings for prime-time television had fallen 36 percent. Speaking on Thursday at the annual DealBook conference hosted by The New York Times, he called this year<U+2019>s decline <U+201C>cyclical.<U+201D> Goodell noted, though, that the pace of games could also be a factor in the ratings decline. Fans have complained for years that games are too long, and they frequently express annoyance at the number of commercial breaks and video reviews. Last season, the average length of regular-season games, from kickoff to final whistle, was 3 hours 8 minutes, six minutes longer than in 2008. Goodell said the league was considering a number of potential solutions to improve the pace of games, including running fewer advertisements and changing when they run. The league is also looking at ways to speed up video reviews by its officials as well as the time it takes referees to announce penalties on the field. <U+201C>We want to take as much what we call dead time, non-action out of the game, so that we can make the game more exciting,<U+201D> Goodell said. The league has expanded the number of games it plays on Thursday nights and overseas, leading some to speculate that the N.F.L. may be reducing interest in the game. Goodell said he was mindful of that possibility. <U+201C>Every game counts, so that makes our inventory incredibly valuable,<U+201D> he said, adding that the league has to be careful not to saturate the market. Goodell said he was aware of a surge of complaints that officials were botching calls on the field. He said the league was looking at how best to use technology to improve officiating without slowing down the game. <U+201C>I was at Giants Stadium in the parking lot last weekend, and I got a lot of feedback from fans,<U+201D> he said. Goodell was uncertain how the election of Donald J. Trump <U+2014> who brought a lawsuit against the league three decades ago <U+2014> would affect the N.F.L. He noted that Trump favored less regulation, but he said that the primary concern for the league was its ability to reach fans through the media and technology. It was unclear what changes, if any, a Trump administration might make that would affect those industries.

Mr. McFaul served as the U.S. envoy to Moscow between 2012 and 2014, where he was a democratic adviser on Russian policy to Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state. In another tweet, Mr. McFaul said his <U+201C>close affiliation with [President Barack] Obama <U+201D> was behind the travel restriction. Russia<U+2019>s Ministry of Foreign Affairs wouldn't immediately comment on the issue.

Mr. Trump<U+2019>s democratic rival Mrs. Clinton was widely viewed with mistrust and suspicion by the Russian political leadership.

        "original_post": "TOKYO<U+2014>Japan<U+2019>s economy likely expanded modestly in the three months through September on the back of a rise in exports despite tepid spending by businesses and households. Gross domestic product likely grew an annualized 0.9% in the third quarter, according to a survey of 20 economists by The Wall Street Journal. That would mark a third straight quarter of expansion, the longest stretch of growth for Japan in three years. The data are due Monday morning in Japan. A third consecutive quarterly expansion would likely be welcome news for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in his quest to strengthen growth, though its slow pace doesn<U+2019>t point to the kind of reinvigorated economy promised by his Abenomics policy platform. The coming figures are likely to reinforce the view that years of easy monetary policy and economic stimulus have yet to convince Japanese households and businesses to spend significantly more. <U+201C>It will be positive growth, but unbalanced, largely dependent on foreign demand,<U+201D> said Dai-ichi Life Research Institute economist Yoshiki Shinke in a report. <U+201C>Japan<U+2019>s economy is still sluggish.<U+201D> Household spending<U+2014>accounting for 60% of GDP<U+2014>is expected to fall 0.1% on quarter. Economists say that households are still reluctant to spend because many workers haven<U+2019>t seen significant pay increases. Department store sales have fallen on year for the past 11 months through September, due in part to a fall in spending by foreign tourists, according to the Japan Department Stores Association. Many Japanese companies also aren<U+2019>t feeling optimistic, either, a factor that likely held back capital spending in the quarter. Economists forecast capital spending edged up only 0.1% on quarter. The overall economic expansion was likely due to a 1.9% rebound in exports on quarter, as well as a fall in imports. Combined, economists predict that net exports contributed a net 0.5 percentage point to growth. Despite the rise in exports, corporate executives remain concerned about the effects of a stronger yen on repatriated profits. Even firmness in the dollar following the surprise victory of Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election still leaves the yen far stronger than its 2015 low against the greenback around <U+00A5>125. Camera maker Canon Inc. last month cut its full-year earnings view for the third time this year as it revised its dollar assumption rate to <U+00A5>100 from <U+00A5>105. <U+201C>We decided to revise down the forecasts, considering a risk that the yen may strengthen further,<U+201D> chief financial officer Toshizo Tanaka told reporters earlier this month. Mr. Tanaka said the company made the conservative earnings outlook, taking into account the possibility that the U.S. Federal Reserve may not raise interest rates this year, which could cause the dollar to fall against the yen. Still, despite weak demand at home, a 0.9% overall growth figure would still be better than Japan<U+2019>s potential growth rate as estimated by most economists.

        "original_post": "LAS VEGAS<U+2014>Nevada Democratic leaders basked in victory Tuesday evening in Las Vegas amid a bleaker national picture for the party, celebrating wins in a close senate and congressional race, as well as taking over the state assembly. Catherine Cortez Masto became the first Latina elected to the U.S. Senate to hold retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid<U+2019>s seat, while Ruben Kihuen<U+2014>an immigrant from Mexico and long a rising star in state Democratic politics<U+2014>won a close congressional race in a district that had been Republican for the past few years. Speaking prior to Donald Trump winning the presidency , Ms. Cortez Masto vowed to fight against Mr. Trump and to try to work to pass comprehensive immigration reform. <U+201C>I think we can all agree this is all a little bittersweet,<U+201D> Ms. Cortez Masto said. She added, <U+201C>if Donald Trump is the president, I<U+2019>ll tell you this, our government is built on a system of checks and balances and I will promise you this, I will be one hell of a check and balance on him. This is our fight for our future and the America we know it should be and nobody, nobody is going to take that away from us.<U+201D> Democrats also celebrated the electoral votes Mrs. Clinton won in the state and appeared on track to win an additional Republican-held congressional seat and possibly control of the state senate. The result indicated a massive victory for the labor union and minority coalition machine built over years in the state by Mr. Reid, who is retiring. In a speech before supporters, Ms. Cortez Masto also thanked Mr. Reid, who wasn't present. <U+201C>This Democratic victory here in Nevada is possible because of him and this is his night too and you should all thank him for that,<U+201D> Ms. Cortez Masto said. Mr. Kihuen and Ms. Cortez Masto both spoke of their own backgrounds as sending important messages, with Ms. Cortez Masto talking about her great-grandfather who immigrated from Italy and grandfather who immigrated from Mexico. Mr. Kihuen spoke of immigrating from Mexico with his family and achieving the American dream. <U+201C>Don<U+2019>t you think it is about time that our government and the representation of our government mirrors the people that we serve every day,<U+201D> Ms. Cortez Masto said. <U+201C>I am so excited to be the voice at the table for all of us.<U+201D> Soon after Ms. Cortez Masto spoke, Mr. Trump was declared president and many at a Democratic party began to openly sob and comfort one another with big hugs. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s bittersweet,<U+201D> said Congresswoman Dina Titus, who easily won re-election. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m very proud Nevada delivered. Tonight you can say we<U+2019>re a pretty solid blue state.<U+201D> Asked why Nevada seemed to part with many other swing states, Ms. Titus credited the Democrats<U+2019> ground game in the state. <U+201C>Minorities and gays and labor left it all on the field,<U+201D> Ms. Titus said.

        "original_post": "HONG KONG<U+2014>The Chinese yuan is on track for its worst monthly performance in more than a year in November, as the surging U.S. dollar continues to force the currency to weaken. China<U+2019>s central bank on Monday set the yuan lower against the U.S. dollar for a 12th consecutive day in its daily fix, at 6.8985 against the dollar, a fresh eight-year low for the currency. The yuan has weakened 1.7% against the dollar so far this month, with gains accelerating since the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president on Nov. 8. His planned economic stimulus has increased expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will have to act more aggressively to contain inflation, prompting strength in the dollar against most major global currencies. It is the worst one-month performance for the yuan since August 2015, when a surprise move to a market-determined exchange rate prompted a sharp devaluation of the yuan and losses for equities world-wide, as investors grappled with the new regime. The yuan weakened 2.6% against the U.S. dollar that month. Onshore, where the Chinese currency is allowed to trade within 2% of the so-called daily fix, the yuan weakened 0.1% to 6.8945 against the U.S. dollar in trading Monday. In Hong Kong, where the currency trades freely around the clock, the offshore yuan was last flat against the U.S. dollar at 6.9118. Funds have fled emerging markets and headed to the U.S. and Japan since the U.S. election, said Alexander Lee, Hong Kong and China strategist at DBS Vickers in Hong Kong. That drove the dollar higher and put pressure on the yuan as a result. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s mainly driven by the stronger dollar,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re approaching the levels around 7 where the market will likely think the decline is over.<U+201D> DBS Vickers expects the yuan to fall to 7.08 against the dollar by the third quarter of next year. The yuan was broadly stable against the Thomson Reuters\/HKEX renminbi currency index, which tracks its strength against a basket of 14 currencies, designed to broadly reflect the gauge that the PBOC targets. The index was last flat at 95.38, retracing some gains seen Friday. Write to Gregor Stuart Hunter at gregor.hunter@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Momentum in the 2016 presidential election shifted to Donald Trump just before corporate Europe was waking up Wednesday, confounding leaders of many global firms who spent the rest of the day puzzling out what comes next. Early in the morning, Volkswagen AG Chief Executive Matthias M<U+00FC>ller and his aide, Hans-Gerd Bode, climbed into the back of a Porsche Panamera luxury sedan and switched on the TV monitor to watch live coverage of the U.S. election on German morning television. The firm has spent the past year embroiled in a global emissions scandal , and is in the middle of discussions with officials in Washington over a settlement of criminal proceedings. As the driver steered through the streets of Stuttgart and onto the A8 highway to Munich, where Mr. M<U+00FC>ller was due to speak at an auto industry conference later in the day, he was stunned that Mr. Trump had been elected. <U+201C>He was wondering about the election prognosis and all those experts who mentioned during the last weeks that Clinton is more in front than Trump,<U+201D> Mr. Bode said. As the car sped along the Autobahn, Mr. M<U+00FC>ller also wondered what impact Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election would have on Volkswagen<U+2019>s negotiations with U.S. authorities. Later in the day, Mr. Muller told reporters he hoped the election result <U+201C>won<U+2019>t have more negative consequences for Volkswagen,<U+201D> he said. Airbus Group SE Chief Executive Tom Enders in Toulouse, France, learned about Mr. Trump<U+2019>s likely victory when he woke up before 4:45 a.m. local time. He swapped messages with his communications chief, Rainer Ohler. The plane maker has big customers for its commercial jets in the U.S., as well as a big, pending order from Iran. That was made possible by Obama administration efforts to lift sanctions on Tehran <U+2014>a deal Mr. Trump has opposed. <U+201C>We both couldn<U+2019>t believe it,<U+201D> said Mr. Ohler. Mr. Enders went for his daily run, anyway, and then met Mr. Ohler at Airbus<U+2019>s headquarters to watch Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory speech on TV. Santo Versace, chairman of Milan-based fashion house Gianni Versace, woke early Wednesday to see the results of the election. Even before the result was called, he got the sense that Mr. Trump had the edge. He began to text friends saying the Republican was on the brink of victory. <U+201C>But I got no reply,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>Only silence. If I were American, I would probably have voted for Hillary. But this is a victory against the political establishment and that<U+2019>s what she represented.<U+201D> Marco Bizzarri, chief executive of fashion house Gucci, had just landed in Paris from a flight from Beijing when he was surprised to hear the news of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory. <U+201C>My first thought was that pollsters should consider changing jobs,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>They are totally unable to capture the intentions of people in an interconnected world.<U+201D> Write to William Boston at william.boston@wsj.com and Manuela Mesco at manuela.mesco@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Hillary Clinton has won Colorado<U+2019>s nine electoral votes, bringing the purplish state more firmly into the blue column. Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s won with 48.6% of the vote, when the Associated Press called the race with 59% of precincts reporting. Colorado, a perennial presidential battleground , for months appeared to be tilting Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s way, bolstered by a surge in Hispanic voter registration. Though the state voted consistently for Republicans before 2008, its population<U+2014>which had grown younger and more racially diverse<U+2014>delivered two wins for Barack Obama. In an early sign of confidence of a Colorado victory, Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign took down its advertising in the state in late July. She visited Colorado more often than Donald Trump, her Republican rival, over the summer, and her campaign opened twice the number of field offices. But her polling lead narrowed in the contest<U+2019>s final few weeks, and Mr. Trump began contesting the state once more in earnest by making more appearances there. One week before Election Day, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s team announced they planned new ads in the state, prompting Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s team to resume its advertising as well. Mr. Trump hoped to win the state by running up his margin of victory with white voters to counteract Hispanic voters<U+2019> preference for Mrs. Clinton.",

        "original_post": "This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. For thousands of public servants <U+2014> Democrat, Republican and independent <U+2014> the election of Donald Trump creates a deep quandary: Should I stay or should I go? These are the men and women around the country who work for the Justice Department, the Education Department, the Defense Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, and so much else. Many of them, no doubt, voted for Trump. But many of them are in despair, worried not only about their country but about how their own jobs will change <U+2014> and about their own moral responsibilities. My answer to the vast majority of them is: We need you. We need your professionalism, your expertise, your respect for democratic norms and American values. Stay on. Stay on, please, for your country. My colleague Ross Douthat took on a version of the question , addressing in particular Republican foreign-policy experts who<U+2019>d opposed Trump. And his argument applies across the board: <U+201C>... a hard question looms: If they fear how Trump might govern, can they in good conscience work for him? <U+201C>The answer, for now, is that they can and should <U+2014> and indeed, precisely because they fear how Trump might govern, there is a moral responsibility to serve. <U+201C>For the next four years, the most important check on what we<U+2019>ve seen of Trump<U+2019>s worst impulses <U+2014> his hair-trigger temper, his rampant insecurity, his personal cruelty <U+2014> won<U+2019>t come from Congress or the courts or the opposition party. It will come from the people charged with executing the basic responsibilities of government within his administration.<U+201D> The alternative helps to highlight the importance of staying on. This moment would be precisely the worst one to have our government emptied of experience and expertise and filled, much more than usual, with political appointees. Staying on does not equal unquestionably following every directive from Washington <U+2013> far from it. As Ross wrote, <U+201C>If a Trump presidency lurches into naked authoritarianism <U+2014> abusing executive authority in unprecedented ways, issuing immoral or illegal orders to the military <U+2014> then there will be an obligation not to serve, but to resign.<U+201D> For now, however, the country needs its federal employees more than ever.

        "original_post": "There are no certainties in politics<U+2014>these days especially<U+2014>so no predictions here about Angela Merkel <U+2019>s chances of being re-elected Chancellor of Germany next year now that she<U+2019>s decided to run for a fourth term. But given the shambolic state of the political opposition, her chances look exceedingly good. Mrs. Merkel<U+2019>s announcement, delivered at a meeting of Christian Democrats on Sunday, was widely cheered by stability-seeking Germans and investors. Had she chosen to retire, it<U+2019>s not clear who could have credibly led her center-right party, which has been in power since 2005. As for her opponents, the center-left and Russia-friendly Social Democrats are running poorly in the polls, while the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany, or AfD, is too far-right for most voters, despite gaining ground in recent local elections. Mrs. Merkel<U+2019>s enduring electoral strength means that Germany is likely to be spared the political shocks that have recently paralyzed or transformed politics in countries such as Spain and Britain. It also helps that Germany<U+2019>s economy has been growing at what counts in Europe as a healthy rate<U+2014>1.7% year-on-year in the third quarter. Unemployment is remarkably low, at 3.8%, and the labor-participation rate is higher than America<U+2019>s. But these advantages mask problems that German politicians should be discussing more publicly. Too many Germans are stuck in low-paying temporary jobs as labor laws still deter employers from hiring full-timers. Low global energy prices have masked the costs of Mrs. Merkel<U+2019>s ruinously expensive green-energy Energiewende, but that will change with the next commodity boom. And recent woes at Deutsche Bank may suggest trouble ahead for other German banks. Germans also remain deeply skeptical about Mrs. Merkel<U+2019>s open-door policy to refugees from the Middle East. So far the most vocal opposition has come from AfD, which has lent the issue a disreputable taint among mainstream voters. But the issue of rapidly assimilating so many refugees isn<U+2019>t going to go away, and Germany could use a more honest public debate about how much migration it is willing to accept, and at what cost. Germany<U+2019>s next leader will also face a changing, and more dangerous, European-security picture. Vladimir Putin wants to dominate in the east and neuter the NATO alliance if he can. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s intentions toward Europe aren<U+2019>t clear, though he is sure to demand that NATO members such as Germany contribute more to their defense. All of this should play to Mrs. Merkel<U+2019>s strengths, assuming she can avoid more migration-like mistakes. Germany has been Europe<U+2019>s anchor in a turbulent decade, and there<U+2019>s plenty to recommend a familiar and steadying Chancellor. But Germany also runs the risk of letting stability turn into stagnation. Whatever the outcome of next year<U+2019>s election, Germans deserve a vigorous political debate about the challenges they face in an increasingly dangerous world.",

Speaking in Greece, he announced that the process of globalization needs a <U+201C>course correction<U+201D> because the benefits aren<U+2019>t being spread broadly. Well, maybe, but this is a little much to hear from the man who has been nominally the leader of the globalizing world<U+2019>s course for eight years. The President spent his years stressing income redistribution over economic growth, and the result has been less growth and more inequality. That<U+2019>s a major reason for the West<U+2019>s political anxiety over foreign trade and immigration. Those anxieties were muted in the booming 1980s and 1990s. From Greece it was onto Germany and a meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel, where Mr. Obama next lectured President-elect Donald Trump on making deals with Vladimir Putin out of convenience, <U+201C>even if it violates international norms, or even if it leaves smaller countries vulnerable or creates long-term problems in regions like Syria.<U+201D> He added that if Chancellor Merkel chooses re-election next year, <U+201C>she will have big burdens. I wish I could be there to lighten her load.<U+201D> Mrs. Merkel<U+2019>s load is an overwhelming flow of refugees into Germany out of Syria and Mr. Putin<U+2019>s aggressions to her east. Both problems resulted in large part from Mr. Obama<U+2019>s reluctance to support the Syrian opposition until it was too late and reluctance to send Ukraine military support as Mr. Putin<U+2019>s armed surrogates invaded. What Chancellor Merkel and Europe need most is a U.S. President more willing to lead the West than talk about it.",

The mayor said his administration would sue to keep Muslims in New York from being required to register with the federal government if Mr. Trump, a Republican, decides to proceed with a Muslim registry, which he proposed on the campaign trail. He said the New York Police Department won<U+2019>t comply with any mandate for more aggressive stop-and-frisk policing. Mr. Trump has often mentioned the stop-and-frisk tactic, routinely used before Mr. de Blasio became mayor, as a way to reduce crime. NYPD officers still use the tract but less frequently, and major crime keeps declining, records show. <U+2018> We will use all the tools at our disposal to stand up for our people. <U+2019> A spokeswoman for the president-elect didn<U+2019>t respond to a request for comment. The city could lose federal funding for several programs if the mayor declines to follow the federal government<U+2019>s orders. If need be, Mr. de Blasio said he would risk a loss in federal funding. The city depends on Washington for about 10% of its $83 billion budget. For now, Mr. de Blasio appears to be trying to reap the political benefits of standing up against Mr. Trump in a city where Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won four-to-one. Mr. de Blasio has decided to make Mr. Trump a hallmark of his 2017 re-election campaign, using the president-elect as a foil. Mr. Trump has described Mr. de Blasio as the <U+201C>worst mayor in the U.S.<U+201D> Last week, Messrs. Trump and de Blasio met for about an hour at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. After the meeting, Mr. de Blasio told allies he had no idea how Mr. Trump would govern, according to a person familiar with the matter. <U+201C>My essential message to him was to remember where you come from,<U+201D> Mr. de Blasio said Monday, referring to his meeting with Mr. Trump. The speech at Cooper Union featured a group of diverse New Yorkers behind the mayor on stage, including a Muslim NYPD officer. When the mayor finished speaking, a choir, made up of mostly black children, came in singing <U+201C>This Land is Your Land.<U+201D> Write to Josh Dawsey at JOSHUA.DAWSEY@dowjones.com",

        "original_post": "LONDON<U+2014> Airbus Group SE has received U.S. government backing for the export of more than 100 jetliners to Iran, despite a move by U.S. lawmakers to curb such transactions. The export license was granted on Tuesday by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, an arm of the Treasury Department, and clears Airbus to deliver more than $20 billion in jets to Iran Air, the Islamic Republic<U+2019>s flag carrier. Iran Air and Airbus in January agreed on the potential sale of up to 118 jetliners. It was a landmark transaction and one of the most high-profile deals for Iran following the lifting of sanctions as part of a wider accord to significantly constrain the country<U+2019>s nuclear activities. Airbus, Europe<U+2019>s biggest plane maker, in September won U.S. government backing to deliver 17 planes to Iran Air. Boeing at the time also received approval to sell planes to the carrier. Airbus initially sought license for a smaller number of planes to expedite the process to get planes to Iran Air, which has been struggling with an aging fleet after years of sanctions, some imposed in the wake of its revolution in 1979. Iran Air operates some of the world<U+2019>s oldest airliners. The Airbus and Boeing plane deals have been staunchly opposed by critics of the nuclear accord with Iran. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has attacked the Iran deal and named retired Army Gen. Mike Flynn as national security adviser and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) as Central Intelligence Agency director. Both have voiced opposition to the nuclear deal. The Obama administrated has been working to strengthen the accord , including by granting more export licenses for business to sell in Iran. The effort is unrelated to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election victory, U.S. officials have said. Airbus said it was still working with Iran Air to complete contract terms before any planes will be handed over. Iran Air has said it was looking to buy a wide range of Airbus aircraft, from its popular A320 single-aisle plane to the A380 superjumbo. The initial license for 17 planes covered A320 jets and A330 long-range planes. Iranian officials have said they were close to completing the contract. The U.S. House of Representatives last week passed a motion to block dollar funding for such transactions. The move isn't expected to have any immediate impact on plane deliveries, though. Airbus<U+2019>s plane sales to Iran Air are expected to be denominated in euros. Boeing also is likely to use nondollar transactions to deliver its planes. Boeing aims to sell 80 jets to Iran Air in a deal valued at up to $17.6 billion. It would include its new 777X long-range jet, which is still in development, and the 747-8 jumbo jets. Iran<U+2019>s large domestic population and lack of new planes have made it among the most attractive new markets for plane makers. Some local carriers, however, remain under U.S. sanctions because of ties to individuals the U.S. accuses of aiding terrorists or Iran<U+2019>s ballistic missile program.

        "original_post": "Bloomberg LP announced a series of changes across its news organization on Thursday, including a revamp and new leadership at its money-losing magazine Bloomberg Businessweek and the end of its high-priced political news program, <U+201C>With All Due Respect.<U+201D> In addition, approximately 30 Bloomberg News journalists were let go Thursday across the U.S., Europe and Asia as part of an effort to merge the company<U+2019>s Bloomberg First Word and markets news teams, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg employs about 2,600 journalists and analysts world-wide. A new version of Bloomberg Businessweek will launch toward the end of the second quarter next year, Bloomberg Editor in Chief John Micklethwait and Bloomberg Media Chief Executive Justin Smith wrote in a memo to staff. The revamp is necessary because its business model is <U+201C>too reliant<U+201D> on print advertising, which is in rapid decline industrywide. A person familiar with the matter said the publication, which Bloomberg acquired in 2009, was on pace to lose between $20 million and $30 million this year. The magazine<U+2019>s business model has <U+201C>not evolved as quickly as the market around it<U+2014>and does not have enough of a focus on digital innovation,<U+201D> Mr. Micklethwait and Mr. Smith wrote. <U+201C>Working out the exact details of this new BBW is the job of the next few months. But we are already clear that it requires deep change.<U+201D> The memo said the magazine<U+2019>s editor, Ellen Pollock, and her deputy, Brad Wieners, would be leaving the company. Ms. Pollock will be succeeded by Washington Bureau Chief Megan Murphy. The move comes as newspapers and magazines struggle with an accelerating decline of print advertising revenue that has led to staffing cutbacks across the industry. The Wall Street Journal recently offered buyouts and began laying off staffers amid a 21% ad revenue decline; the New York Times has similarly warned of staff reductions next year; and Gannett Co. recently laid off around 380 staffers across its approximately 120 newspaper properties. In a separate memo on Thursday, Bloomberg said its daily political show, <U+201C>With All Due Respect,<U+201D> would draw to a close on Dec. 2 as the company revamps its political coverage after the U.S. election. The show launched in 2014 with the big-ticket hires of well-known Beltway chroniclers, John Heilemann and Mark Halperin. For the rest of the year, the show<U+2019>s team will focus on producing a series of hourlong features previewing the presidency of Donald Trump. After the inauguration, Bloomberg said it would look to launch a new show focused on global politics. The company said it would similarly transition the focus of its political coverage on the web more globally and that Messrs. Heilemann and Halperin would step back from full-time roles but continue as contributors and columnists. Write to Lukas I. Alpert at lukas.alpert@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Tuition increases at U.S. colleges rose relatively slowly after rapid rises during and immediately after the 2007-2009 recession, but stagnant wages, very low inflation and a slight pullback in grants to students continue to amplify those modest jumps and fuel concern about college affordability. Published tuition for the 2016-17 academic year rose 2.4% for in-state students at four-year public schools<U+2014>slowing from 2.9% last year, according to a report released<U+00A0>Wednesday<U+00A0>from the College Board, a New York nonprofit that tracks university costs and administers the SAT. In-state students attending public four-year institutions now pay $20,090 on average for tuition, fees and room and board, up from $19,570 in 2015-16. Private-school costs rose $1,500<U+00A0>from the previous academic year<U+00A0>to $45,370. Since 2006-07, the annual sticker price for in-state students at a four-year public school jumped by nearly $5,000, while the cost of a four-year private school increased by more than $9,000 in inflation-adjusted dollars. Institutional aid and tax benefits have failed to keep pace. As a result, 68% of graduating seniors had student loan debt in 2015, averaging $30,100 per borrower, according to the Institute for College Access and Success. That debt represents a 4% increase over 2014 graduates. Anxiety about that debt has become a pivotal issue in the 2016 presidential race . Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has put forward a plan to allow any American from a household making up to $85,000 a year, to attend their state colleges tuition-free . Critics of the plan say it would lead to higher costs with few incentives to spend the money efficiently. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has called for lowering college costs by removing what he characterizes as burdensome federal regulations on schools that have led to <U+201C>administrative bloat.<U+201D><U+00A0>He also favors<U+00A0>plans that allow students to pay back loans tied to future earnings and<U+00A0>removing tax breaks on college endowments. Average in-state tuition varies considerably between states. For instance, in Wyoming students pay $5,060. In Vermont, students pay $15,650. In nine states, tuition has been relatively flat over the past five years. In nine others, costs have surged by more than 20%. The cost of public universities tracks closely with the economy, tax revenues and state subsidies to higher education. Over the past few decades, states have pushed an ever greater share of higher-education costs to students in the form of tuition and fee increases. That trend is amplified during recessions.

        "original_post": "Chris Wallace is receiving widespread praise for the way he moderated the third presidential debate last week, and deservedly so. He was fair to both candidates, firm in handling their interruptions, and did his best to draw out the candidates on their substantive differences. But there<U+2019>s another reason he was more effective: He asked questions that would never have even occurred to the other moderators. Mr. Wallace<U+2019>s personal politics are a mystery to us, but his position as an anchor at Fox News (where we have a weekly TV show) means he is exposed to political points of view that are alien at most other media outlets. The best example was Mr. Wallace<U+2019>s first question on the Supreme Court. First he let Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump explain the philosophies that would inform their nominees for the Supreme Court. But then he drilled down into gun control and abortion in ways that media big shots rarely do. On guns, he challenged Mrs. Clinton on her opposition to the Supreme Court<U+2019>s Heller decision that ruled the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms. Her evasive response showed she doesn<U+2019>t believe in such an individual right. On abortion, Mr. Wallace teased out Mr. Trump<U+2019>s views on Roe v. Wade , but he also challenged Mrs. Clinton on her support for abortions at any time during pregnancy. Most journalists share a center-left worldview that means they are rarely challenged about their underlying ideological assumptions. Mr. Wallace was effective because he asked questions based on premises from the right and left. That<U+2019>s a credit to Mr. Wallace but it<U+2019>s also a lesson for Republicans. Our advice would be that Republicans in the future agree to attend debates only if they<U+2019>re moderated by Mr. Wallace or someone who has demonstrated similar ideological breadth in questioning politicians of both parties. They<U+2019>d be doing themselves and the country a service.",

        "original_post": "LONDON<U+2014>British Prime Minister Theresa May plans to use a Monday speech to position the U.K. as a pioneer in responding to the backlash against international trade, drawing a distinction between her view on free trade and that of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Less than a week after Mr. Trump was elected on the back of attacks against political insiders and with pledges to renegotiate free-trade deals that he blames for economic ills, Mrs. May plans to emphasize the U.K.<U+2019>s opportunity to be a leader for other countries as it exits the European Union. According to excerpts of the speech from her office, she will urge the U.K. to be a champion of free trade while supporting families and communities that can lose out to it. The planned speech underscores the differences between her and Mr. Trump on trade. While Mrs. May has repeatedly said the U.K. will continue to be one of the strongest advocates for international trade as it leaves the EU, Mr. Trump has blamed free-trade agreements for rising inequality and job losses in the U.S. <U+201C>As we leave the European Union, we will also use the strength and size of our economy to lead the way in getting out into the world and doing new business with old allies and new partners alike,<U+201D> she will say, according to excerpts. She will say that the government will be <U+201C>unashamedly pro-business<U+201D> and promote free markets but that it would rebalance the economy to reduce inequalities across the country. In both Britain<U+2019>s EU referendum in June and the U.S. election, voters in the U.K. and the U.S. appeared to reject free trade and open markets, in a sign that they believe global economic integration has gone too far. Mrs. May, who came to office in July, will have to strike a difficult balance in sending governments and companies around the world the message that the U.K. is open for business while responding to concerns at home about rising immigration and the effects of globalization. Mrs. May has suggested that in coming negotiations with the 27 other EU member states she will prioritize controlling immigration over retaining membership in the EU<U+2019>s single trading market. But she has said that she wants maximum access to trade with EU states, which other leaders have said the U.K. can<U+2019>t have if it doesn<U+2019>t keep its borders open to migrants from the bloc.

        "original_post": "Donald J. Trump suggested on Monday that Hillary Clinton was too <U+201C>tough<U+201D> in her language about Russia, and said that if he won the election, he might meet with President Vladimir V. Putin before being sworn in. Mr. Trump made the remarks in an interview with the conservative radio host Michael Savage , who repeatedly affirmed Mr. Trump<U+2019>s recent claims that the mainstream media was attempting to thwart him. Mr. Trump told Mr. Savage that the United States<U+2019> current leadership, as well as Mrs. Clinton, was too aggressive against Mr. Putin. <U+201C>They insult him constantly <U+2014> I mean, no wonder he can<U+2019>t stand Obama and Hillary Clinton,<U+201D> Mr. Trump said, calling the tensions a <U+201C>very serious problem.<U+201D> <U+201C>It is the worst situation that we<U+2019>ve had with Russia since the end of the Cold War, by far,<U+201D> he said. Mr. Trump added that <U+201C>she shouldn<U+2019>t be talking so tough<U+201D> about Russia, and he suggested, as he has repeatedly in recent months, that Russia could be an ally in fighting the Islamic State. <U+201C>We have Putin, who has no respect for Obama at all <U+2014> doesn<U+2019>t like him, and doesn<U+2019>t respect him,<U+201D> Mr. Trump told Mr. Savage, calling the difficulties <U+201C>a really catastrophic situation here, I<U+2019>ll be honest with you.<U+201D> He added, <U+201C>If I win on Nov. 8, I could see myself meeting with Putin and meeting with Russia prior to the start of the administration.<U+201D> Democrats have often assailed Mr. Trump for his comments about Mr. Putin, whom he has characterized as a stronger leader than President Obama . Mr. Trump, who has declined to make his tax returns public, has denied that he has business interests in Russia. But he has also refused to acknowledge that the United States intelligence officials have attributed the hacking of the Democratic National Committee to Russian hackers who they said must have had the approval of the Kremlin<U+2019>s top leaders. But beyond the potential meeting with Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump did not offer a strategy for dealing with Moscow.

        "original_post": "Republican nominee Donald Trump on Thursday said it was <U+201C>an illegal act<U+201D> for NBC to release earlier this month a 2005 videotape of him making lewd comments about women, and threatened to take legal action against the network. In an interview with Fox News<U+2019>s Bill O<U+2019>Reilly that aired Thursday, Mr. Trump once again defended his comments<U+2014>in which he said of groping women, <U+201C>when you<U+2019>re a star, they let you do it<U+201D><U+2014>as <U+201C>locker-room talk,<U+201D> and added: <U+201C>The microphone was not supposed to be on<U+2014>not that I make that as an excuse for myself, but certainly it was an illegal act that was NBC. It was not supposed to be on.<U+201D> Asked to clarify whether he thought it was illegal that NBC had released the tape, from a filming of <U+201C>Access Hollywood,<U+201D> he said, <U+201C>Oh, absolutely. You know that was a private dressing room<U+2014>yeah that was certainly illegal, no question about it.<U+201D> The tape shows Mr. Trump speaking on a bus with the show<U+2019>s name on it as he arrived on the set of the soap opera <U+201C>Days of Our Lives.<U+201D> On whether he would seek legal action against NBC, Mr. Trump said <U+201C>you<U+2019>re going to see after the election,<U+201D> and added, <U+201C>We<U+2019>re gonna find out soon enough, I will tell you.<U+201D> Earlier this month, both the Washington Post and NBC reported on tapes obtained from the <U+201C>Access Hollywood<U+201D> filming in which a recently married Mr. Trump professed his penchant for kissing women <U+2014><U+201C>Just kiss. I don<U+2019>t even wait<U+201D><U+2014>and said, <U+201C>Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.<U+201D> Mr. Trump was speaking to then-<U+201C>Access Hollywood<U+201D> anchor Billy Bush, who has since been fired by the network. Since the tape<U+2019>s release, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s standing in the polls has fallen, as a series of women have alleged that he sexually assaulted them. Mr. Trump has denied the allegations. A Real Clear Politics average of recent national polls shows Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton with a lead of nearly 6 percentage points. NBC is the latest entity Mr. Trump has threatened with a lawsuit in recent weeks. After the New York Times earlier this month published the accounts of two women who said Mr. Trump had inappropriately touched them, the nominee threatened to sue the newspaper for libel . Last weekend, he for the first time he threatened to sue the women who have accused him of making unwanted sexual advances toward them. Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "LIMA, Peru<U+2014>President Barack Obama said he advised Donald Trump, the New York businessman who will succeed him, to secure a strong White House counsel to avoid any possible conflicts of interest generated by the president-elect<U+2019>s global business interests. Mr. Obama, speaking at a news conference at the end of a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Peru , also suggested that Mr. Trump should completely distance himself from his far-flung corporate operations. <U+201C>When I met with the president-elect, I suggested to him that having a strong White House counsel that could provide clear guide posts and rules would benefit him and benefit his team because it would eliminate a lot of ambiguity,<U+201D> Mr. Obama said. <U+201C>I think it will be up to him to make determinations about how he wants to approach it. I know what worked for us.<U+201D> The issue of conflicts of interest given Mr. Trump<U+2019>s widespread business entanglements has emerged as a key question over his transition into the presidency.<U+00A0>They gained headlines this weekend when several news outlets reported that the president-elect last week met with business associates from India . Jason Miller, a Trump transition spokesman, said the family is <U+201C>working through that with the<U+00A0>lawyers<U+00A0>to make sure that everything is being done properly.<U+201D> The transition team didn't immediately response to Mr. Obama<U+2019>s remarks in Peru. One of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s primary campaign attorneys, Donald F. McGahn II, has advised elected officials and national parties and he has been among those meeting with the president-elect in the last week, as seen by the roster of officials entering the president-elect<U+2019>s offices in New York. Mr. McGahn is a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, which oversee campaign finance issues; the Justice Department deals with conflicts of interest for elected officials. Noting that he had far fewer assets than Mr. Trump, Mr. Obama said when he entered the White House in 2009 he decided to liquidate assets <U+201C>that might raise questions about how it would influence policy.<U+201D> He said he had his accountant put much of his money in Treasury bills <U+201C>just because it simplified my life.<U+201D> <U+201C>I did not have to worry about the complexities of whether a decision I made might inadvertently benefit me,<U+201D> Mr. Obama said. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s consistent with the broader approach that we<U+2019>ve taken throughout my administration.<U+201D> He credited his approach with his serving eight years in the White House without a major scandal about his personal holdings. Mr. Obama joked that his lawyers have advised his staff to avoid anything that sounds like it might be fun. <U+201C>Early on in the administration there would be questions about could a staff person go to this conference or what should they do about this gift that was provided,<U+201D> Mr. Obama said. <U+201C>I think it was maybe our first general counsel who was responsible for setting up our guidelines and rules inside the White House that said if it sounds like it would be fun,<U+00A0>then you can<U+2019>t do it.

        "original_post": "House Republican staffers are already writing the major tax-code overhaul they plan to advance during the first 100 days of the Trump administration and are making <U+201C>great progress,<U+201D> said the senior GOP lawmaker leading the effort. A tax rewrite is at the top of the party<U+2019>s agenda for 2017, said Rep. Kevin Brady (R., Texas), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Staff members are already writing the parts that have consensus and gathering feedback from businesses and other groups on the blueprint the party released earlier this year. <U+201C>Because Mr. Trump has made it clear he wants to do tax reform in the first 100 days, House Republicans are going to be ready,<U+201D> Mr. Brady said in an interview<U+00A0>Wednesday. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m confident that this blueprint will grow the economy significantly, simplify the tax code for families and lower their tax burden and bust up the IRS, redesign it so it<U+2019>s focused on customer service.<U+201D> The committee staff is already working on two pieces that may prove particularly tricky. One is a border-adjustable corporate tax, which would be imposed on imports and removed from exports. That can be quite complicated for banks and insurance companies. The second idea is taxing noncorporate business income at a lower rate than other individual income. Currently, both are taxed the same way on the owners<U+2019> individual returns. Mr. Brady said his team is working on a <U+201C>final design.<U+201D> The House plan and Mr. Trump<U+2019>s plan are similar, in that they both lower individual and business tax rates, repeal the estate tax and rely on assumed economic growth to cover part or all of their budgetary costs. There are differences that will need to be worked out, and Republicans will need to figure out whether they want to attempt to advance it through the Senate using a procedure that would avoid the need for any Democratic votes. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s the only way it can be done. There<U+2019>s no way there can be a bill that<U+2019>s acceptable to Republicans that can get 60 votes in the Senate,<U+201D> said Republican tax lobbyist Kenneth Kies, who said Republicans would quickly overcome any internal disagreements. <U+201C>If they don<U+2019>t get some significant stuff done between now and the midterm elections, they<U+2019>re going to get their heads handed to them.<U+201D> Write to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "The nuclear strategist Herman Kahn, writing in his book <U+201C>Thinking About the Unthinkable in the 1980s<U+201D>: The notion of Armageddon has created a self-defeating prophecy: the more frightened decision makers are, the more careful they become and the less likely they are to initiate any action that might bring about the dreaded escalation to nuclear use. Armageddon is averted to the degree it is feared. As a result, nuclear deterrence has not only worked remarkably well in peacetime and served to limit the scope and intensity of conventional warfare, but it is likely to work surprisingly well in a large U.S.-Soviet conventional, and even a limited nuclear, war. One significant indication of the effectiveness of deterrence is that the Soviet Union and the United States share the belief that a nuclear war would begin only out of desperation or inadvertence. A weakening of deterrence could increase the possibility of a calculated <U+201C>voluntary<U+201D> war or worse. Deterrence is part objective and part subjective. The objective part is that adequate military preparedness could be critical in some important circumstances. The subjective is, in part, the perception by the potential enemy of the other side<U+2019>s power, determination, and courage, as well as its estimate of the wartime effectiveness of the other side<U+2019>s relative nuclear capability. If the aggressor believes that his opponent has the weapons and will use them, deterrence is likely to be effective. Therefore, a nation<U+2019>s defense lies, in part, in the credibility of its threat to use nuclear force as a last resort , which means that the need remains for coherent and plausible policies for the use of nuclear weapons.",

        "original_post": "In the Trump-trade bond-market selloff , the emerging markets that led the pack are the ones being left behind. Emerging-market debt funds last week suffered their largest net redemptions on record, $6.6 billion, as investors were drawn away by a strong dollar. Yet the worst-hit aren<U+2019>t the weakest markets, like Russia and Turkey, but some of the more resilient. Excess returns above benchmark indexes on emerging-market high-grade bonds have been the worst in the bond world , smaller than their junk peers offer. Take Malaysia, whose investment-grade government bonds, a favorite of foreigners, had been among the best total-return performers this year. Investors have essentially brushed off political risk<U+2014>discounting a wide-ranging corruption scandal and defaults on debt linked to state-backed sovereign fund 1MDB. But since the U.S. election, the currency is down 5% against the dollar. Yields on government bonds have surged 0.8 percentage point, close to the <U+201C>taper-tantrum<U+201D> rise of 2013<U+2014>except then it took three months, not less than two weeks. Malaysian credit-default swaps have surged over 0.4 percentage point, double that of other emerging markets. Looking to damp speculation, the central bank warned against betting on a weaker ringgit using nondeliverable forwards. While Malaysia has little dollar debt, it has allowed currency risk to slip in through the back door. Offshore investors now hold a record 52% of its government securities<U+2014>among the highest in emerging markets, putting it in the company of the likes of South Africa. As these dollarized investors see losses, they turn tail. That<U+2019>s when issues like Malaysia<U+2019>s reserve adequacy grow more critical. The IMF<U+2019>s composite measure of financial strength in the face of external stress<U+2014>which includes reserves, external debt, balance of payments and the like<U+2014>has fallen to 80%, below the 100% to 150% recommended range. As a highly rated country whose securities are part of global and emerging-market bond indexes, Malaysia benefited greatly from the flows to emerging markets this year, which have been large by historical standards. The tide is now reversing, causing investors to reassess sooner than expected. All of a sudden, Malaysia<U+2019>s problems seem a lot more relevant.

        "original_post": "Americans and the markets were in a giving mood last year, driving donor-advised funds to record levels. Contributions jumped 11% in 2015 to $22.26 billion, marking the seventh-straight year of double-digit growth in contributions, according to an annual report by National Philanthropic Trust in Jenkintown, Pa. At year-end, total charitable assets in the accounts rose 12% to $78.64 billion,<U+00A0>also boosted by market gains. And grants from the funds to qualified charities totaled $14.52 billion in 2015, up 17% from the year before. Donor-advised funds let investors receive a tax deduction for a charitable donation immediately but give them the flexibility to make charitable grants later on. When people give appreciated securities to a donor-advised fund, or directly to an individual charity, they can usually deduct the full market value of the securities and avoid paying capital-gains tax on the amount by which they have grown in value. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re seeing more donors with big, taxable events,<U+201D> says Eileen Heisman, chief executive of National Philanthropic Trust, which manages $3 billion in charitable assets. There are 269,180 donor-advised accounts in the U.S., 11% higher from 2014, according to the report, which examined 2015 data from more than 1,000 donor-advised funds. The average account reached a record $235,727, up 8.8% The rise of online giving, especially among millennials, has helped propel the funds<U+2019> growth, Ms. Heisman says. <U+201C>Millennials are all about giving online,<U+201D> she says. Winnie Sun, a financial adviser in Irvine, Calif., says she has seen an increase in interest in donor-advised funds from her clients, especially as the year comes to an end and they look for a place to put their charitable dollars. More donors are giving illiquid assets such as closely held stock, art or farmland, she says. And several of Ms. Sun<U+2019>s clients had companies acquired this year, leaving them with more liquidity and substantial taxes. <U+201C>Donor-advised funds are something easy for them to set up and give to,<U+201D> she says. Ms. Sun says her millennial clients tend to give animal-related charities, antibullying and environmental causes. Her boomer clients are more inclined to give to the arts, health-related causes and charities that help underprivileged children, she says. One wild card for the growth in donor-advised funds: President-elect Donald Trump. Mr. Trump has proposed boosting the amount of the <U+201C>standard deduction,<U+201D> which would reduce the number of people who itemize deductions (and possibly make them less motivated to give to charity). While it is <U+201C>hard to know<U+201D> the effect Mr. Trump<U+2019>s presidency will have on donor-advised funds, a cap on charitable deductions could put pressure on the funds<U+2019> growth in the future, Ms. Heisman says. Still, it is possible that donors will choose to lock in several years of deductions by giving more to their donor-advised funds by the end of this year, Ms. Heisman says.

        "original_post": "The stock market has a new paradigm. Forget risk-on, risk-off, the template for explaining daily market moves since the financial crisis. Focus instead on Trump-on, Trump-off, as two groups of stocks swing in tandem according to how exposed they are to the expected policies of President-elect Donald Trump. A strong link has emerged between stocks that have little in common other than that they seem to be favored by Mr. Trump<U+2019>s policies: Suppliers of construction materials, weapons manufacturers, biotechnology companies and Navient , which services student loans. There is another group, which would usually follow the biotechs up but is instead going the other way. It comprises the big Silicon Valley growth stocks , led by Amazon , Facebook and Google . Most of these moves are obvious. Mr. Trump has promised to rebuild U.S. infrastructure and spend more on defense. Unlike rival Hillary Clinton, he doesn<U+2019>t plan to forgive student loans or cap prescription-drug prices. And he has been critical of Silicon Valley giants in general and Amazon in particular, warning during the campaign that if he became president, <U+201C>they<U+2019>re going to have such problems.<U+201D> The biggest market reaction to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s surprise win is to sell bonds in the expectation of higher inflation , which has hit the price of safer bondlike stocks such as utilities and the consumer staples sector. The daily swing in stocks that could benefit or suffer from specific Trump policies hasn<U+2019>t been closely tied to the broader economic theme, although the bond selloff (and so rise in yields) moderated this week as the Trump-off trade took hold in policy-sensitive equities. Policy switches by Mr. Trump can confuse the Trump-on, Trump-off pattern, too. Companies such as HCA Holdings that benefit from the Affordable Care Act rebounded Monday<U+2014>otherwise a Trump-off day<U+2014>after Mr. Trump said he would retain some parts of Obamacare. And other factors continue to matter. In the energy sector a large postelection bounce in beaten-up coal stocks has been followed by a series of small declines. There is concern about how much difference Mr. Trump<U+2019>s promise to end the regulatory <U+201C>war on coal<U+201D> can make in the face of competition from cheap shale gas. As Mr. Trump fills out his team and decides which campaign promises he will keep, the Trump-on, Trump-off trade may last. But once he provides certainty on what he plans to do, these policy-driven stock moves should have one last hurrah before coming to an end. Write to James Mackintosh at James.Mackintosh@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "There is a fine line between keeping cool and being complacent. Credit markets appear to be skating on it. Equity markets are being stirred by the recovery in Donald Trump <U+2019>s poll ratings. Government bonds have been awoken by jitters about central banks and higher inflation . Corporate bond markets, meanwhile, seem relatively oblivious. At 1.4 percentage points in the U.S. and 1.1 points in Europe, the spread between the yield on investment-grade bonds and underlying government yields remains close to its lows for the year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Importantly, central banks are still providing support to credit markets . The European Central Bank has vacuumed up <U+20AC>37.8 billion of investment-grade bonds since June. That has helped propel a rally that has spilled over into the U.S., and allowed the market to absorb heavy issuance from companies eager to take advantage of ultralow borrowing costs. Investors might be relying too much on central-bank generosity. After all, the fortunes of the corporate bond market owe a good deal to the ultralow yields on government bonds that have underpinned the market. A surprise Trump election victory, until recently discounted as improbable, is bound to cause greater volatility and lead to questions about U.S. monetary policy <U+2013><U+2013>which so far has been more reassuring than disruptive. There are some hints of fragility. U.S. high-yield bonds, which have been on a tear, have started to back up in the past week, although year-to-date returns are still over 15%. If there is more turmoil in equity and government-bond markets ahead, corporate bonds might not be able to ignore it much longer. Write to Richard Barley at richard.barley@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "PHOENIX<U+2014>Republican Sen. John McCain won a sixth term in Arizona after a tumultuous race in which he frequently clashed with GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. Mr. McCain, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, defeated centrist Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick in what Mr. McCain had called one of the toughest races of his political career. Mr. McCain, 80 years old, won with 52.9% of the vote, compared with 41.6% for Ms. Kirkpatrick, with 35% of precincts reporting, according to the Associated Press. A household name in Arizona, the senator faced criticism from Arizona conservatives who lambasted him for seeking to pass an immigration overhaul with Democrats. But exit polls showed he held a comfortable lead over his opponent as Nov. 8 approached Last month, newspaper editorials criticized him for saying on a radio interview that he would block a Supreme Court justice nominated by Hillary Clinton if she were to win the presidency and the Senate maintained its Republican majority. In a victory speech Tuesday night, Mr. McCain said he <U+201C>will extend an open hand to our new president, and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to solve our problems together as fellow Americans, who have more in common than we have differences.<U+201D> <U+201C>Most of all, we have our citizenship in common, and that is a blessing we should honor by treating each other with respect,<U+201D> he said. Although Mr. McCain<U+2019>s opponent was Ms. Kirkpatrick, 66, a former prosecutor and state legislator, it was his clashes with Mr. Trump that dominated the race for more than a year, as Ms. Kirkpatrick worked to link the two Republicans. Mr. Trump drew reprimands from party leaders last July when he said Mr. McCain<U+2019>s five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam didn<U+2019>t make him a war hero. While he backed Mr. Trump once he won the GOP nomination, Mr. McCain criticized the New York businessman for his vows to revive waterboarding as an interrogation technique, as well as his praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin. And Mr. McCain delivered a blistering attack on Mr. Trump after he picked a public spat with the parents of a Muslim U.S. Army captain killed in Iraq. But it wasn<U+2019>t until early October, when a 2005 video surfaced showing Mr. Trump speaking in crude sexual terms about grabbing women without their consent, that Mr. McCain withdrew his endorsement for the nominee. Questions over President Barack Obama <U+2019>s signature 2010 health-care law figured prominently in the Senate race in Arizona, where many counties have only one insurer selling exchange plans for 2017 and premiums increased. Mr. McCain, a critic of the law, attacked Ms. Kirkpatrick, who voted for it. Write to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com and Miriam Jordan at miriam.jordan@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "America<U+2019>s first illegal-alien amnesty wasn<U+2019>t the biggest in our history, but it was the most influential, since we<U+2019>re still talking about it. The beneficiaries had shown a certain reckless courage in immigrating here, and a high degree of presumption. They entered without permission or papers, ignorant of local laws and customs. They didn<U+2019>t learn the language, and they kept to themselves. That they were undocumented didn<U+2019>t bother them, so firmly did they believe that no human being is illegal. Like so many Americans, they sanctified their own arrival, blessed their own immigration story above others. They were grateful to be accepted by the native-born, and glad for the handouts. Here is their version of how it went down, in 1621: <U+201C>Our harvest being gotten in, our governor sent four men on fowling, that so we might after a special manner rejoice together, after we had gathered the fruit of our labors. They four in one day killed as much fowl as, with a little help beside, served the company almost a week. <U+201C>At which time, amongst other recreations, we exercised our arms, many of the Indians coming amongst us, and among the rest their greatest king Massasoit, with some ninety men, whom for three days we entertained and feasted, and they went out and killed five deer, which they brought to the plantation and bestowed on our governor, and upon the captain and others. And although it be not always so plentiful as it was at this time with us, yet by the goodness of God, we are so far from want that we often wish you partakers of our plenty.<U+201D> Today, when you celebrate our great American holiday, remember that sense of gratitude. If, by ancestral good fortune, your family<U+2019>s foothold in the United States is uncontested, be especially thankful. Nobody<U+2019>s going to yell at you to speak Wampanoag. No one will presume criminality in you or your children. No one will chant at you: Build the wall! Thanksgiving is a lovely story we tell ourselves, about kindness and tolerance and white people fitting in. The American story got richer and deeper over time, with many grave sins and slaughters, not least for indigenous peoples, but generally hewing to a spirit of growing inclusion and welcome for newcomers. How alien that all feels today, in the dawn of Donald Trump<U+2019>s America.

        "original_post": "Small and medium-size banks in the U.S. can look forward to regulatory relief under a Donald Trump administration, but risks loom for the biggest U.S. lenders. In the aftermath of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory , one thing investors can likely be confident in is that substantial deregulation is coming for smaller banks. Bank stocks overall were trading higher<U+00A0>Wednesday afternoon in anticipation of this. A bipartisan consensus has been building for some time that smaller banks are excessively burdened by the regulatory requirements of the Dodd-Frank legislation. There are proposals on the table to raise the statutory threshold for total assets from $50 billion to $250 billion under which banks must submit to annual stress-testing by the Federal Reserve. Jeb Hensarling, Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has proposed a bill that would go further , exempting any bank from a swath of regulatory requirements in exchange for holding substantially higher levels of equity capital. Huge institutions such as J.P. Morgan Chase might figure it isn<U+2019>t worth it to raise the extra capital required. Smaller ones that find it harder to cope with regulations due to their limited resources may be willing to take the trade-off. For the biggest banks, though, there also are reasons to fret over Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory. The Republican Party platform in 2016 called for reinstating the Glass-Steagall separation of investment and commercial banking. Top-ranking Republicans in Congress may not support it, but populist forces on both the left and the right have clamored for some kind of breakup of big banks. If a bill starts moving through Congress to provide regulatory relief for smaller banks, the risk is that legislators may attach provisions pushing a breakup of big ones, notes KBW analyst Brian Gardner. That could be the price to get an otherwise deregulatory bill through a possible Senate Democrat<U+00A0>filibuster. Investors in many bank stocks have some reason to celebrate<U+00A0>Wednesday. But for the biggest banks, there is just too much uncertainty to get comfortable. Write to Aaron Back at aaron.back@wsj.com Corrections & Amplifications: Bank stocks rose Wednesday afternoon in anticipation of deregulation for smaller banks. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated they did so Monday morning. (Nov. 9, 2016)",

Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be on the short end of the debate over tax policy with Donald Trump and Mike Pence. There is no good reason for it, either. The Democrats have a tax plan that is better for most families than the Republicans<U+2019> version. But the Democratic plan is sufficiently complex that it often sounds worse. I wrote about this issue last week, and it was on display again during the vice-presidential debate . Pence cast himself and Trump as tax cutters (<U+201C>lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms<U+201D>) and Clinton and Kaine as tax hikers (<U+201C>advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases<U+201D>). What was Kaine<U+2019>s reply? An intricate five-part answer, which didn<U+2019>t get around to taxes until item number #5 and then segued to a cute line he already used once before: <U+201C>The Trump plan is a different plan. It<U+2019>s a <U+2018>you<U+2019>re fired<U+2019> plan.<U+201D> Clinton took a similar approach in her first debate with Trump, and it<U+2019>s the wrong one. Many listeners will emerge from these exchanges believing that Trump wants to cut taxes more for most people than Clinton does. In fact, nearly all of Trump<U+2019>s tax cut would go to the affluent, while Clinton has proposed a series of ( still mostly vague ) tax credits for the non-rich. There is a simple way for Clinton and Kaine to win the tax debate, and Barack Obama showed how to do it when he first ran for president, in 2008 . Democrats need to say: No, the facts are clear: We will cut taxes for the middle class more than you will. Here are the numbers<U+2026> The first step for Clinton and Kaine is to go beyond the platitudes of their tax proposals so far and offer details <U+2014> enough to allow independent analysts to score them. The second step is speaking about their plan in the direct language of politics, rather than mixing the more technical language of white papers with jokes about Trump. The next opportunity comes Sunday night, in the second debate between Clinton and Trump. This debate will be a town-hall format, where speaking the language of ordinary people is all the more important. I invite you to follow me on Twitter ( @DLeonhardt ) and join me on Facebook .

        "original_post": "Tonight wrapped up three weeks of presidential campaign debates. It was also a three-week period in which cities in at least 34 states reported record-high temperatures. New York reached 80 degrees today, and Nashville nearly hit 90. This year is all but guaranteed to be the planet<U+2019>s hottest on record, just as 2015 and 2014 were. The damage from climate change is now speeding up . And how many questions were Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Tim Kaine and Mike Pence asked about climate change over the six hours of their four combined debates? Zero. The closest was a question from a town hall participant, who asked how the country could have an energy policy that was both environmentally friendly while also <U+201C>minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers.<U+201D> The failure to ask about climate change is a failure of journalism. I thought that the debate moderators had some very fine moments over the last few weeks, calmly drawing out the candidates. But the lack of a single question on the world<U+2019>s biggest problem was a grievous error. The moderators asked about a lot of other serious issues: Syria, Russia, terrorism, tax policy, health care and the Supreme Court. They also asked about Trump<U+2019>s early morning tweets and about Clinton<U+2019>s and Trump<U+2019>s favorability ratings. Somehow, amid all of that, climate change didn<U+2019>t make the cut.

        "original_post": "AT&T Inc. Monday said its practice of exempting its own streaming video services from data-usage caps for its wireless customers complies with the law and benefits consumers, in a response to concerns from a federal regulator. The Federal Communications Commission sent a letter to AT&T almost two weeks ago over worries the practice, known as zero-rating, <U+201C>may obstruct competition and harm consumers.<U+201D> <U+201C>These initiatives are precisely the kind of pro-consumer challenges to cable that the Commission heralded in approving AT&T<U+2019>s acquisition of DirecTV,<U+201D> wrote Robert Quinn, AT&T<U+2019>s policy chief, in a letter to the agency Monday. AT&T acquired satellite-TV operator DirecTV last year. The Dallas telecom giant, which agreed to buy Time Warner Inc. for $85.4 billion last month, began zero-rating its DirecTV video app in September. Mr. Quinn said nearly three million consumers used the app in the first four weeks after its launch. AT&T plans to offer the same treatment for its over-the-top service DirecTV Now launching this month. The FCC contends the practice could deter consumers from accessing existing and future mobile video services not affiliated with AT&T. The company has said that it offers any company that wants to be zero-rated the same payment terms available to DirecTV. An FCC spokesman said the agency is reviewing the response and declined to comment further. The agency sent the letter a day after President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s victory and last week Republican congressional leaders asked the FCC to stop taking controversial regulatory actions until the new administration is on board. That suggests that the FCC may not be able to take any further steps on the AT&T matter. While critics regard zero-rating as a way of skirting net-neutrality rules that require internet-service providers to treat all traffic the same, AT&T said it <U+201C>faithfully adhered<U+201D> to those rules in starting the program, which is <U+201C>consistent with decades of commission precedent.<U+201D> Mr. Quinn said any FCC position to the contrary would be a <U+201C>radical departure from established law.<U+201D> AT&T began allowing companies to pay for zero rating in 2014, but so far no major streaming providers have done so. Verizon Communications Inc. doesn<U+2019>t charge its customers for data for its National Football League games or its go90 mobile video app. T-Mobile US Inc. <U+2019>s <U+201C>Binge On<U+201D> program allows any video provider to be exempt from data caps without paying the carrier, although the video is delivered at lower quality. It also allows customers and content companies to opt out. <U+2014>John McKinnon contributed to this article. Write to Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@wsj.com",

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, meeting with Mr. Trump last week , presented him with a special gift, according to Nikkei Asian Review: a driver made by Japan<U+2019>s Honma Golf , which specializes in gold-festooned clubs . A thoughtful choice given the president-elect<U+2019>s fondness for gold and golf, it is presumably the club that Honma said it recently sold to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for almost $5,000. The presentation is a well-timed plug for Honma, which is trying to shoot its way out of the rough. The Japan-based company, rescued by a Chinese businessman after filing for bankruptcy 11 years ago, in October had its initial public offering in Hong Kong. But hardly more than a month later, it issued a profit warning and then said its profit for the six months ended September was down by half. It was an inauspicious tee shot. The company, which dubbed itself <U+201C>golf<U+2019>s aristocracy<U+201D> in its September IPO prospectus, blamed larger-than-expected listing expenses and surprise costs in a stock-compensation plan. But even excluding those items, Honma<U+2019>s adjusted profit was only flat, a big change from near 40% annual growth in the previous two years. Investors have sliced a fifth off the stock since its debut. Honma came to the market just as everyone else seemed to be leaving. Tiger Woods<U+2019>s sponsor Nike said in August it is getting out of golf . Adidas is selling part of its golf business , including the TaylorMade brand. Honma is betting on China, which accounts for nearly a fifth of its revenue. Yet that market also faces a major challenge: The sport has gone out of fashion, a victim of the country<U+2019>s antigraft campaign. Honma shares surged 6% Monday after news of the Trump gift. To reach the green, though, the company will probably need more than just free publicity. Write to Jacky Wong at Jacky.Wong@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Shocked by both June<U+2019>s Brexit vote and November<U+2019>s victory for Donald Trump, investors are acting sooner and more decisively on political risk. That portends greater volatility in markets. In the short term, the political-risk trade sent shares of Italian banks down Monday on the first day of a bailout plan and a week ahead of a constitutional referendum. More significantly, investors are starting to react to the French presidential election , which is still several months away. Developed markets have tended to react late to political risks and to assume that the status quo will hold. The orthodox political thinking is still that National Front leader Marine Le Pen won<U+2019>t become France<U+2019>s next president. The polls instead favor Fran<U+00E7>ois Fillon, who won the center-right primary at the weekend, in a runoff against her. But already, the 10-year yield spread between France and Germany has reached more than 0.5 percentage point, its highest since early 2014. The spread started widening straight after the U.S. vote, and hasn<U+2019>t really stopped since. It isn<U+2019>t necessarily cause for particular alarm: Yields on 10-year French debt are still ultralow, at 0.76%. The last time the spread to Germany was at this level, the yield was north of 2%. But the widening is still noteworthy, as it goes against the trend of compression induced by the European Central Bank<U+2019>s government-bond purchases. Normally they would suppress volatility and hence keep spreads tight in the absence of a near-term catalyst. A similar development has occurred in Italy ahead of the country<U+2019>s Dec. 4 constitutional referendum . Here, a <U+201C>yes<U+201D> vote, which would allow Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to push ahead with reforms, would be the surprise. Like the French spread, the Italian 10-year spread against Germany has widened to levels not seen since early 2014. But investors are clearly jittery about the risks for Italian banks, whose balance sheets remain burdened with bad loans. The poster child is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena , whose shares dropped Monday as it launched a debt-for-equity swap, the first step in a broader recapitalization. But share prices for big Italian banks like UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo also fell by some 4% to 5%. In some ways, greater political awareness is a welcome development. Investors in developed markets have long appeared complacent in comparison with emerging markets, where there is often a political risk premium. But a greater focus on politics and a back seat for monetary policy also raise the risk of sharper moves in markets. The ECB warned last week of the potential for the repricing of risks to challenge financial stability . Markets that take more notice of the chance of outcomes that were previously dismissed as unrealistic will be more volatile. Write to Richard Barley at richard.barley@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Bank stocks have soared in the aftermath of Donald Trump <U+2019>s election victory. The sector overall is no longer cheap. But for a select few banks, there remains ample upside. From the day of the election through Monday<U+2019>s close, the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index has risen by 13.6%, compared with just 1.2% for the S&P 500. There are three main reasons: First and most important, rising interest rates will help banks earn more on loans. Second, surging market volatility will generate commissions for Wall Street trading desks. And finally, the new administration is expected to loosen the regulatory constraints placed on banks in the wake of the financial crisis. Higher rates provide a powerful boost to bank earnings, but the recent rise in yields looks priced in and then some. Bank of America , the most interest-rate-sensitive of the major banks, has surged 18% since the election, reaching levels not seen since 2008. And yet, the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note, at 2.22%, is still below where it ended last year, when the bank was priced 16 % below today<U+2019>s price. Trading activity is up but might not last given the long-term decline in volume. And regulatory changes are hard to predict. Mr. Trump could deregulate the whole sector or stick to his populist theme and stay tough on the biggest Wall Street banks . There is broad consensus though that midsize banks will benefit. At a minimum, Congress is likely to raise the threshold for mandatory annual stress-testing by the Federal Reserve to $250 billion in total assets, from $50 billion currently. That would allow these banks to return a lot more capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Four midsize lenders stand out for having especially high levels of capital that could be distributed to shareholders under a more permissive regime: Regions Financial , Citizens Financial , Zions Bancorp, and CIT Group . Zions, for instance, is currently returning around 70% to 80% of net income to shareholders, giving it room to distribute significantly more, says Brian Flanagan, senior equity portfolio manager at Thrivent Asset Management, which holds a substantial stake in the bank. These four lenders hold common-equity Tier 1 capital ratios ranging from 11.1% at Regions Financial to 13.7% at CIT Group, all above average for banks their size. With the exception of CIT, they are also among the most sensitive in their peer group to higher interest rates, according to KBW analyst Brian Klock. And all four still trade relatively cheaply, at below or close to book value. The big rally has wiped away much of the value in the sector. But these underappreciated midsize lenders still look cheap.",

        "original_post": "Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said Friday a rising tide of opposition to international trade and integration threatens global growth. <U+201C>There are very few countries which have succeeded in growing rapidly in a sustained period without integrating in the global economy, and that<U+2019>s the great fear I have about what<U+2019>s going on politically,<U+201D> he said in a discussion at the Institute of International Finance conference in Washington, D.C. Global trade this year will grow at the slowest pace since 2007 , according to the World Trade Organization. Finance ministers and central bankers from around the world gathered in Washington, D.C., this week for annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have pointed to rising antitrade sentiment as a major economic threat. Mr. Fischer echoed those fears in his remarks. <U+201C>What worries me about the antiglobalization [view] is the view that globalization is useless and we ought to be back and worry about ourselves,<U+201D> he said. Despite the political trends, <U+201C>the importance of trade as a growth machine<U+201D> hasn<U+2019>t declined, he added. In the U.S., Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has criticized trade deals he blames for sending jobs overseas. Growing opposition to trade also has put a congressional vote ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership on hold, to the frustration of the Obama administration , which considers it a key accomplishment. Mr. Fischer didn<U+2019>t specifically address the TPP or Mr. Trump<U+2019>s criticisms, but he suggested the current state of uncertainty has held back investment. <U+201C>You<U+2019>ve got a lot of firms sitting on a lot of cash, even firms sitting on cash in the United States,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s a sort of air of uncertainty about the situation that I think is not encouraging investment.<U+201D> Mr. Fischer didn't discuss monetary policy. The Fed has scheduled two more policy meetings before the end of the year, in November and in December. Analysts expect the Fed to raise interest rates in December. The Fed official also expressed satisfaction with Friday<U+2019>s employment report showing more workers coming off the sidelines and wages rising. <U+201C>Unemployment is very close to the natural rate,<U+201D> he said. On regulatory matters, Mr. Fischer defended the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, even though he said areas for improvement remain. <U+201C>The big goals of the reforms and regulation that took place in Dodd-Frank have been achieved in certain areas of the banking sector, and I worry a little bit about the fact that we in the United States do not have very good mechanisms for dealing with the nonbank sector, the shadow banking system,<U+201D> he said.

Gigante, which has office supplies and home goods stores, restaurants and real estate operations, said Office Depot de Mexico will pay all of the outstanding 6.875% notes due 2020 on Dec. 19. Gigante acquired the 50% of Office Depot de Mexico that it didn<U+2019>t own from joint-venture partner Office Depot Inc. in 2013. Taking advantage of currency hedges at 19.02 pesos per U.S. dollar, the unit will use cash from its operations, $200 million in capital from shareholders Grupo Gigante and Gigante Retail, as well as a 3 billion peso ($146 million) long-term loan from Mexican development bank Bancomext to cover the payment. <U+201C>In accordance with its strategic plan, Grupo Gigante is reducing by more than 98% its dollar-denominated liabilities, while Office Depot de Mexico converts its foreign currency debt into pesos, refinancing at a longer term and under better conditions,<U+201D> Gigante said in a filing with the Mexican stock exchange. The Mexican peso, already reeling from lower oil prices that cut into Mexican government revenue and the prospects of higher U.S. interest rates, hit new all-time lows against the dollar following the election of Donald Trump, who has said he would seek to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement under better terms for the U.S. The peso was trading in Mexico City on Friday around 20.5425 to the dollar. The uncertainty over the impact Mr. Trump<U+2019>s administration could have on trade and investment has led economists to lower growth estimates for Mexico, and this week prompted the central bank to raise interest rates for the fourth time this year. Gigante said it would continue to implement a cautious strategy <U+201C>careful of the new international environment.<U+201D> Gigante has a history of conservative debt management. In late 2007, it used proceeds from the sale of its supermarkets to buy back dollar debt, just months before the peso sank in the midst of the 2008 financial crisis. Many Mexican corporations have been in the habit of hedging their foreign currency exposure since that crisis, which caused several local companies to restructure debt as the peso depreciation caught them unprepared.

        "original_post": "One night, after the Democratic convention, I caught a train back to downtown Philadelphia. Some men boarded the train a few stops after me, shouting about Hillary Clinton. I took out my earphones to listen. <U+201C>She<U+2019>s a slut who belongs in jail,<U+201D> one of them said. At the time, I took that remark as a reminder of the sexism driving the antipathy for Mrs. Clinton among some voters. Now I see it as a harbinger of things to come. In a tweet on Tuesday, Sid Miller, an adviser to Donald Trump, called Hillary Clinton a sexist slur: Facing criticism, Mr. Miller<U+2019>s team claimed his account was hacked and then that the comment was a mistaken retweet. The comment appears to have been copied, but not retweeted, from a white supremacist account. This is only the latest time the slur has been lobbed at Mrs. Clinton by the Trump camp. Back in July, Scott Baio, who spoke at the Republican National Convention, tweeted a meme using the slur. The alt-right radio host Alex Jones has called her a <U+201C>bitch<U+201D> and a <U+201C>witch.<U+201D> Rush Limbaugh called her <U+201C>a witch with a capital B.<U+201D> Merchandise reading <U+201C>Trump That Bitch<U+201D> and <U+201C>Life<U+2019>s a Bitch; Don<U+2019>t Vote For One<U+201D> has shown up at Trump rallies. Mr. Trump himself, of course, called his opponent <U+201C>such a nasty woman<U+201D> during the third presidential debate. And while his boasts about grabbing women <U+201C>by the pussy<U+201D> took place before this campaign season, they<U+2019>ve added to a political environment in which grotesquely sexist language has become commonplace. This language is not shocking. Probably every woman in America has been called a slut, a bitch or worse. We have stood up for ourselves, we have talked back, we have moved on. In some cases, we have reclaimed these words as our own. But we have not forgotten. Every time one of Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s opponents speaks words like this, we remember the men who sought to humiliate us and to keep us silent. We remember the first time, when we learned the words that men would use to hurt us. We remember the last time, when we were surprised to find those words still hurt. Words can<U+2019>t stop us, but they matter and they do harm. I wasn<U+2019>t surprised to hear Hillary Clinton called a slut that night in July. I know I<U+2019>ll hear worse if she becomes president. I<U+2019>m prepared, but I wish I didn<U+2019>t have to be.

He said WikiLeaks planned to publish documents every week for the next 10 weeks. The publications, he said, would relate to the U.S. election, Google, war, arms and oil. The first publication will come this week, Mr. Assange said, but he declined to say whether it would be related to the U.S. election. <U+201C>I would like to keep that ambiguity, but we have quite a pace ahead of us,<U+201D> Mr. Assange said.

        "original_post": "A running question through the presidential race has been whether Hillary Clinton is sincere in saying she opposes the 12-nation Asian trade deal that is one of the Obama administration<U+2019>s top overseas priorities. As secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton praised the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, calling it the <U+201C>gold standard<U+201D> of trade deals. But that was before she jumped into the presidential race. Organized labor, liberal activists and others want to scuttle TPP, so if Mrs. Clinton remained supportive, she risked a political backlash. On Oct. 8, 2015, Mrs. Clinton said she opposed the trade pact , a position that proved helpful in keeping her coalition intact and beating back a primary challenge from Vermont<U+2019>s liberal senator, Bernie Sanders. That wasn<U+2019>t an easy call. A new batch of hacked emails illustrates divisions within her staff about how to handle one of the most delicate issues of the race. Five days before Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s announcement, her top advisers were divided about what she should do, with some fearing that opposition to the trade pact would look like a blatant <U+201C>flip-flop.<U+201D> The emails were posted Thursday by the antisecrecy group WikiLeaks. U.S. officials believe that Russian intelligence agents hacked into Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta <U+2019>s account and stole the emails, giving them to WikiLeaks to disrupt the U.S. presidential race. The Clinton campaign has declined to confirm or deny the authenticity of specific emails. Jake Sullivan, a senior Clinton adviser, said Thursday: <U+201C>There is no longer any doubt that [Russian President Vladimir Putin ] is trying to help Donald Trump by weaponizing WikiLeaks.<U+201D> In an email exchange Oct. 3, 2015, Ron Klain, who has helped Mrs. Clinton prepare for debates, wrote a note saying, <U+201C>She has to be for TPP.<U+201D> Mr. Klain added: <U+201C>I think opposing that would be a huge flip-flop. She can say that as President she would work to change it. She can say that it can be better. But I think she should support it.<U+201D> That produced a reply from Mr. Sullivan: <U+201D>I agree with you on TPP but others (including on this email!) feel strongly to the contrary.<U+201D> The exchange ends with campaign manager Robby Mook noting that labor wouldn<U+2019>t stand for her endorsing the trade deal. <U+201C>TPP would be lethal with labor. We<U+2019>d loose [sic] Afscme and likely SEIU as well.<U+201D> That calculation apparently carried the day. Mrs. Clinton talked about the trade deal during the debate Wednesday in Las Vegas with her Republican rival, Mr. Trump. <U+201C>Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it,<U+201D> Mrs. Clinton said. <U+201C>It didn<U+2019>t meet my test. I<U+2019>ve had the same test. Does it create jobs, raise incomes and further our national security? I<U+2019>m against it now. I<U+2019>ll be against it after the election. I<U+2019>ll be against it when I<U+2019>m president.\" Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "WASHINGTON<U+2014>Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein on Tuesday paid the Wisconsin Elections Commission the required $3.5 million to initiate a statewide recount, paving the way for an effort to re-examine vote totals across the state, the commission said. Citing higher-than-expected expenses, Ms. Stein<U+2019>s campaign said it would be asking for an additional $2.4 million from donors to support recount efforts in three states , including Wisconsin , bringing total estimated costs to $9.5 million. The new amount represents the second time that Ms. Stein has increased the amount of money she said will be required for the audits. She originally sought $2.5 million. <U+201C>We will be alerting recount advocates that we must now raise an additional $2.4 million to cover this new extraordinary burden in Wisconsin,<U+201D> Ms. Stein said. Ms. Stein<U+2019>s campaign initiated recount efforts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania last week after a prominent computer scientist raised hypothetical concerns about the possibility that voting machines were hacked. Though no evidence exists of any hack, a group of election lawyers and computer scientists encouraged recounts and forensic examinations to conclusively show that the November elections were free of interference. Having successfully filed and paid for a Wisconsin recount, Ms. Stein plans to do the same in Michigan on Wednesday. Her campaign hit a major roadblock in Pennsylvania, where supporters filed for recounts covering only a fraction of the state. State law requires three voters in each election district to file a complaint. The only way for a full recount in Pennsylvania now involves a lawsuit in state court, something the effort<U+2019>s lawyer acknowledged is an uphill battle. A judge on Monday will hear arguments in a case brought by dozens of Pennsylvania voters who argue that the election was conducted illegally. Republicans on Capitol Hill in Washington dismissed the recount effort, which Ms. Stein insists isn<U+2019>t aimed at swinging the election results. <U+201C>I think it is sad to see the Green Party and the Democratic Party acting like sore losers. We had an election. It was decided fair and square. And the American people overwhelmingly voted to elect Donald Trump the next president,<U+201D> said Sen.

        "original_post": "Bank shares surged Monday, reflecting expectations that a victory Tuesday by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton would keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index of large U.S. commercial lenders gained 2.8%, outpacing the 2.2% rise in the S&P 500. Morgan Stanley climbed $1.22, or 3.7%, to $34, Citigroup Inc. added $1.65, or 3.4%, to $49.82, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. rose $5.56, or 3.2%, to $181.48. The rally got its impetus from the announcement on Sunday by Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey that no prosecution of Mrs. Clinton was justified in the discovery of classified information on her private email server. Many investors say a win for Mrs. Clinton would maintain relative calm in markets, leaving the Fed on track to raise rates at its next meeting in December. Higher rates are typically good for banks, boosting the gap between what lenders pay on deposits and make on loans. Federal-funds futures showed a 76% chance of an interest-rate rise in December, up from 67% the previous session, according to CME Group. A wave of selling swept the U.S. government bond market Monday, sending the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to 1.826% from 1.783% Friday. Yields rise as bond prices fall. Yields dropped last week as investors sought relatively safe assets. <U+201C>If you have a known outcome, yields should go up slightly, and that<U+2019>s going to benefit the banks,<U+201D> said Michael Mattioli, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management. <U+2014>Min Zeng contributed to this article.

        "original_post": "A video posted on Monday by a British newspaper appeared to show a Republican consultant with ties to Donald J. Trump offering to disguise the source of contributions to a <U+201C> super PAC <U+201D> intended to aid Mr. Trump<U+2019>s presidential campaign. In an accompanying article , the newspaper, The Telegraph, wrote that two of its reporters, posing as representatives of a Chinese national who supported Mr. Trump as the Republican presidential nominee, had proposed making a $2 million contribution in support of him. According to the newspaper, the G.O.P. consultant, Jesse Benton, had proposed routing the contribution through his own public relations firm and into nonprofit groups that do not disclose their donors, disguising the foreign source. The groups would then make the contribution to the super PAC, known as Great America PAC, or spend it to benefit Mr. Trump. United States law strictly forbids foreign nationals from making contributions to candidates, political parties or PACs. And Mr. Benton has a checkered history: Last month he was sentenced to two years of probation for his role in a 2012 scheme to make secret payments to an Iowa state senator in exchange for an endorsement. But the video does not show how the reporters identified themselves and reflects only snippets of the reporters<U+2019> conversations with Mr. Benton, making it difficult to verify exactly what Mr. Benton had offered or whether any laws were broken. Mr. Benton stopped formally working for the super PAC last spring, after his conviction in the endorsement-buying scheme. Dan Backer, a lawyer for Great America, suggested that Mr. Benton had exaggerated his ties to the super PAC and said that Mr. Benton had no authority to solicit contributions. <U+201C>I think it<U+2019>s pretty clear that someone who used to work for the organization decided to leverage that former relationship for his own purposes,<U+201D> Mr. Backer said. <U+201C>We did not take, we did not solicit, we did not accept any foreign contributions directly or indirectly.<U+201D> Mr. Backer acknowledged that the undercover reporters first contacted Eric Beach, the PAC<U+2019>s co-chairman, who referred them to Mr. Benton. But Mr. Backer said it was for Mr. Benton to advise the supposed donors on legal activities they could conduct in the United States. In the video, shot during a meeting at a New York hotel, Mr. Benton can be seen saying, <U+201C>I<U+2019>ll send money from my company to both.<U+201D> The video then cuts to another shot, with Mr. Benton agreeing that money would move from his firm into a nonprofit. In neither case does the video show the full exchange.

Both of those events went head-to-head with National Football League games, while Wednesday<U+2019>s debate at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas did not.

Richard Burr (R., N.C.) has won his bid for re-election, defeating lawyer and former state legislator Deborah Ross in a race that was surprisingly close and illustrated the changing politics and demographics of North Carolina. The two-term incumbent retained his seat with 51% of the vote, compared with Ms. Ross<U+2019>s 45.6%, with 72% of precincts reporting when the Associated Press called the race. The close margin reflected the degree to which Mr. Burr, 60 years old, had to fight back against an unexpectedly strong challenge from Ms. Ross, 53, who wasn<U+2019>t even her party<U+2019>s first choice for the seat. He did it with prodigious fundraising and careful positioning of his candidacy in relation to his party<U+2019>s presidential candidate, Donald Trump. He supported Mr. Trump but kept his distance from the celebrity businessman on the campaign trail. Mr. Burr, a policy-oriented chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said during the campaign that he wasn<U+2019>t <U+201C>on anyone<U+2019>s coattails,<U+201D> despite efforts by Ms. Ross to connect the two. Mr. Burr, who served 10 years in the House before winning his Senate seat in 2004, won re-election handily in 2010. Some Republicans were concerned that he waited until August to begin running ads in a state that became a battleground at all levels in 2016. But Mr. Burr has built a reputation for constituent service, and he made the case that Ms. Ross, a former state legislator and former head of the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, was too liberal for North Carolina. The Republican Party has been dominant in North Carolina for years, but its political landscape has been changing with an influx of new voters brought in with the expansion of banking and other industries in the state, making it one of the most closely divided battlegrounds in the nation.",

        "original_post": "Donald Trump <U+2019>s election has lifted insurers stuck in the low-interest-rate swamp <U+2014>with one glaring exception. It<U+2019>s worth a second look. Unlike nearly all its global peers, Asian insurance giant AIA Group has taken a share-price hit since the Trumpflation trade came into effect two weeks ago. Its former parent AIG is up 8%. Rival Prudential of the U.K. is up 13%; Canadian insurer Manulife . 19%. Some Japanese and Chinese peers have rallied even harder. By contrast, AIA has been down as much as 4%. There is reason for AIA to worry, but perhaps not so much. Its substantial businesses in Asian countries whose currencies have fallen will ding earnings, which are reported in U.S. dollars<U+2014>but those are mostly translation effects. Most of its local businesses are currency-matched or hedged. Rising interest rates could mean paper losses on its bond portfolio, but it holds these securities to maturity, so the losses will be recovered unless there are wide-scale surrenders. AIA is more sensitive to rising rates because its liabilities are heavy on the long end. Almost 90% have a duration of 10 years or more, compared with only 40% of its assets, according to Sanford C. Bernstein<U+2019>s Linda Sun-Mattison. Part of the reason is that while it sells long-term products, bond markets in Asia<U+2014>where its earnings come from<U+2014>are shallow. The saving grace: Only a third of its earnings come from the so-called spread book. But there are also reasons the strong dollar should help. Approximately 40% of AIA<U+2019>s assets are exposed to dollars, which means that a rise of 0.5 percentage point in U.S. rates could add 2% to the insurer<U+2019>s embedded value, according to Ms. Sun-Mattison. In AIA<U+2019>s Hong Kong business, which accounts for a third of operating profit, 90% of policies are matched in U.S. dollars. And at the group level, 90% of working capital is invested in U.S.-dollar assets. AIA generates plenty of free surplus; excluding changes in investment returns, it was up 12% from a year earlier in the six months ended May. That should keep the company<U+2019>s dividend safe. At 1.8 times forecast book value, AIA is higher-valued than peers thanks to its growth, but it is trading below its own long-term average and is at its lowest in six months. AIA got left behind in the postelection upswing. But it should be in for a boost eventually. Write to Anjani Trivedi at anjani.trivedi@wsj.com",

That<U+2019>s why I have urged everyone who sees him for what he is to do what they can over the next five days to prevent his victory. But you should also do so optimistically. As Jim Messina, President Obama<U+2019>s 2012 campaign manager, notes in an Op-Ed this morning, the tightening national polls don<U+2019>t deserve as much attention as they get. <U+201C>The best campaigns don<U+2019>t bother with national polls,<U+201D> he writes. Far more relevant are state polls (particularly state polls that use the most sophisticated methodologies, taking advantage of voter files, for example). And state polls continue to look strong for Hillary Clinton. Clinton leads by at least six percentage points in a group of states that would give her 263 electoral votes, seven shy of victory. She leads by fewer than six points in another four states that combine for 59 electoral votes. To win, Trump would need a sweep of every state he leads (including Ohio and Iowa), as well as some where Clinton leads, like Florida, North Carolina and either Colorado or New Hampshire. In a few of these states, like Colorado, the early vote is encouraging for Clinton. As I<U+2019>ve mentioned before, through all of the campaign<U+2019>s ups and downs, Clinton has never trailed, whether you look at state polling or national polling averages. Most of the poll fluctuations stem from people<U+2019>s waxing and waning enthusiasm about responding to polls, based on the news surrounding their preferred candidate. So breathe deeply.

        "original_post": "Illinois Rep. Tammy Duckworth, an Asian American and disabled veteran of the Iraq War, ousted Republican Sen. Mark Kirk on Tuesday, after a contentious battle that left the centrist incumbent on the defensive for much of the campaign. Ms. Duckworth won with 66.3% percent of the vote, compared with 28.9% for Mr. Kirk when the Associated Press called the race with 20% of precincts reporting. Elected to the House in 2012, Ms. Duckworth previously worked as an assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and before that was the head of veterans affairs for the state of Illinois. While in Iraq in 2004, she lost both her legs when the Black Hawk helicopter she was piloting was shot down. Mr. Kirk was elected in 2010 as part of a GOP wave that added to the party<U+2019>s strength and helped it win control of the Senate in 2014. But in the year of Donald Trump, that wave receded and left Mr. Kirk exposed. The centrist Mr. Kirk, also a veteran, often emphasized his distance from the party establishment. He called for a vote on President Barack Obama <U+2019>s nominee for the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland, for example, despite the Senate GOP leadership<U+2019>s insistence on waiting until the next president is chosen. A former five-term congressman from the Chicago suburbs, he supports gun control. But Ms. Duckworth was able to find ways to connect him to his party, noting most prominently his stances on trade. He voted to give the White House <U+201C>fast track<U+201D> authority for the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal in 2015, for example. The incumbent<U+2019>s fate was probably sealed in the final weeks of the campaign when he sarcastically brought up Ms. Duckworth<U+2019>s heritage<U+2014>her mother came to the U.S. from Thailand<U+2014>during a debate on Oct. 27. Referring to her service and that of her father, a captain in the Army, she said she was a daughter of the American Revolution, to which Mr. Kirk replied, <U+201C>I forgot that your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington.<U+201D> Ms. Duckworth said nothing in response, and the audience went silent. The debate went on to the next question. But the comments set off a barrage of criticism from people in both parties who said Mr. Kirk had crossed a line. She will occupy the seat held by Barack Obama before he became president.",

        "original_post": "WASHINGTON <U+2014> President-elect Donald J. Trump is expected to select as commerce secretary Wilbur Ross , a billionaire investor who became known as the <U+201C>king of bankruptcy<U+201D> for buying, restructuring and selling off steel makers and other fading industrial companies, officials on the transition team said on Thursday. After choosing national security hard-liners for some of his earliest appointments, Mr. Trump is now turning to a group of ultrawealthy conservatives to help steer administration policy. In addition to Mr. Ross, a generous contributor to his campaign, Mr. Trump is likely to choose Todd Ricketts, a Republican megadonor who is an owner of the Chicago Cubs and whose father founded TD Ameritrade, to be the deputy commerce secretary, the officials said. And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he would name Betsy DeVos , a school choice activist and Republican fund-raiser, as his education secretary. Mr. Ross, 78, an economic adviser to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign whose fortune is estimated by Forbes to be $2.9 billion, is aligned with Mr. Trump on trade. He says the United States must free itself from the <U+201C>bondage<U+201D> of <U+201C>bad trade agreements,<U+201D> and he has advocated threats of steep tariffs on Chinese goods. Mr. Ross, the chairman of the private equity firm WL Ross & Company, has also pressed for cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, from 35 percent, and reducing taxes and regulations on energy companies. During the general election, he hosted at least one fund-raiser for Mr. Trump at his home in the Hamptons. There, Mr. Trump, who at the time was pondering his choice for a running mate, turned his deliberations into a party game, soliciting opinions from the donors in attendance. Mr. Ross also owns a waterfront estate in Palm Beach, Fla., down the road from Mar-a-Lago , Mr. Trump<U+2019>s club, which is expected to be his White House getaway, and where the president-elect was spending Thanksgiving with his family. If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Ross would succeed another wealthy campaign donor at the helm of an agency charged with promoting American commercial interests and trade around the world. Penny Pritzker , President Obama<U+2019>s commerce secretary, is a billionaire entrepreneur who was an early financial backer of Mr. Obama and is an heiress to the Hyatt Hotels fortune. Unlike Mr. Trump and Mr. Ross, Ms. Pritzker has been a leading proponent of forging new free-trade agreements. One of her top priorities was the completion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a sweeping 12-nation accord that Mr. Trump has promised to scrap. Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.

        "original_post": "One area of investing has reacted badly to Donald Trump <U+2019>s U.S. election victory: Emerging markets and the fund managers that serve them, such as Aberdeen Asset Management . The potential toxic mix of higher U.S. interest rates and protectionist measures to restrict trade between the U.S. and other markets has hit emerging market equities and debt. That amplified existing concerns about the pain from tighter U.S. monetary policy. For listed asset managers, the latest slide began in October. Since then, Aberdeen shares are down 18%, and those of rival Ashmore Group, which is even more emerging market focused , are down 21%. However, Aberdeen<U+2019>s results for its fiscal year ended Sept. 30 had some positives. Net outflows from equities funds, which produce the highest fees, slowed throughout the year . Emerging market bonds, however, remain unloved by investors, the company said. The outlook isn<U+2019>t improving. In recent weeks, equity outflows continued while inflows have stopped as investors wait to see what President-elect Trump will actually do, Aberdeen said. But while Trump has hindered, Brexit has helped: the fall in sterling since the summer drove a 10% increase in assets under management for Aberdeen as net outflows and market performance canceled each other out over the year. Ultimately, however, Aberdeen<U+2019>s operating margins were down by almost one quarter compared with 2015 and pretax profit fell 37%. Martin Gilbert, Aberdeen chief executive, reckons that if Mr. Trump does cut taxes quickly and the U.S. starts to boom, then it will likely suck in imports from emerging markets, especially raw materials. Investors who are positive on the U.S. should then see a buying opportunity in emerging markets. Unfortunately for groups like Aberdeen and Ashmore, investors aren<U+2019>t looking at all tempted by that theory right now. Write to Paul J. Davies at paul.davies@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "WASHINGTON<U+2014>Two senior U.S. intelligence officials reiterated Thursday their belief that the Russian government stole and then leaked emails in an effort to interfere with the November elections, countering the repeated insistence from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that no one knows who carried out the attacks. Adm. Michael Rogers, director of the National Security Agency, said at a conference in Baltimore that <U+201C>we have acknowledged that the Russians were behind the penetrations,<U+201D> referring to hacks carried out against the Democratic National Committee, some of its affiliates and Clinton campaign aides. <U+201C>We need to step back as a nation and think about what are the implications of that?<U+201D> Adm. Rogers said. <U+201C>Is that something we are comfortable with?<U+201D> Earlier this month, the U.S. intelligence community issued a joint statement accusing senior Russian leaders of carrying out an operation that has stolen computer files and then leaked more than 40,000 emails and other documents through three entities, including WikiLeaks. Russian officials at first denied any involvement, but recently their statements have evolved to say it is irrelevant who carried out the hacks, as long as the information was made public in a way that informs American voters about the inner workings of the political process. Republican vice-presidential nominee Mike Pence and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) have both agreed that it appears Russia is behind the operation. But Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that it is unclear who carried out the thefts. In Wednesday<U+2019>s presidential debate, Mr. Trump objected when Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton said 17 U.S. intelligence agencies have attributed the hacks to Moscow. <U+201C>She has no idea whether it<U+2019>s Russia, China or anybody else,<U+201D> Mr. Trump said. He added, <U+201C>Our country has no idea.<U+201D> Adm. Rogers wasn<U+2019>t the only official to refute that assertion Thursday. Speaking in Washington, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper wouldn<U+2019>t reveal why U.S. officials have such a high degree of confidence that Russian officials are behind the hacking, but he said their certainty was unwavering. <U+201C>I am not going to discuss the underlying evidentiary basis for it,<U+201D> Mr. Clapper said. <U+201C>When we say we are confident, I think it speaks for itself.<U+201D> U.S. intelligence officials say they based their conclusion on digital forensics and the fact that the way the information was leaked closely mirrors the way Russia has tried to interfere in elections in Europe. The White House has said the U.S. will respond to the apparent Russian operation in a way that is <U+201C>proportional.<U+201D> Officials have declined to say whether that would consist of a cyberattack, new economic sanctions, diplomatic curbs or some other action. Russia<U+2019>s role in the U.S. election was a heated issue in Wednesday<U+2019>s debate . Mrs. Clinton accused Mr. Trump of being a <U+201C>puppet<U+201D> of Russian President Vladimir Putin. <U+201C>No puppet,<U+201D> Mr. Trump shot back at Mrs. Clinton. <U+201C>You<U+2019>re the puppet.<U+201D> Write to Damian Paletta at damian.paletta@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "National Security Agency Director Adm. Michael Rogers is the leading candidate to become President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s next Director of National Intelligence, two people familiar with the matter said, a move that would shift the nation<U+2019>s digital and cyberwarfare leader to the country<U+2019>s most senior spy post. Adm. Rogers has led the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command since 2014. He was brought in following a backlash to revelations in 2013 that the NSA was sweeping up bulk telephone records on millions of Americans. He has pursued public outreach efforts since then to soften the NSA<U+2019>s image, though he still leads teams that conduct many classified surveillance, spying, and cyberwarfare operations. The NSA director met with Mr. Trump at Trump Tower in New York on Thursday. Adm. Rogers<U+2019>s appointment as director of national intelligence could add a complication to the Trump administration, in which the president-elect wants to pursue closer relations to Russia , but where part of the national security establishment is suspicious of Moscow<U+2019>s intentions. Earlier this week, Adm. Rogers repeated the U.S. intelligence community<U+2019>s conclusions that Moscow sought to tamper with U.S. elections by hacking into mailboxes of the Democratic National Committee and dumping their contents in the weeks before voting. <U+201C>This was not something that was done by chance, this was not a target that was selected purely arbitrarily,<U+201D> he said in a question-and-answer session at a conference in Washington. <U+201C>This was a conscious effort by a nation state to attempt to achieve a specific effect.<U+201D> Adm. Rogers didn't offer a remedy to the problem with Russia, but he said that countermeasures, including some outside the sphere of cyber, had been effective dealing with other intrusions from foreign lands. <U+201C>We<U+2019>ve also been very public as a government in saying, <U+2018>look, this is just unacceptable ,<U+2019> <U+201D> he said. <U+201C>We don<U+2019>t support this, this is outside the norms of acceptable behavior and we<U+2019>re not prepared to accept this.<U+201D> The Office of Director of National Intelligence is an umbrella intelligence department created following the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks , charged with ensuring the country<U+2019>s 17 spy agencies are sharing information to form the most comprehensive assessment possible of various threats.

        "original_post": "This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. First, I encourage you to check our Opinion report frequently throughout the day. Our Op-Ed columnists and contributors will be writing all day about the results. Now, let me tell you how I plan to watch election night: I start the night believing that the polls are correct and that Hillary Clinton is poised to win by roughly the same comfortable Electoral College margin as President Obama did in 2012. All night, I<U+2019>ll be looking for ( and worried about ) signs that the polls are wrong. For starters, I<U+2019>ll be checking the prediction markets at PredictWise pretty frequently. Donald Trump starts the day with an 11 percent chance of victory. If that starts to change, it means bettors are seeing signs <U+2014> such as exit polls or turnout numbers <U+2014> that they consider meaningful. Once polls start closing, I<U+2019>ll largely ignore Virginia (where polls close at 7 p.m., and all times here are Eastern) at first, because it counts votes slowly and Democrats always trail early. Instead, I<U+2019>ll look to Florida (8 p.m.) and North Carolina (7:30 p.m.). They both had a lot of early voting, which means they can report results quickly. Trump needs Florida if not both states. Next, I<U+2019>ll turn to the states Clinton should be winning, like Pennsylvania (8 p.m.), Michigan (polls start closing at 8 p.m.) , Wisconsin (9 p.m.), Colorado (9 p.m.), Nevada (10 p.m.). The most plausible razor-thin Clinton victory has her winning all of those as well as Virginia (while losing New Hampshire, Florida, Ohio and North Carolina).

        "original_post": "White, working-class voters have been on the decline in Ohio. They made up 45% of the state<U+2019>s electorate in 2012, exit polls showed, and 43%<U+00A0>on Tuesday. But they helped deliver the state for Republican Donald Trump that Mitt Romney lost four years ago. That was because Mr. Trump boosted his party<U+2019>s margins among white voters, particularly working-class whites. Mr. Trump won white voters in Ohio without a four-year college degree by 27 percentage points, taking 62% of their votes. Mr. Romney won this group in 2012, but by 14 points. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s success offers evidence to support a view long controversial among Republicans<U+2014>that the party can win by pumping up turnout among its largely white base, rather than adopting policies on immigration or other matters that might draw in more minority voters. The share of white voters continued its long-term fall, dropping from 72% of all voters in 2012 to 70% this year. Exit-poll results show how Mr. Trump was able to pump up his totals among this shrinking group. In Florida, for instance, whites made up 62% of the electorate, down from 67% in 2012. But while Mr. Romney won 61% of their votes in 2012, Mr. Trump took 64%. That was enough to flip the state into his column. Similar shifts took place across the upper Midwest<U+2014>in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio<U+2014>as well as in Pennsylvania. Michigan remains too close to call, but Mr. Trump moved the other states into the GOP column. Hillary Clinton was able to make up for some of those losses with better performance than Barack Obama among college-educated white voters. But she was toppled by the working-class vote. <U+201C>What completely broke the machine was these massive shifts among white, noncollege voters,<U+201C> said Ruy Teixeira, a senior fellow at the Democratic-leaning Center for American Progress, who has studied this voting bloc. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s the real story.<U+201D> For some, it is a validation of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign message, which focused heavily on the idea that illegal immigration and free-trade deals had sapped jobs that should belong to struggling Americans. Others worry that eventually there won<U+2019>t be enough working-class white voters to deliver this sort of victory. <U+201C>At some point that strategy is going to catch up with us,<U+201D> said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster who advocates a broader appeal. <U+201C>He managed to slip by one more election without it, but there is no doubt<U+2026>that the proportion of whites in the national electorate is still declining and will continue to do so.<U+201D> Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Congratulations to Chuck Schumer on his election Wednesday as the new Senate Minority Leader, which for the next two years makes him America<U+2019>s most powerful Democrat. Along with that honor comes the privilege of negotiating a path between Donald Trump and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Senate Republicans are welcoming Mr. Schumer, and not only because they<U+2019>re glad to see the last of Harry Reid. Mr. Schumer, a voluble New Yorker and career pol, is a partisan but he<U+2019>s also a deal-maker. In 2013 he threw himself into immigration reform and helped get the Gang of Eight bill through the Senate, though it failed in the House. In the current Congress he<U+2019>s tried to cut a deal with House Speaker Paul Ryan trading corporate tax reform for money for public works. The Obama Treasury blocked progress. Mr. Schumer<U+2019>s main problem in the next Congress will be his left Senate flank, in particular Ms. Warren. The Massachusetts progressive is already mapping out a no compromise, filibuster everything strategy against the GOP agenda. The Senate Democratic caucus is dominated by the left, so most of the 48 members of the minority will be on her side. Their strategy will be to block as much legislation as they can in order to deny the GOP accomplishments in the hope that this motivates Democratic voters in the 2018 midterms. The New Yorker<U+2019>s challenge is that Democrats have to defend 25 Senate seats in 2018, 10 of them in states that Mr. Trump carried last week. The potentially vulnerable incumbents who may seek re-election include Jon Tester (Montana), Joe Manchin (West Virginia), Heidi Heitkamp (North Dakota), Joe Donnelly (Indiana) and Claire McCaskill (Missouri). Those Senators will have a greater incentive than the Warren wing to cooperate with Mr. Trump on at least some issues. The wild card may be how well Mr. Trump, the art-of-the-deal man, can get along with Mr. Schumer. As New Yorkers, they<U+2019>ve known each other for years. As Minority Leader, Mr. Schumer<U+2019>s main goal will be getting back into the majority, which probably means minimizing losses in 2018 to fight in 2020 when Democrats will defend fewer seats. We doubt total obstruction helps with that.",

        "original_post": "FRANKFURT<U+2014>A top German central-bank official has waded into a clash between U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May and Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney over ultralow interest rates, calling on politicians to stay out of monetary policy decisions. The comments, in a speech in London, represent an unusually public rebuke to a foreign government from Germany<U+2019>s Bundesbank, which has long prided itself on its independence from political influence. Andreas Dombret, who sits on the Bundesbank<U+2019>s executive board, warned in a speech to the British Bankers' Association that political influence over central banks <U+201C>always leads into disorder.<U+201D> Mr. Dombret pointed to recent criticism of central banks by politicians, specifically over <U+201C>the handling of Brexit as well as conducting monetary policy and setting interest rates more generally.<U+201D> <U+201C>In light of this criticism, it may be time for a friendly reminder that central bank independence is not debatable,<U+201D> Mr. Dombret said. The Bank of England cut its main interest rate to 0.25% in August and launched a new <U+00A3>60 billion government-bond purchase program in an effort to shore up the U.K. economy following Britain<U+2019>s vote to leave the European Union. Mrs. May appeared to criticize the central bank<U+2019>s decisions earlier this month, arguing at a party conference that emergency measures such as superlow interest rates and bond purchases had caused <U+201C>some bad side effects.<U+201D> She said those policies would have to change <U+201C>and we are going to deliver it.<U+201D> But Mr. Dombret argued that allowing central banks to operate independently was the best guarantee against excessive inflation. <U+201C>Calling central bank independence into question, even only implicitly, can confuse markets as well as the public about who is in charge when it comes to monetary policy and supervisory decisions,<U+201D> Mr. Dombret said. Mr. Carney has stressed recently that the Bank of England is <U+201C> not going to take instruction on our policies from the political side .<U+201D> And on Wednesday, the U.K. government appeared to backtrack. U.K. Treasury Chief Philip Hammond said it has no plans to change the independence of the Bank of England . The Bundesbank has a proud history of clashes with politicians. Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann has repeatedly criticized eurozone governments, particularly Italy<U+2019>s, for seeking to loosen the bloc<U+2019>s deficit rules, which the German central bank worries could undermine the European Central Bank<U+2019>s ability to keep inflation in check. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has hit back, accusing Mr. Weidmann of improperly intervening in domestic politics. In the U.S., Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has also criticized Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen for keeping rates <U+201C>artificially low.<U+201D> Mr. Dombret, who was born in the U.S. to German parents, urged politicians <U+201C>not to exert influence in the wrong place or with the wrong measures.<U+201D> <U+201C>As Barack Obama recently said: <U+2018>A nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself,<U+2019><U+201D> Mr. Dombret said.

But what comes after ObamaCare? <U+201C>Deregulating and devolving power to states and consumers to innovate and experiment would allow insurance products and prices to reflect what consumers want,<U+201D> notes a Journal editorial . Lawmakers should now approach the debate <U+201C>with humility and build a stable and durable political consensus. Democrats never even tried this in 2009 and 2010, and they imposed a single <U+2018>comprehensive<U+2019> solution on a large and diverse country of 320 million people.

Speaking of California, Mrs. Clinton <U+2019>s advantage of 2.7 million votes in that state alone <U+201C>accounts for more than her projected margin of victory of about two million<U+201D> in the nationwide popular vote, observes a separate editorial . But <U+201C>the Electoral College, for all its imperfections, is still a better way to choose a President,<U+201D> writes the editorial board . ... Larry Arnn adds that the Electoral College ensures Americans <U+201C>are not ruled as colonies from a bunch of blue capitals, nor from a bunch of red ones.<U+201D> As for why Mrs. Clinton couldn<U+2019>t win enough states this year, our columnist William McGurn traces the Democratic failure to the Monica Lewinsky scandal of the 1990s. That<U+2019>s when Bill Clinton turned left as moderate Democrats criticized him and liberals came to his defense. Since then, the party has continued its leftward drift . <U+201C>What marks this year<U+2019>s Democratic primary was how antediluvian it all was: a battle between Mrs. Clinton and an aging socialist, each trying to outdo the other in how much he\/she would tax, spend and redistribute,<U+201D> writes Mr. McGurn . Former Reagan economic adviser Martin Feldstein surveys the huge reform opportunities in economic policy that await the President-elect. These include tax cuts and tax simplification to drive investment and economic growth. Also, although <U+201C>ending Nafta would be a mistake, trade experts agree that Nafta would benefit from being updated to reflect changes in the economy that have occurred in the past 22 years,<U+201D> writes Mr. Feldstein . <U+201C>The European Union greeted Donald Trump<U+2019>s election with gnashing of teeth and a typically chaotic <U+2018>emergency summit<U+2019> in Brussels over the weekend,<U+201D> notes a Journal editorial . <U+201C>Europeans like to lecture Americans about their political choices even as Americans always seem to be coming to Europe<U+2019>s rescue. Before panicking about Mr. Trump, perhaps Europe<U+2019>s leaders should meet him .<U+201D> Also today, MIT<U+2019>s Robert Pozen says that his colleague Bengt Holmstrom, who is due to accept a Nobel Prize in economics next month, has come up with a better way to ensure stock-option awards align the interests of shareholders and CEOs .",

        "original_post": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was slow to endorse Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton last year, drawing criticism from her aides and bewilderment from some of his own . But he was also working with her campaign during this time. According to leaked emails released Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio briefed Clinton campaign officials about a meeting with Sen. Bernie Sanders and worked with them on talking points for television appearances. <U+201C>My message to him (saying this in confidence to you) is that I will always want to work with him in the future and will never have a bad word about him, but won<U+2019>t be supporting him in this campaign,<U+201D> Mr. de Blasio said to Clinton campaign manager John Podesta in September 2015, ahead of a meeting between the mayor and the Vermont senator. Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat who managed Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s 2000 Senate campaign, publicly said he hadn<U+2019>t made up his mind until he endorsed Mrs. Clinton for president in late October 2015. He declined to endorse Mrs. Clinton on many occasions, including during an appearance on NBC<U+2019>s <U+201C>Meet the Press<U+201D> a day after she announced she was running. A spokesman for Mr. de Blasio declined to comment on the emails, posted by the website WikiLeaks . A Clinton spokesman said: <U+201C>By dribbling these out every day, WikiLeaks is proving they are nothing but a propaganda arm of the Kremlin with a political agenda doing Putin<U+2019>s dirty work to help elect Donald Trump. <U+201D> Mr. Podesta said earlier this week that he had been in contact with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, calling the leak a <U+201C>criminal hack.<U+201D> Mr. de Blasio told the Clinton campaign how he would praise Mrs. Clinton on TV. <U+201C>If asked what<U+2019>s holding me up on Hillary, I<U+2019>ll allude to the Progressive Agenda and a few areas where I<U+2019>m seeking clarification,<U+201D> he said, a reference to a nonprofit designed by de Blasio allies focused on issues such as income inequality. Before he endorsed Mrs. Clinton, Mr. de Blasio tried to persuade both her and Mr. Sanders to attend his Progressive Agenda presidential forum in Iowa. <U+201C>I quietly first want to see what date works for you guys before locking anything down,<U+201D> he said to Mr. Podesta. Neither candidate agreed to attend, and the event was canceled . Mr. de Blasio gave Mr. Podesta advice about Mrs. Clinton and her debate performance in March. <U+201C>Hillary was fantastic on the gun control answer, then totally blew the mass incarceration question. Why on Earth did she say <U+2018>Are you going to ask Senator Sanders that question?<U+2019> instead of just addressing the issue. When she makes it about her, she loses the high ground. Stating the obvious, I know, but she keeps doing it,<U+201D> he said in an email to Mr. Podesta. Mr. de Blasio asked Clinton aides to give him more access to Mrs. Clinton but seemed to be rebuffed. At the Democratic National Convention, he was given an afternoon speaking slot. In one email to another Clinton aide, Mr. Podesta jokes: <U+201C>Bill de Blasio for president!!<U+201D> Write to Josh Dawsey at JOSHUA.DAWSEY@dowjones.com",

At a press conference, Ms. Moskowitz, founder of Success Academy Charter Schools, said she instead wanted to focus on her charter network. She added that while she voted for Hillary Clinton, she would support President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s push for school choice and would work with his team to promote it. She declined to say whether she had been offered the position. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s son-in-law Jared Kushner added her to the list of education secretary prospects this week. During his campaign, Mr. Trump called for a $20 billion investment in school-choice programs, which can include charter schools and vouchers to attend private schools. Ms. Moskowitz has called her network proof that taxpayer-funded, privately operated charters can outperform traditional district schools. Some sites in her network of 41 charters have achieved some of the best passing rates in the city on state exams. She has often criticized district bureaucracy and the city teachers union. Opponents charge her network emphasizes relentless test preparation, rather than a holistic approach, and systematically nudges out struggling or special-needs students. Ms. Moskowitz has denied those accusations, while acknowledging that a Brooklyn site had a <U+201C>got-to-go<U+201D> list of difficult students in 2014. She said that was an aberration and the principal was disciplined. Ms. Moskowitz suggested last year she was contemplating a run for mayor but then said she wanted to concentrate on growing her charter network. She has long clashed with Mayor Bill de Blasio over whether he gives her enough public space for her schools. The mayor has said his administration allocates space according to its obligation under state law. Write to Leslie Brody at leslie.brody@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Uber and other companies in the sharing economy have had to spend millions fighting city and state regulators that try to stifle innovative services. Now New York has moved to crush the home-sharing service Airbnb in the city<U+2019>s five boroughs. Governor Andrew Cuomo late Friday signed legislation that would impose a fine of up to $7,500 on anyone who advertises a short-term rental apartment on a home-sharing site. That<U+2019>s more than the penalty for drunk driving. This cuts the core of Airbnb<U+2019>s business, which allows a family or young professional to earn cash by renting out a room or apartment while traveling away from home. The typical New York host earns more than $5,000 a year, and that<U+2019>s a nice fillip in a city with a high cost of living. The platform is popular with the thousands of visitors and tourists who visit the Big Apple each week. Many prefer not to pay $300 a night for a Holiday Inn Express , assuming they can even find a hotel room. The service fills a market need, and buyer and seller are better off, so naturally politicians want to mess with all this happiness and business efficiency. The politicians are responding to hoteliers and unions that claim that mini-Donald Trumps are buying up properties and renting them as <U+201C>illegal hotels.<U+201D> This doesn<U+2019>t check out: More than 95% of New York Airbnb hosts sharing their entire home post only one property, and the company last year yanked roughly 3,000 illegal listings out of some 44,000 in New York. The hotel industry also riled up some affordable housing groups to say that Airbnb is driving up the cost of rent. One irony is that more than three-quarters of hosts say that sharing their space helps them pay rent. The real complaint is that Airbnb is unwelcome competition, and here<U+2019>s how you know: The company already offered Empire State regulators everything they claimed to want. Airbnb said it would ban New York hosts from renting more than one property; require online registration for hosts; ban users who break policies three times; and collect state taxes so that hosts couldn<U+2019>t cheat. That<U+2019>s right: Airbnb wanted to help New York dig up more revenue. Airbnb has already sued to block the new law, and New York may need a good lawyer: Federal law pre-empts holding platforms like Airbnb responsible for the content of its advertising, and there<U+2019>s also the detail that the First Amendment protects commercial speech. As Airbnb general counsel Rob Chesnut put it in a letter to Gov. Cuomo and others last month: <U+201C>The ban on advertising is, at its core, a ban on speech.<U+201D> New York<U+2019>s censure serves no compelling government interest, unless you count enriching various Democratic constituencies. This is a classic restraint of trade, and all the more odious that it will hurt the people Democrats claim to champion. Airbnb points out that hosts in zip codes with the highest percentage of black New Yorkers earned $43 million from rentals in 2015, and that more than 21,000 millennials host an Airbnb property. New York<U+2019>s progressives claim to love the little guy, but they love big business donors more.",

        "original_post": "LIMA, Peru<U+2014>Leaders of Pacific Rim nations meeting in Peru said Saturday they would move forward with trade deals amid uncertainty about U.S. policies under President-elect Donald Trump. In a speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, which accounts for about half of global trade, Chinese President Xi Jinping said his government would support a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific and was pushing forward with the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a trade pact that includes 16 countries. In the next five years, China will import $8 trillion of goods and invest $750 billion abroad, he said. <U+201C>China will not shut its door to the outside<U+2026>but open even wider,<U+201D> Mr. Xi said. <U+201C>We will fully involve ourselves in economic globalization.<U+201D> <U+201C>We will also encourage more Chinese companies to go abroad,<U+201D> he said. China, the world<U+2019>s second-biggest economy after the U.S., could take on a greater role in global trade if Mr. Trump<U+2019>s administration pulls out of U.S.-led accords, analysts say. Some countries involved in the Trans-Pacific Partnership say they are now open to joining the Chinese-led RCEP, which includes India and Australia, as an alternative pact following uncertainty in the U.S. The TPP includes 12 countries, such as Chile, Japan, Mexico and Peru, but excludes China. Mr. Trump has pledged to pull the U.S. out of the TPP , which was strongly promoted by President Barack Obama, who arrived in Peru late Friday for the APEC summit. Prime Minister John Key of New Zealand, which is also a member of TPP, said countries would need to decide if they move forward without the U.S. if Mr. Trump follows through on his campaign promise to exit from the deal or sit down and renegotiate a new accord. <U+201C>There is a lot at stake with TPP,<U+201D> Mr. Key said. <U+201C>Economic integration across the region is important and it has worked.<U+201D> Mr. Trump<U+2019>s criticism of trade during the campaign also extended to the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. He has called for renegotiating that deal to bring back American manufacturing jobs more than 20 years after it was implemented. Mexican President Enrique Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto said Saturday he was optimistic his administration could reach a deal with Mr. Trump. <U+201C>More than just talking about renegotiating Nafta, it is modernizing Nafta,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>We have great opportunities in this new stage.<U+201D> Write to Ryan Dube at ryan.dube@dowjones.com",

        "original_post": "Highlights on this week<U+2019>s calendar include economic data, including the latest readings on growth and jobs, an appearance by the country<U+2019>s top central banker and Canadian bank earnings. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz delivers a speech late Monday in Toronto, which will focus on the services-side of the economy. The speech and subsequent press conference will be Mr. Poloz<U+2019>s last public appearance before the Bank of Canada issues its final rate decision for this calendar year on Dec. 7. The central bank held its policy rate at 0.5% in October, although Mr. Poloz said senior officials <U+201C>actively discussed<U+201D> adding further monetary easing due to weak conditions overall. Mr. Poloz<U+2019>s speech comes ahead of Wednesday<U+2019>s release of the country<U+2019>s third-quarter economic data from Statistics Canada. Early expectations are for annualized growth to surpass the 3% level in the July-to-September period, a rebound from the second-quarter decline fueled by wildfires in resource-rich Alberta. Still, the economy lost momentum in September, with weak figures for manufacturing and wholesaling, which analysts suggest sets the stage for weakness in the final quarter of the year. There<U+2019>s added longer-term uncertainty given the impact on exports to the U.S. with President-elect Donald Trump and his pledge to renegotiate the North American Free-Trade Agreement. Canada<U+2019>s big lenders kick off their fiscal fourth-quarter reporting season this week, led by Bank of Nova Scotia on Tuesday. Royal Bank of Canada follows on Wednesday, with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Toronto-Dominion Bank set to report Thursday. Bank of Montreal will close out bank-earnings season next week. Canada<U+2019>s Liberal government was widely expected last week to issue decisions regarding two Enbridge Inc. proposed pipelines, as the cabinet set a Nov. 25 deadline to release verdicts. The government is now expected to unveil those decisions this week, affecting the beleaguered Northern Gateway project and replacement of the Line 3 corridor linking the Alberta oil sands to Wisconsin. The week ends with the release Friday of employment data for November. Based on the last three months , the economy has added nearly 140,000 jobs. However, the unemployment rate has remained steady at 7%, in a sign that significant slack remains in the country<U+2019>s labor market. <U+2014>Judy McKinnon contributed to this article.

        "original_post": "LONDON<U+2014>Canada<U+2019>s finance minister said Wednesday the U.K. will need to complete exit talks with the European Union before it can pursue a trade deal with Canada. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a conference hosted by UBS Group AG, Bill Morneau said that the U.K. is Canada<U+2019>s fourth-largest trading partner and Ottawa expects to maintain close economic ties with Britain after its EU exit. But he added formal talks on a post-Brexit trade deal can<U+2019>t begin until the U.K. withdraws from the 28-member club. On talks between the EU and the U.K., he said <U+201C>that<U+2019>s a discussion that will precede any discussion with Canada,<U+201D> adding that <U+201C>any discussion with the U.K. will be a positive one.<U+201D> <U+201C>We<U+2019>re going to respect the process the U.K. is going through with the European Union, and only with the outcome of those discussions will we have the context to answer questions of what the next steps are,<U+201D> Mr. Morneau said. His remarks highlight a challenge facing U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May as she charts the U.K.<U+2019>s EU exit following a referendum on membership in June, where voters elected to leave the bloc. Proponents of Brexit argued the U.K. could quickly forge new trading relations with faster-growing parts of the world to augment or replace trade with Europe, which sucks in almost half U.K. exports. But EU treaties prevent member states from negotiating their own trade deals, meaning the U.K. can only formally ink new accords once it leaves. In the U.S., President-Elect Donald Trump has signaled he intends to renegotiate the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico, which he blames for whittling away at American jobs. Mr. Morneau said the jobs and growth in both the U.S. and Canada that depend on trade between the two nations provides <U+201C>a really excellent foundation from which we can talk about how to improve our relationship going forward.<U+201D> Write to Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "The New York Police Department released crime statistics Monday that showed last month was the safest September on record. City officials said the data further debunk claims of rising crime made at the first presidential debate. At the monthly crime briefing, Mayor Bill de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner James O<U+2019>Neill reported a 3% decline in overall crime so far in 2016, with 10 fewer murders through September than in the same period last year. The data come a week after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said in the first debate that murders were up in the city, and that the use of stop-and-frisk had a significant impact on previous declines in crime. <U+201C>I want to always try and dispel the misinformation we heard last Monday,<U+201D> said Mr. de Blasio. <U+201C>The amount of stop-and-frisk activity since its height in 2001 is down 97%,<U+201D> he added. <U+201C>So, affirming once again the clear reduction in the use of stop-and-frisk accompanied by the consistent reduction in crime.<U+201D> There were 97 fewer shooting incidents through September, an 11% decline from the same period a year ago. Murders were down 3.7%, from 272 to 262. There were 242,470 arrests over the first nine months, a drop of 7.4% and the lowest level recorded in the era of CompStat, the crime-tracking system the NYPD has been using since 1994. Misdemeanor arrests fell 6.7% and violation arrests were down 55%, while gun arrests were up 11.6%, including 17 incidents over the weekend. Assaults on police officers rose 24% to 995. Officials credited the city<U+2019>s community-policing program for the reduction of arrests and uptick in gun seizures. Starting this month, the NYPD<U+2019>s community policing program is expanding again, this time to nine precincts and three housing commands. The Neighborhood Coordination Officers Program, the initiative under which officers patrol the same area each day as a way to build relations with residents, is expanding to the Ninth Precinct in Manhattan and 28th Precinct in Harlem, the 41st Precinct in the Hunts Point area of the Bronx, two precincts in south Brooklyn, two others in north Brooklyn and one each in Jamaica and Astoria. The program is also expanding to housing projects in Brooklyn south, Jamaica, Queens and Manhattan south. This is a crime fighting plan that we have,<U+201D> said Commissioner O<U+2019>Neill. <U+201C>This is a shared responsibility.

        "original_post": "Copper rose to a fresh one-year high on Wednesday, boosted by bets on a rise in infrastructure spending and continued optimism over China demand. Copper for December delivery settled up 2.9% at $2.4480 a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, its biggest one-day gain in over a year. Wednesday marked the 13th consecutive session of gains for copper, the longest streak in at least 28 years. The metal has surged to its highest price since September 2015 over the past few weeks thanks to an upbeat outlook for China. The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president spurred further gains on Wednesday, as investors bet that demand would pick up with a focus on infrastructure. <U+201C>This is positive for U.S. growth to start with,<U+201D> said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB Markets, who noted that Mr. Trump has pledged to invest heavily in infrastructure spending and lower taxes, which could help demand for copper, a key building material. <U+201C>I think that<U+2019>s reflected in the stronger copper prices.<U+201D> Copper is expected to benefit from stabilizing economic health in China, building and construction growth, and a boost in power infrastructure, according to a Citi note on Wednesday. Positive economic data from China has helped lift copper prices in a broad base metals rally as the country makes up 45% of global demand. Still, some analysts expressed concerns about the size of the bump, as copper<U+2019>s rally has looked vulnerable to a change in market sentiment. <U+201C>We find this price response rather excessive, and not entirely understandable,<U+201D> said Commerzbank AG . The German bank said the gains could also be feeding on expectations that China won<U+2019>t be able to export as much material. <U+201C>Given there isn<U+2019>t really a fundamental change [to copper demand], I<U+2019>m thinking this is a bit of a false dawn,<U+201D> said Robin Bhar, a commodities analyst at Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale in London. Protectionist trade strategies that Mr. Trump has promoted could also hurt trade with China, the world<U+2019>s top copper consumer, in the long term, and the details of those policies were unclear. The London Metal Exchange<U+2019>s three-month copper contract closed up 3.4% at $5,413.00 a metric ton. Aluminum closed up 1.2% at $1,753.00 a ton, zinc closed up 0.5% at $2,490.00 a ton, nickel closed up 2.8% at $11,575.00 a ton and lead closed up 0.8% at $2,141.00 a ton.

But, even though they say they are depressed, does it mean they don<U+2019>t go to parties? Hell, no. Depressed people go to parties all the time, where they can talk about their depression with other people. Yes, a few events were canceled in the wake of Donald Trump defeating Hillary Clinton <U+2014>an art opening here, a fashion cocktail party there<U+2014>but it pretty much takes a real act of God for social New Yorkers to lock themselves in their apartments and miss an opportunity to party. That<U+2019>s one thing we are sure will remain status quo. Some of the events on Wednesday and Thursday alone included: the launch of a Jeremy Scott Google phone case and his line of animated emojis, your own line of animated emojis being the ultimate power play these days; drinks with Net-a-Porter to celebrate Rachelle MacPherson<U+2019>s sweater line Lingua Franca; the Swiss Institute<U+2019>s 30th anniversary benefit dinner; a conversation with curators for Cultured Magazine; the Warner Bros. premiere of the new J.K.

Obviously, fundraising must go on, but so does a having a bit of fun. That<U+2019>s not even the tip of this week<U+2019>s event iceberg.

And to acknowledge the elephant in the room<U+2014>sorry that<U+2019>s not the best animal.<U+201D> The comics on the bill, including George Lopez, John Oliver and Mike Birbiglia, certainly acknowledged the awkwardness of the evening. And as we learned from this party, three things help in the face of depression, which this particular event had in spades: laughter, small squares of pizza, and gummy candy. Those reasons are certainly good enough to leave the house. Write to Marshall Heyman at marshall.heyman@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "BEIJING<U+2014>The office of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping in a<U+00A0>Sunday<U+00A0>night (Eastern Standard Time)<U+00A0>phone call in which the two leaders established a <U+201C>clear sense of mutual respect.<U+201D> Mr. Trump<U+2019>s office confirmed the phone call early<U+00A0>Monday in Washington. Chinese state news broadcaster CCTV elaborated on the call, citing Mr. Xi as saying that cooperation was the <U+201C>sole correct choice<U+201D> of the two nations, and that such cooperation in the past had yielded benefits for both nations <U+201C>As the biggest developing nation, and the biggest developed nation, and the world<U+2019>s two biggest economies, China and the U.S. must cooperate and the matters that can be cooperated on are many,<U+201D> CCTV cited Mr. Xi as saying. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign was marked by heated rhetoric targeting China, which he has pledged to declare a currency manipulator . He additionally proposed imposing 45% trade tariffs on China over the course of his campaign and has threatened to withdraw from the global climate-change accord the Obama administration championed alongside Chinese leadership in Paris last year. U.S.-China bilateral relations have in recent years been roiled by issues as diverse as cybersecurity and Chinese conduct in the South China Sea, where Beijing has moved to actively stake its claim over contested territory through greater military buildup, aggravating tensions with its neighbors. According to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s office, the president-elect thanked Mr. Xi for his congratulations upon his election. <U+201C>During the call, the leaders established a clear sense of mutual respect for one another, and President-elect Trump stated that he believes the two leaders will have one of the strongest relationships for both countries moving forward,<U+201D> his office said.

        "original_post": "Gold prices pared gains Wednesday as U.S. stock markets recovered from an overnight tumble and investors digested what a Donald Trump presidency will mean for markets. Gold for December delivery settled down 0.1% at $1,273.50 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, after trading as high as $1,307.50 a troy ounce earlier in the session. Rising stocks weighed on gold prices, as risk appetite gradually returned to the market. The S&P 500 was recently up 0.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.2%. Gold <U+201C>is competing against a stock market that is exceptionally strong,<U+201D> said Ira Epstein, a strategist with the Linn Group. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s holding on actually quite well<U+201D> given the recovery. A stronger U.S. dollar also hurt gold prices Wednesday. The WSJ Dollar Index, which weighs the dollar against a basket of other currencies, was up 0.7% at 88.66. A stronger U.S. currency is bearish for gold, since the dollar-denominated metal becomes more expensive for foreign buyers. The precious metal surged as much as 5% as election results rolled in and started to favor a Trump victory. Although gold gave back all of its immediate gains, many analysts believe Mr. Trump<U+2019>s win will be good for gold prices going forward. <U+201C>Trump being elected creates nothing but muddy waters. The unknown continues to persist here,<U+201D> said Peter Hug, global trading director at Kitco Metals. The election could also influence the outlook for a December rate increase, traders said. Ahead of the election, traders largely expected the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December, bolstered by stable economic data and comments from central bank officials. However, the economic and political uncertainty following Tuesday<U+2019>s vote could derail plans for a rate increase. <U+201C>The focus is going to go back to the Fed, but now even more so,<U+201D> said Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist at RJO Futures. <U+201C>This might give the Fed a reason not to raise in December.<U+201D> Higher rates tend to be bearish for gold, since the metal pays its holders nothing and struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets when borrowing costs rise. For many traders, the volatility was reminiscent of the surprise British vote to leave the European Union. On June 24, following the Brexit vote, gold prices jumped more than 6% in a single day on safe haven demand. However, David Govett, head of precious metals at Marex Spectron, said this time, traders were ready, he said, with offices well staffed overnight. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s a general sort of feeling that people were more prepared this time,<U+201D> he said.

        "original_post": "Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are both hosting parties on Tuesday in New York that will draw thousands of people hoping to see history. Only a quick subway ride away will be at least hundreds of people watching an equally unforgettable event: the Minnesota Timberwolves are playing the Brooklyn Nets. It costs less to get into that game than it does to buy a beer once inside<U+2014>which is what happens when a U.S. presidential election has the audacity to be scheduled opposite the NBA and NHL. But in this conflict is an opportunity for anyone who can<U+2019>t bear the idea of watching election coverage. For at least one night, a sports game is a cheap distraction, according to SeatGeek, the ticket resale website that scoured its database for the lowest prices still available as of Sunday afternoon for Tuesday<U+2019>s counter-programing. It only takes $3 to soothe your nerves at the Denver Nuggets vs. Memphis Grizzlies game. And it only takes $18 to soothe your nerves in the third row at the Denver Nuggets vs. Memphis Grizzlies game. If you can<U+2019>t get into Trump or Clinton<U+2019>s events, you can pay $11 to calm down by counting the number of people at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Once you<U+2019>re there, you may want to splurge on a $12 beer, too. Tuesday nights in November are seldom a huge draw in the NHL and NBA even when there isn<U+2019>t an election going on. According to SeatGeek, the prices for this Tuesday night<U+2019>s games aren<U+2019>t much cheaper than the prices for a regular Tuesday night in November. For example, in the swing state of Ohio, there have been at least 10 games since LeBron James<U+2019>s homecoming with lower average resale prices than what it takes to see the Cleveland Cavaliers play the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday. But that means there are still deals on the secondary market. Tickets for the Edmonton Oilers at Pittsburgh Penguins game are the cheapest SeatGeek has seen for that matchup despite the fact that it will feature superstars Connor McDavid and Sidney Crosby. And tickets are as low as $12 for the Phoenix Suns vs. Portland Trail Blazers game at 10 p.m. ET. Perhaps because the election could be called on television as soon as 11 p.m. ET. The fans who do attend this game will probably spend more time checking their phones for political updates than they will watching basketball: The team does not plan to announce the results of the election inside the arena, a Trail Blazers<U+2019> spokesman said.

        "original_post": "Home buyers are rushing to get mortgages before rates rise further. Applications for mortgages to purchase homes soared 13% during the week ended Nov. 18 from the previous week, according to data released Wednesday by the Mortgage Bankers Association. That was also up 11% from a year earlier and the biggest weekly increase since early January. Refinancing applications, though, went the other way, dropping 3% from the previous week, continuing a steady slide as rising mortgage rates have damped demand among existing homeowners. Counted together, total mortgage applications rose 3% in the week, reversing course from a decline the previous week. The mortgage market has been shaken up since the election of Donald Trump as president. Mortgage rates have risen by about half a percentage point, averaging 4.10% for 30-year fixed conforming loans on Tuesday, according to MortgageNewsDaily.com. Late last week, mortgage rates hit 4.125%, the highest in 17 months. While still low by historical standards, the new rates are substantially higher for existing borrowers, many of whom locked in rates below 4% during the past few years. In early July, average rates on 30-year fixed mortgages were as low as 3.34%. Interest rates have spiked several times since the housing downturn, only to fall again. But lenders are growing wary, citing President-elect Trump<U+2019>s fiscal policies as well as the Federal Reserve<U+2019>s likely move to increase interest rates as soon as December. <U+201C>From the facts that we see out there, it looks like rates are going to settle at a higher rate than they did in the last few years,<U+201D> said Greg Gwizdz, national sales manager for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, a division of Wells Fargo & Co., the country<U+2019>s leading mortgage lender. Rising interest rates over the long run will make more-expensive homes less affordable for many borrowers, which in turn could affect the rate at which home values have been appreciating in many markets. The latest increase in purchase-mortgage demand was driven by borrowers seeking large mortgages. The average mortgage amount home buyers applied for last week reached $310,200, the highest in the Mortgage Bankers Association survey, which goes back to 1990.

        "original_post": "BRUSSELS<U+2014>Iran will ship about 11 metric tons of heavy water out of the country in the next couple of days, according to people familiar with the plans, defusing<U+00A0>a conflict with the U.S. and others over the Iranian nuclear deal. Earlier this week, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Yukiya Amano, expressed concerns that Iran had for the second time exceeded a 130-metric-ton threshold for its heavy-water stockpile. A metric ton is equivalent to 1.1 short tons. He warned that a repetition of this breach could undermine confidence in the full implementation of the July 2015 agreement designed to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Heavy water is used to cool uranium in a process that can be used to form plutonium. Since plutonium can be used in a nuclear weapon, the nuclear deal set a limit on how much heavy water Iran could store. According to people familiar with the plans, Iran has already sent the 11 metric tons of<U+00A0>heavy water to one of its ports, where it is under the seal of the IAEA, the United Nations atomic agency that is overseeing implementation of the nuclear<U+00A0>deal. After the material is shipped, likely to Oman<U+00A0>for sale into the international market, Iran<U+2019>s heavy-water stockpile will fall to about 120 metric tons. That should be enough to keep Iran away from the 130-metric-ton threshold for some months, one of the officials said. Iran is estimated to be capable of<U+00A0>producing<U+00A0>between 20 and 25 metric tons of heavy water a year. Iran and the U.S. clashed openly at this week<U+2019>s meeting of the IAEA board of governors over<U+00A0>Iranian implementation of the deal. The U.S. representative at the IAEA<U+00A0>said Iran must ship the material out of Iran quickly. <U+201C>Iran must strictly adhere to all commitments,<U+201D> U.S. IAEA Ambassador Laura Holgate said at the meeting, adding that Tehran should keep its stockpile <U+201C>well beneath<U+201D> 130 metric tons. <U+201C>We urge Iran to complete without delay its plan to resolve this issue,<U+201D> she said. Iran<U+2019>s representative at the agency told reporters on Thursday that<U+00A0>Iran would ship out more than 5 metric tons of material. However, he<U+00A0>said Iran believed it was complying with its obligations under the nuclear deal and that 130 metric tons was a soft target, not a hard limit. The clash over heavy water came in the days following the election of Donald Trump, who during the presidential campaign<U+00A0>threatened to tear up the nuclear deal. People involved in overseeing the Iranian nuclear deal say that at the very least, they believe<U+00A0>Mr. Trump is likely to crack down on any breach<U+00A0>of the terms of the nuclear deal by Iran. Corrections & Amplifications: Heavy water is used to cool uranium in a process that can be used to form plutonium, which can be used in a nuclear weapon. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that <U+201C>weapons-grade plutonium<U+201D> could be separated from heavy water.

        "original_post": "For those who live and work in and around Trump Tower, life is becoming a barricaded challenge. Since Donald Trump<U+2019>s election to the nation<U+2019>s highest office, security has increased around the president-elect<U+2019>s marquee building, which doubles as his primary residence until he moves to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. in Washington, D.C., come January. Trump Tower, a 68-story skyscraper at 725 Fifth Ave. between 56th and 57th streets, now has a heavy security presence, with police checkpoints set up around the building. Vehicle traffic along Fifth Avenue has slowed to a crawl. Metal and concrete barricades prevent easy access to the building, which houses such prominent retailers as Gucci and Niketown and boasts a five-story atrium that has long been a tourist magnet. The building also has more than 200 luxury condominiums and several floors of commercial tenants. The security situation was made all the more unnerving for residents and nearby businesses when an estimated 10,000 anti-Trump demonstrators marched up Fifth Avenue to the building Wednesday evening. <U+201C>The protest night was horrendous,<U+201D> said Alice Landau, a resident of Trump Tower for more than 25 years who divides her time between New York and Switzerland. Because of the crowds and the security checks, she said, it was difficult to make her way home. Gucci and Tiffany & Co., which operates a store next door to Trump Tower, declined to say whether business has been affected, but Dominic Amato, general manager of Obic<U+00E0> NY Madison, a restaurant near the tower, said sales have been down by as much as 20% since Election Day. <U+201C>Wednesday was a complete nightmare,<U+201D> he said. New York Police Department Commissioner James O<U+2019>Neill said Friday that <U+201C>enhanced security<U+201D> would be in place at Trump Tower for the coming months, including vehicle restrictions on Fifth Avenue, though the measures could be relaxed when Mr. Trump moves to the White House. The commissioner said the department is working with the Secret Service on plans, aiming to minimize disruptions for area residents and businesses. <U+201C>We just have to make sure that we have security but also the ability to have New Yorkers go about their business,<U+201D> Mr. O<U+2019>Neill said. Officials with the Trump Organization and Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign didn<U+2019>t respond to requests for comment. <U+2014>Josh Barbanel and Jim Oberman contributed to this article.

        "original_post": "With Donald Trump <U+2019>s presidential victory, markets are saying that inflation will return from its long hiatus. But after years of nearly flat prices, there are reasons to doubt that inflation will rise meaningfully. In the two days after the election, Treasurys, which fare worse under higher inflation, have fallen sharply . Inflation expectations embedded in Treasury-inflation-protected securities have pushed higher. Shares of cyclical companies, which perform better in a higher-inflation environment, have risen, while the bond-like dividend paying stocks have suffered. Investors are reacting to what they believe are going to be Mr. Trump<U+2019>s policies. His antitrade and anti-immigration stance would boost inflation by slapping tariffs on imported goods and forcing companies to pay higher wages to replace immigrant workers in an already tight labor market. His plans for economic stimulus driven by tax cuts and infrastructure spending would boost demand, potentially driving up inflation. The stimulus plan would come at an unusual time in the economic cycle. In recent months, inflation has been picking up after a long, though tepid, economic expansion. With the job market getting tighter, wage growth has ticked up. This comes as the world economy looks a little better. These are the reasons the Federal Reserve is likely to raise rates in December and then gradually from there if inflation rises from the current 1.2% by its preferred measure to its target of 2%. Usually, the government launches a stimulus plan when the economy is shrinking and shedding jobs. With the plan coming at a time when the economy is relatively strong, it makes sense that investors think inflation could get a powerful boost. But a lot of things need to happen for inflation to jump. First, workers need to become scarce enough for employers to meaningfully boost wages. Then, employers have to pass those wage gains on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Finally, consumers need to be willing to cough up for higher prices<U+2014>something that, in light of the caution they have shown since the financial crisis, doesn<U+2019>t seem like a gimme. Inflation is probably set to glow a bit more warmly, but investors may be wrong to think Mr. Trump<U+2019>s presidency will bellow it into a flame.",

Mr. McCrory<U+2019>s move to call for a recount, announced Tuesday, could mean that the matter won<U+2019>t be settled for at least several more weeks.

His rival Mr. Cooper already declared victory in the Nov. 8 election and started assembling a transition team.

        "original_post": "It was at times difficult to watch, but Donald Trump scored a desperately needed victory in Sunday night<U+2019>s presidential debate in St. Louis. He addressed crude comments he made 11 years ago and bested Hillary Clinton on issues such as health care and the economy. Your humble correspondent would not have recommended Mr. Trump<U+2019>s approach of delving into the mistreatment of women at the hands of Bill and Hillary Clinton. But Mr. Trump was clear and coherent in contrasting his own words to Clinton actions. Click here to receive this daily Opinion summary via email. After the candidates spent the early part of the debate trading ethical charges, the evening was surprisingly substantive. This was in large part because this time the GOP candidate had done his homework. <U+201C>On the issues Mr. Trump was much better prepared on Sunday, and he kept Mrs. Clinton on the defensive on taxes, ObamaCare and her own ethical problems with her private email server,<U+201D> writes the editorial board . Mr. Trump made a strong case for tax reform to revive economic growth, and correctly noted that his plan would bring one of the world<U+2019>s highest tax rates on corporate income down to a level that would be among the most competitive. Combined with a commitment to reduce the regulatory burden and appoint Supreme Court Justices who will follow the Constitution<U+2014>including the Second Amendment<U+2014>he gave Republican voters ample reason to stay on board his controversial campaign. While Mr. Trump<U+2019>s arguments on foreign policy were at times hard to follow, Mrs. Clinton also struck out when discussing the Middle East. The Democrat described various parts of the process of conducting foreign policy in the region but never offered a clear strategy. More generally, Mr. Trump keeps asking where the results are from her decades in public life and last night voters saw that Hillary Clinton still has no good answer to this question. The principal achievement she claims for herself is a deal on children<U+2019>s health insurance cut by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) and the late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D., Mass.) while she was First Lady in the 1990s. <U+201C>With her, it<U+2019>s all talk and no action,<U+201D> said Mr. Trump. The line of the night occurred after Mrs. Clinton compared herself to Abraham Lincoln in attempting to explain away her comment to a crowd of bankers that politicians sometimes needed to have a public position and a private position on an issue. <U+201C>Honest Abe never lied<U+201D> responded Mr. Trump. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.<U+201D> Mrs. Clinton also failed in her principal mission of persuading voters that Mr. Trump is unacceptable and unfit to lead. This was brought home in the last comments of the evening, when a member of the debate audience asked each candidate to say something nice about the other. Both answered graciously, and the final impression was of two people who really aren<U+2019>t all that bad. Election Day is still nearly a month away, so it<U+2019>s too early to say Mr. Trump saved his campaign<U+2014>or even the Republican Congress<U+2014>with his performance in St. Louis. But it was a start.",

The trigger is usually similar; a wire, a fishing line, a string or twine. But the mechanism of alarm is a varied as there are ideas. In this case, when activated, a spark by a battery causes wires to burn. I don't know why they wouldn't attach a firecracker or some kind of explosive device. Making a trip wire alarm system... After watching this I'm going to assume that this trip wire device is incomplete. What good are the burning wires? It doesn't alarm anyone. Rather, I'd like to see some kind of device that makes a loud noise. I think we're going to get some fires started with this thing. Related:",

        "original_post": "MEXICO CITY<U+2014>Mexico<U+2019>s economic growth accelerated in the third quarter, with growth in services continuing to offset weakness in industrial production, the National Statistics Institute said Wednesday. Gross domestic product, a measure of output of goods and services, grew 1.0% from the second quarter and was up 2.0% from the year-earlier period. The expansion from the second quarter was unchanged from the institute<U+2019>s preliminary estimate, and translates into a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 4.0%. GDP for the second quarter was revised to a 0.1% expansion from a previously reported contraction. Services rose 1.4% from the second quarter, with private consumption supported by low inflation and employment and credit growth. Industrial production barely grew, however, as a sluggish U.S. manufacturing sector weighed on demand for Mexican factory exports, oil and gas production continued to decline, and government budget cuts limited construction. Despite the pickup, Mexico<U+2019>s economy is on track to slow down from the 2.6% full-year growth seen in 2015. In the first nine months of this year growth was 2.3%. A number of economists have cut their growth expectations for 2017 and beyond, citing uncertainty about the trade and immigration policies that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will implement once in office. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election victory sent the peso to new lows against the U.S. dollar and prompted the central bank to raise interest rates to avoid knock-on effects on inflation. The uncertainty is expected to put the brakes on new investment decisions, at least in the near term. Mr. Trump said this week that his government will pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but made no mention of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, which he has said he would renegotiate to improve terms for the U.S. or abandon. Many consider that the integration of supply chains across the region will keep the U.S. from pulling out of Nafta altogether, and some expect to see only limited trade barriers since they would also hurt U.S. manufacturers. <U+201C>This makes it less likely that the more extreme protectionist measures that were a central feature of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign will be implemented,<U+201D> Capital Economics said in a report. Still, the London-based research firm joined others in lowering its Mexico growth outlook for next year, as it also expects rising inflation and higher local interest rates to prove a drag on the economy. Banks polled this week by Citibanamex lowered their median expectation for growth next year to 1.8% from 2.3%. The Bank of Mexico cut its 2017 forecast by half a percentage point to between 1.5% and 2.5%, with more risks on the downside, but stressed that the precise position the U.S. will adopt regarding relations with Mexico isn<U+2019>t known. The central bank<U+2019>s base case is that the bilateral commercial relationship will continue to work well. Write to Anthony Harrup at anthony.harrup@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "The big winners from Donald Trump <U+2019>s pick for Treasury Secretary are unlikely to be Steven Mnuchin <U+2019>s old haunts on Wall Street, but Main Street banks like the one he helped revive after the financial crisis. Mr. Mnuchin<U+2019>s background as a bond trader and executive at Goldman Sachs does seem at odds with the populist tone of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign, as does his history of donating to top Democrats. But just what this may mean for policy toward top Wall Street institutions is unclear. Appearing on CNBC Wednesday, Mr. Mnuchin said his top regulatory priority is to <U+201C>strip back parts of Dodd-Frank,<U+201D> saying the law is too complicated and restricts lending. As with other pronouncements from Mr. Trump<U+2019>s team on Dodd-Frank, this is frustratingly vague as to what exactly he would like to change about the financial regulation law. For clues, it helps to look past Mr. Mnuchin<U+2019>s Goldman pedigree. Perhaps the most interesting part of Mr. Mnuchin<U+2019>s resume is his time at troubled lender IndyMac Bank . Mr. Mnuchin led a group of investors who bought the company from the federal government after the financial crisis. The bank was renamed OneWest and eventually sold to CIT Group , where Mr. Mnuchin currently has a board seat. CIT is among the midsize lenders that critics say are most burdened by Dodd-Frank. With $66 billion of total assets, it is above the law<U+2019>s $50 billion threshold for annual stress testing by the Federal Reserve. But without the scale of megabanks like J.P. Morgan Chase , it is burdened with significantly increased regulatory costs. Fed oversight has also meant that CIT has been slow to return capital to shareholders. In July, CIT said the Federal Reserve had objected to the bank<U+2019>s capital return plan on qualitative grounds. Mr. Mnuchin will likely have to resign his board seat and divest his shares in CIT, and he will be keen to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest. But it wouldn<U+2019>t be a stretch to suppose that his experience at CIT will make him more attuned than other regulators to the struggles of small and midsize financial institutions. Lending by regional banks, he told CNBC on Wednesday, is <U+201C>the engine of growth to small- and medium-sized businesses.<U+201D> Mr. Mnuchin also said that he may extend the maturity of U.S. debt, which would involve issuing more long-term bonds in anticipation of rates rising in the future. That would likely steepen the yield curve, another welcome development for banks as it would make lending more profitable. Momentum is already building in Washington for legislation to raise the threshold for annual stress testing from $50 billion to $250 billion of assets. With Mr. Mnuchin at Treasury, this is looking like one Trump policy that investors can bank on. Write to Aaron Back at aaron.back@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "A week into Donald Trump <U+2019>s America, the tech sector has been deemed the Biggest Loser. Therein lies some opportunity. Tech stocks have been a notable underperformer since last week<U+2019>s election. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has set fresh records, while the S&P 500 has picked up 2%. But the 10 largest-cap tech names on the roster have fallen nearly 2%, on average. Internet stocks in particular have taken the brunt. The so-called FANG stocks<U+2014> Facebook , Amazon.com , Netflix and Google parent Alphabet <U+2014>are down nearly 5%, on average, since last week<U+2019>s vote. There are a variety of reasons for this, including concerns about how the new administration will view issues like net neutrality , the use of H1-B visas for skilled foreign workers and the industry<U+2019>s reliance on offshore manufacturing and service labor. Tech stocks also have suffered from investors cycling into other sectors believed to have more potential to benefit from the new administration. Richer valuations also make tech stocks more vulnerable, though relative multiples already had been moderating. The Nasdaq Composite is now at a 17% premium to the S&P 500 as a multiple of forward earnings. That premium was 30% at the start of the year. Apple, down about 1% since the vote, was trading at less than 10 times forward earnings excluding net cash even before Mr. Trump won the White House. All of this market movement presumes that people have any idea what Mr. Trump will do once in office, and how his policies will affect companies. For tech, whatever worries are weighing on investors can easily be offset by potential positives for the sector such as a tax break on cash repatriated from offshore. The 10 largest tech companies alone are sitting on more than half a trillion dollars in offshore cash. For Apple and Microsoft , offshore cash represents 36% and 24% of their respective market values. For all the ups and downs of tech stocks, there is one broad thing investors need to remember: The underlying dynamics of the sector aren<U+2019>t really changing. Tech has broadly benefited from two large-scale trends: the shift toward mobile and the quest for efficiency. That drives demand for everything from smartphones and chips to social networks and cloud-based corporate software. Which means that under President Trump, Apple will still be a highly profitable company still faced with the challenge of diversifying from the iPhone . Internet users won<U+2019>t search Google any less. Businesses won<U+2019>t curb their hunt for greater efficiency. And consumers will still likely spend boatloads on Amazon. Some things, even a president can<U+2019>t change.",

        "original_post": "SAN DIEGO, Calif.<U+2014>Rep. Darrell Issa, one of the highest-profile Republicans in Congress, was fighting for survival in the 49th congressional district early Wednesday. The closeness of the race for the eight-term congressman, who had generally won comfortable victories in the past, is a sign of the continuing weakness of the GOP in California<U+2014>a departure from the rest of the party nationwide as it celebrated the election of Donald Trump as president . With only partial results in Tuesday night, Rep. Issa said <U+201C>it looks like it will be a narrow victory.<U+201D> At the time he said he was up about 3-4 percentage points despite what he estimated to be about $7 million of outside spending on behalf of his Democratic rival, Doug Applegate. Mr. Applegate is a retired Marine colonel and Iraq war veteran. <U+201C>I<U+2019>ve done everything I can do to win,<U+201D> said Mr. Issa, whose district encompasses coastal areas of northern San Diego county and southern Orange County. With 28% of precincts reporting, Mr. Issa had 52% of the vote and Mr. Applegate had 48%, according to the Associated Press. But the race had not been declared. Mr. Issa, 63, who was first elected to Congress in 2000, has been a staunch critic of President Obama and a supporter of Donald Trump. As chair of a powerful House investigative committee for several years he looked into a range of controversial actions and programs of the Obama administration, such as the Internal Revenue Service<U+2019>s treatment of nonprofits aligned with conservative causes. A close race had been expected for months. In the June primary, Mr. Issa won 50.8% of the vote just 5 percentage points ahead of Mr. Applegate. The 62-year-old Mr. Applegate was seen as a potentially more appealing candidate in the district than past Democratic opponents, in part because of his background as a retired Marine colonel and Iraq war veteran. The district is home to a major Marine base at Camp Pendleton. Though Orange and San Diego counties have long been bastions of Republican support, the GOP<U+2019>s position there has been eroding as California becomes increasingly dominated by Democratic and independent voters. Currently, all statewide officeholders are Democrats, as are the two U.S. senators. Democrats comprise majorities in California<U+2019>s congressional delegation and both houses of the state legislature. Write to John R. Emshwiller at john.emshwiller@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "PRESCOTT VALLEY, Ariz.<U+2014>Republican presidential nominee Donald<U+00A0>Trump blamed his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, for a U.S. tax code that allowed him to declare a big loss and likely reduced or even eliminated his federal liability for years. <U+201C>Why didn<U+2019>t she ever try to change those laws so I couldn<U+2019>t use them?<U+201D> Mr.<U+00A0>Trump<U+00A0>said Tuesday at a campaign rally here, referring to her time as a U.S. senator from New York from 2001 to 2009. <U+201C>The reason that she did not do that is her donors and contributors have used those same tax laws as I did. The same way.<U+201D> Mr. Trump<U+2019>s tax records that were disclosed over the weekend were from 1995, several years before Mrs. Clinton took office. Mr. Trump himself has been a Clinton donor. Since 2002, he has donated $4,700 to Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s Senate and presidential campaigns, according to Federal Election Commission filings, though he was ultimately refunded $4,000. Five weeks from election day, Mr.<U+00A0>Trump<U+00A0>returned to Arizona for the first time since a noted immigration speech in the state on Aug. 31. Although the state has been a conservative stronghold for Republican presidential candidates, a Wall Street Journal\/NBC News\/Marist poll in Arizona last month showed Mr.<U+00A0>Trump<U+00A0>with a lead of just 1 percentage point in the state. Mr.<U+00A0>Trump<U+00A0>reminded the crowd of several thousand that he wanted to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, which drew applause and chants of <U+201C>build the wall.<U+201D> Mr.<U+00A0>Trump<U+00A0>has spent several days trying to counter the unauthorized release of some of his tax records by acknowledging the unfairness of the U.S. tax code. He has cast himself as the only candidate in the race who understands the nuances of the complex laws. During two rallies in Colorado on Monday, Mr.<U+00A0>Trump<U+00A0>said he had a fiduciary responsibility to pay as little tax as possible. He acknowledged that it was unfair and vowed to make the tax code more balanced. But in Arizona on Tuesday, Mr.<U+00A0>Trump<U+00A0>mostly returned to his stump speech, promising to be a law-and-order president who would halt illegal immigration and reduce crime and poverty in America<U+2019>s major cities. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m going to keep the terrorists the hell out of the country,<U+201D> Mr.<U+00A0>Trump<U+00A0>said on Tuesday. Earlier in the day, Mr.<U+00A0>Trump<U+00A0>held a private meeting with about a dozen energy executives in Denver, where he repeated complaints from the campaign trail that the industry is saddled with too many regulations. <U+201C>The energy business is being decimated,<U+201D> he said. Trump<U+00A0>repeatedly criticized Mrs. Clinton during the meeting for what he said was her support of overregulation of the energy industry. Write to Michael C. Bender at Mike.Bender@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Mortgage demand is falling fast, an early preview of the risks from the sudden jump in interest rates. Mortgage applications in the week ended Nov. 11 fell 9.2% from a week earlier as demand fell for both refinances and purchases, according to data Wednesday from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Demand for both types of transactions is now back to early 2016 levels, when average rates on 30-year fixed mortgages were last above 4%. Mortgage rates rose in the wake of Donald Trump <U+2019>s election last week as 10-year Treasury yields leapt. The average rate on 30-year fixed mortgages has been climbing every day since Mr. Trump was elected, reaching 4.02% on Tuesday<U+2014>up 0.40 of a percentage point since election day, according to MortgageNewsDaily.com. That is the largest increase in four days of trading since June 2013 when the Federal Reserve announced it might dial back its stimulus program. Lenders and analysts are cautioning that too much of a pickup in a short period could hit demand for mortgages. That could have a domino effect on home prices that have appreciated rapidly in many U.S. housing markets over the last two years. Low interest rates have allowed home buyers to purchase more expensive homes than they would otherwise be able to afford. Rising rates, in contrast, would place more homes out of reach for buyers. Some analysts are predicting that rising rates will result in home values in certain U.S. markets declining next year . Mortgage sales also are at stake. Origination volume was a bright spot for many banks and nonbank lenders before the election. Mortgage rates were ranging between 3.4% and 3.7% for much of the year, helped in large part by the U.K.<U+2019>s Brexit vote. That sent 10-year Treasury yields plummeting. Several large banks went on a hiring spree and a mortgage bankers<U+2019>s trade group predicted total origination volume would hit nearly $1.9 trillion this year, the highest since 2012.

        "original_post": "Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had her best fundraising month so far in the election, raising $84 million for her campaign and another $70 million in joint Democratic Party funds in September. The Clinton campaign<U+2019>s September haul was up from the $62 million in donations to her campaign the previous month, although the joint fundraising was down from about $80 million, a spokesman said on Saturday. Joint fundraising money goes to the Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee and the state Democratic parties. Mrs. Clinton ended September with more than $59 million in her campaign<U+2019>s bank account, on top of $91 million in the joint funds<U+2019> coffers, meaning she should have plenty of financial firepower to air TV ads and expand her field operations heading into the final weeks of the election. Her improved fundraising in September was likely to maintain her financial advantage over Republican rival Donald Trump, who had $50 million in his campaign<U+2019>s bank account and $47 million in joint funds at the end of August. Mr. Trump hasn<U+2019>t released his September fundraising totals and isn<U+2019>t required to do so until later this month. While Mr. Trump<U+2019>s fundraising has lagged behind Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s over the course of the election, he posted a hefty one-day fundraising total the day after last Monday<U+2019>s first presidential debate, garnering $18 million for his campaign and joint funds in 24 hours. The Clinton campaign said on Saturday that 2.6 million people have contributed to Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s election run, including more than 900,000 in September. The campaign said its average donation in September was $56. <U+201C>We must continue to step up in order to have the resources we need to mobilize millions of voters across the country,<U+201D> Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said.

Donald Trump <U+2019>s surprise victory was part of the reason for the green shoot. Hillary Clinton had repeatedly vowed to curb the high prices of some prescription drugs, for instance. With Republicans in control of Congress and Mrs. Clinton out of the picture, the <U+00A0>probability of that outcome has diminished.

And a Trump win won<U+2019>t cure some fundamental factors that have helped drive a wretched year for health-care stocks.

        "original_post": "Industrial metals climbed and copper prices shot to more than one-year highs on Thursday, as investors put their trust in President-elect Donald Trump to spend on U.S. infrastructure. Copper for December delivery settled up 3.7% at $2.5510 a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest close since July 2015. This built on a more than 3% gain Wednesday following the news that the Republican nominee had been elected president. <U+201C>Rather than being paralyzed with shock or engaging in panicked selling, participants on the metals markets appear to be responding not only calmly but even with downright euphoria to the news of Donald Trump<U+2019>s election as the new U.S. president,<U+201D> Commerzbank AG said. Mr. Trump has said he would cut taxes and invest more than $500 billion in infrastructure, which could lift demand for metals used for building and manufacturing. <U+201C>If [investors] are taking this at face value, that<U+2019>s going to be good for metals prices,<U+201D> said William Adams, head of research at FastMarkets in London. Large projects could significantly boost base metals, which have risen swiftly this year after struggling with overcapacity, stockpiles and weakening demand from China, the world<U+2019>s top consumer. Copper<U+2019>s surge builds on a multiweek rally, which has lifted prices on expectations of resurgent Chinese manufacturing growth and falling stockpiles of the metal in Shanghai and London. However, the extended gains have raised questions on the sustainability of copper<U+2019>s recent move higher. <U+201C>This is just extra fuel at the late end of the rally,<U+201D> said Mr. Adams. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s all gone a bit hot, I think. Too hot.<U+201D> Analysts were also skeptical that the Trump-related gains could be sustained, noting that his protectionist policies could hurt trade with China. Natixis <U+2019>s Bernard Dahdah said the picture would be unclear until January when Mr. Trump is inaugurated. <U+201C>The things he says, does he mean them or not?<U+201D> the metals analyst asked. Thursday<U+2019>s gains weren<U+2019>t limited to copper. <U+201C>Sentiment is even more bullish in China<U+2019>s iron ore and steel markets, despite the threat of increasing protectionism in the U.S.,<U+201D> said Carsten Menke, a commodities research analyst at Julius Baer. Chinese-traded iron ore prices are up almost 17% this week, while steel prices have risen 10%, Mr. Menke said. The London Metal Exchange<U+2019>s three-month copper contract closed up 3.4% at $5,601.00 a metric ton. Aluminum closed up 1% at $1,770.00 a ton, zinc closed up 1.4% at $2,525.00 a ton, tin rose 1.1% to $21,505.00 a ton and lead rose 0.6% to $2,154.00 a ton.

        "original_post": "The election seems poised to make a bad year worse for the drug industry. A proposed California ballot measure with a realistic chance of passing threatens to hurt pricing. Other states will take notice. In Washington, the outcome could be bad either way. If Hillary Clinton wins and is able to implement her health-care plan, drug companies could be hit. If Donald Trump wins and is able to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, the uncertainty would weigh on the sector. Shares of health-care companies reflect the dismal outlook . The NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index is down nearly 15% over the past three months. But the selloff has put the industry in a solid position, no matter how the elections play out. First, the decline is partially attributable to signs that the industry is lifting prices less aggressively than in years past. In other words, the bad stuff that investors fear is already happening, Second, the drug industry has the willingness and ability to wage a fight. Investors can count on a long legal battle before any law goes into effect. For evidence, look at how patent lawsuits by drug companies have slowed the adoption of biosimilars, lower priced versions of expensive biologic drugs. Pharma companies have spent more than $100 million in opposing California<U+2019>s Prop 61. The industry lobbyist raised dues from its member companies for 2017, in part to push back on more drug price regulation. The combination of battered shares and the industry<U+2019>s proven ability to adapt to change should limit the effects of any unwanted results on Tuesday.

Those who throw stones need to address their own transgressions. But Americans and the Clintons should not dignify the situation with counterattacks on Donald Trump<U+2019>s family, to avoid causing pain to his wives and children. The American people put this scandal to rest years ago, and today we understand: No marriage is flawless. Republicans tried to exploit the Clintons<U+2019> marital issues during Bill<U+2019>s presidency, having not learned that Americans can separate the Clintons<U+2019> private matters from all they have accomplished. The right-wing attempts should fail again. Americans will vote for their candidates based on the important issues of today. SHEILA FOX Baltimore To the Editor: Hillary Clinton fought back against the truth, and she either was willfully blind to the truth or considered it a mere inconvenience to be swept away. When <U+201C>Mrs. Clinton expressed pleasure to her friend that she and her husband were able to drive <U+2018>their adversaries totally nuts<U+2019> because they did not appear to be suffering,<U+201D> she also expressed what a Clinton Restoration will mean for the future <U+2014> suffering for the rest of us. The Clintons may have a high threshold of pain, but the nation should not have to endure the pain and suffering of another Clinton presidency. DENNIS L. BREO New Smyrna Beach, Fla. To the Editor: After exhaustively chronicling Benghazi and Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s email transgressions, now you run a story on how she grappled with her husband<U+2019>s infidelity. Really? This is not news. If the point of your article is that Mrs. Clinton was mean to the women who accused her husband of having sex with them, so be it. Does this suggest that her regard for women is the same as Donald Trump<U+2019>s? Hardly. She was an irate wife, fighting to save her marriage, and their careers. Politically and professionally, she has spent her career championing the rights of women and minorities. Mr. Trump has focused on enriching himself at the expense of others, while denigrating women for fun.

        "original_post": "Quick, someone get the smelling salts for the media. Ever since that dastardly Donald Trump told Chris Wallace, <U+201C>I<U+2019>ll keep you in suspense<U+201D> about recognizing the election result, we haven<U+2019>t seen so much swooning and fainting since Scarlett O<U+2019>Hara in <U+201C>Gone With the Wind.<U+201D> Starting with the 2000 election, it became Democratic writ that election outcomes could be questioned and contested. To this day many Democrats have convinced themselves, via repetition, that George W. Bush stole the 2000 election in Florida. In fact, Mr. Bush won the original count and the mandatory mini-recount. Virtually all serious attempts to finalize the Florida vote came to the same conclusion. Mr. Bush won. It was Al Gore who pushed the result into the courts of Florida in an effort to have the initial result overturned. Finally, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that enough was enough. The Florida recount fight made for great melodrama, but it was a media circus, and a destructive one. The partisan divide created by that sensational event is responsible in part for the divisions that endure to this day. Four years later, Democrats again argued extensively that George Bush stole the election from John Kerry because the President<U+2019>s campaign surrogates engineered the vote in Ohio against John Kerry. Mr. Kerry conceded the election, and it must be noted that he kept his own qualms private for many years. Both parties have since created a cottage industry dedicated to bird-dogging future election results in precincts around the country. And that<U+2019>s fine. Keep the politicians honest. Now comes Donald Trump, with his usual rank amateur flair, suggesting that if he loses it will be because the entire U.S. electoral system<U+2014>presumably encompassing all 50 states<U+2014>was fixed against him. As always, it fell to post-debate surrogates to make the distinctions he himself is incapable of making between discrete events<U+2014>Illinois in 1960, Florida in 2000<U+2014>and the legitimacy of the entire system. For failing to make any such distinction, Mr. Trump once again reaps a media whirlwind that blows his candidacy off Hillary Clinton <U+2019>s manifest vulnerabilities. None of that excuses the American media<U+2019>s faux fainting spell over this episode. We know that the normal cynicism of the media class hasn<U+2019>t been displaced by an endemic naivete about politics. The extraordinary overweighting of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s ham-handed and self-defeating remark will only feed the widespread public impression that the media are trying to preordain the election<U+2019>s outcome.",

        "original_post": "Donald Trump has proved markets wrong. Ill-positioned for the startling outcome, investors now have to sort out a tectonic shift in American politics flat-footed. The first reaction will be a heavy dose of mayhem as markets digest the shock. U.S. stocks seem poised to drop sharply Wednesday, with stock futures falling sharply in Tuesday night trading. The dollar fell in Asian trading, with the Japanese yen and the euro rallying more than 2% as results came in for Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s performance sends a glaring signal. Half the U.S. electorate has rejected the status quo of policy making and global economic order. The global consensus toward more unfettered trade is surely behind us, as foreshadowed by the U.K.<U+2019>s vote to exit the European Union. A trade war with China and Mexico may not materialize, but a more insular looking America would surely hurt companies that sell abroad, such as Boeing and Intel, and those that produce abroad but sell in the U.S., such as Apple. Domestic companies, such as media and telecom stocks like Verizon and Comcast, would appear more insulated. Companies like pharmaceuticals, seen as exposed to a Hillary Clinton presidency, could be buoyed by Mr. Trump<U+2019>s win. A Trump win raises massive questions on how the world<U+2019>s largest economy will be managed. An expected rate increase next month comes into question if the Federal Reserve is unnerved by the market<U+2019>s reaction. Meanwhile, the longer-term management of the Fed is up in the air should Mr. Trump win. Janet Yellen <U+2019>s term expires in January 2018, and Mr. Trump has promised to replace her. Some will dismiss the Trump win as a Brexit redux and the market reaction as a short-term blip. That take dismisses the real effects Brexit still holds for the U.K. economy as it is worked out. But more importantly, the U.K. economy is just 3.5% of the world<U+2019>s. The U.S. is a quarter of the world<U+2019>s. Its currency underpins the global monetary system. A Clinton win would have likely represented continuity for investors: a left-leaning Democrat facing at least a partially Republican Congress. But Mr. Trump isn<U+2019>t just another Republican president with a predictable pro-business collection of policies. He supports maintaining entitlements and dismantling the free-trade consensus that has ruled U.S. economic policy for a generation. His relationship with a Republican-controlled Congress, many of whose members opposed him, will determine how much of his agenda, from building a wall with Mexico to slashing tax rates, is passed. His way of thinking will be a powerful force in the Republican Party and in politics generally. The election is ending, but the uncertainty for investors may have only begun.

        "original_post": "Michelle Obama will make her first appearance with Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail on Thursday, attending a rally to try to encourage early voting in North Carolina. Eight years ago, the thought of Mrs. Obama being Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s most powerful campaigner would have been unimaginable. The Democratic primary in 2008 between Mrs. Clinton and Barack Obama was grueling and brutal. That Mrs. Obama has thrown herself into the role of defending Mrs. Clinton so completely and, in the minds of many political observers, so effectively is among the most notable story lines of the tumultuous 2016 campaign. The rally will take place in Winston-Salem. Mr. Obama won North Carolina in 2008, but he lost it in 2012. However, polls have shown the state to be in play this year, and a New York Times Upshot\/Siena College poll this week showed Mrs. Clinton with a seven-point lead in the state. Beginning with her Democratic National Convention speech , Mrs. Obama has sought to make a compelling, optimistic case for Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s candidacy, one that has cut above the din of the slashing presidential cycle. She has described Mrs. Clinton as the natural extension of, and best hope for preserving, her husband<U+2019>s legislative accomplishments, such as the Affordable Care Act. She has made the case for Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s determination. And she has offered herself as a character witness for a candidate who has historically high unfavorable ratings as the Democratic nominee. <U+201C>When they go low, we go high,<U+201D> Mrs. Obama said at the convention, a line that Mrs. Clinton has since used as a weapon against attacks from her rival, Donald J. Trump. Most striking has been Mrs. Obama<U+2019>s evolution from reluctant campaign spouse in the 2008 cycle, one whom Republicans and some Democrats repeatedly caricatured as divisive, into the most popular figure in the Democratic Party. She is repeatedly mentioned as someone Democrats hope will run for office. But there is no evidence she has any interest in doing so.

        "original_post": "BEIJING <U+2014> Donald J. Trump has called China a <U+201C>currency manipulator,<U+201D> threatened to impose stiff tariffs on Chinese imports and accused the country of inventing the idea of climate change to hurt American businesses. But in his first telephone conversation with President Xi Jinping of China, Mr. Trump, now the president-elect, appeared to set aside those critiques expressed on the campaign trail, vowing that the two nations would have <U+201C>one of the strongest relationships,<U+201D> according to a statement released by Mr. Trump<U+2019>s transition office, Reuters reported . Mr. Xi, in turn, told Mr. Trump that <U+201C>facts have shown that cooperation is the only correct choice<U+201D> for the United States and China, according to Xinhua , the Chinese state news agency. In the phone call, which took place on Monday Beijing time, the two men agreed to maintain close communications and to meet at an early date. Despite the optimistic tone, analysts believe the relationship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi could grow tense if Mr. Trump follows through on his campaign promises, including a vow to impose a 45 percent tax on Chinese imports. Already, foreign policy experts in China appear to be nervous about the prospect of a trade war . An editorial on Sunday in Global Times, a Chinese newspaper known for its nationalistic views, said that trade would be <U+201C>paralyzed<U+201D> if Mr. Trump imposed such a tariff. The article threatened a <U+201C>tit-for-tat<U+201D> response, saying that sales of American cars, airplanes, iPhones and soybeans would suffer and that China could limit the number of students who go to the United States to study. <U+201C>Making things difficult for China politically will do him no good,<U+201D> the editorial said. <U+201C>Trump, as a shrewd businessman, will not be so na<U+00EF>ve.<U+201D> Mr. Trump is a longtime critic of American trade policies with Asian countries, and his pledge to rethink security commitments in Japan and South Korea has created uncertainty in the region. China, as a rising superpower, sees both benefits and potential dangers in Mr. Trump<U+2019>s leadership. Some analysts believe his focus on domestic issues might allow China to exert more influence in Asia and the Pacific. Others worry that he may abandon international agreements, such as a landmark accord on climate change reached last year. Li Yonghui, dean of the School of International Relations and Diplomacy at Beijing Foreign Studies University, said in an interview that Mr. Trump<U+2019>s emphasis on domestic affairs might help ease tensions between the two countries. But he added that Chinese leaders needed to prepare for the possibility that Mr. Trump might increase pressure on Beijing, for example, by imposing more restrictions on trade. <U+201C>He<U+2019>s very different from the Obama administration when it comes to issues like trade and economics,<U+201D> Mr. Li said. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s still a lot of uncertainty.<U+201D> Follow Javier C.

        "original_post": "Until recently, the United States had a firm policy of never paying ransom for hostages on the sensible view that it would encourage more kidnappings. Then came the Iran nuclear deal<U+2014>and a lesson in the human costs of President Obama <U+2019>s foreign policy. We say this following Tuesday<U+2019>s news that an Iranian court has sentenced Iranian-Americans Siamak Namazi and his 80-year-old father Baquer to 10 years in prison on trumped-up espionage charges. The younger Mr. Namazi, a businessman, was arrested last September, shortly after the nuclear deal was finalized. His father, a retired United Nations official, was arrested in February while visiting his son in prison. At least one other Iranian-American, Reza Shahini of San Diego, was arrested earlier this year, and former FBI agent Robert Levinson, who vanished in Iran in 2007, has never been accounted for. Tehran has a long history of imprisoning Iranian-Americans on spurious charges, often for domestic political reasons. But the $1.7 billion cash payment they received in January on the same day they released the last batch of U.S. hostages has created an incentive for them to imprison more Americans to trade for some future concession. The Obama Administration says the January payment was part of a legal settlement and in no way an act of ransom. The Iranians beg to differ, with defense officials telling Iranian media that the cash was a ransom payment. <U+201C>U.S. officials also acknowledge that Iranian negotiators on the prisoner exchange said they wanted the cash to show they had gained something tangible,<U+201D> Journal reporters Jay Solomon and Carol Lee reported in August. You can be sure Tehran will again demand <U+201C>something tangible<U+201D> the next time the fate of their American hostages reaches a negotiating table. It<U+2019>s worth noting that, prior to his arrest, Siamak Namazi was a strong advocate of closer U.S. economic ties to Iran, a view shared by his friends at the National Iranian American Council, a pro-Tehran lobby based in Washington. Mr. Namazi had publicly criticized U.S. sanctions against Iran. But the mullahs put their need for U.S. hostages above gratitude for such political assistance. Revolutions tend to devour their foreign sympathizers.",

        "original_post": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. <U+2014> With Democrats concerned about lagging early turnout among blacks and younger voters, President Obama on Wednesday began a three-day swing aimed at galvanizing a couple of the pillars of his political coalition in two states that could deny Donald J. Trump any route to the presidency. Mr. Obama is scheduled to appear in Chapel Hill, on the campus of the University of North Carolina, for an afternoon rally aimed at nudging college students and black voters in this heavily populated region to cast their ballot for Hillary Clinton . Then, on Thursday, he will head to Florida, where he will also press Democrats to vote early in two of that state<U+2019>s most heavily African-American cities: Miami and Jacksonville. If Mrs. Clinton captures both states, where polls show the race tightening, Mr. Trump would almost certainly be unable to amass the necessary 270 Electoral College votes to win the White House. Together, Florida and North Carolina have 44 electoral votes. But Mrs. Clinton has struggled so far to motivate black voters and millennials, two constituencies that played an important role in propelling Mr. Obama<U+2019>s victories in 2008 and 2012. In North Carolina, which Mr. Obama narrowly lost in 2012, black turnout is down 16 percent from where it was in the early vote four years ago. And aides to Mrs. Clinton estimate that the millennial vote in the state is also modestly off from where it was in 2012. Democrats have seen improvements in these numbers in recent days as more early voting locations have opened and they were able to drive African-American <U+201C>souls to the polls<U+201D> last weekend. But given Mr. Trump<U+2019>s appeal among working-class whites and a drift of some Republicans back to him in the race<U+2019>s final days, Mr. Obama could play a crucial role. After his visit in the Research Triangle area on Wednesday, he will appear in two cities with sizable black populations, Charlotte and Fayetteville, on Friday. Mr. Obama is also expected to spend much of the weekend stumping for Mrs. Clinton in what Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, on Tuesday called <U+201C>the last big campaign swing of his political career.<U+201D> Democrats are particularly focused in North Carolina on pushing blacks and millennials, who tend to be more transient, to vote early because of this state<U+2019>s election rules. Voters in the state can register and cast a ballot at any early voting location in their county. And if necessary, they can update their registration address. But if they have moved since the last election and show up to vote at the wrong precinct on Tuesday, they will not be allowed to re-register.

        "original_post": "World trade flows staged a partial rebound in the three months through September, even as concerns mounted over a possible increase in protectionism driven by voter resentment against job losses and weak earnings growth that many blame on three decades of accelerated globalization. During his campaign, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump pledged to introduce higher tariffs on imports from China and Mexico, and reassess other trade relationships that he said placed U.S. workers at a disadvantage. The CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis on Friday said the volume of world exports and imports in September was 0.4% lower than in August. But for the third quarter as a whole, trade flows were up 0.5% from the three months through June, having fallen by 0.7% during that period. The third-quarter increase means trade flows may rise over the year as a whole, but any increase is likely to be modest, maintaining the weak pace of expansion seen since 2011. But economic policy makers world-wide worry that a more dramatic swing toward protectionism could lead to even slower growth in coming years. European Central Bank Vice President V<U+00ED>tor Const<U+00E2>ncio said on Thursday that if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump pressed ahead with higher tariffs against some trading partners, retaliation would likely follow. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s very risky in a situation where world trade is already very weak,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>World trade and growth will suffer. The World Trade Organization has cut its forecast for world trade growth in 2016, saying it will be the slowest expansion since the global financial crisis, and warning that could weaken longer-term economic growth. The Geneva-based institution said government measures that restrict trade continue to rise around the world, and urged its members to remove barriers to imports. Businesses that facilitate trade are preparing for difficult times. <U+201C>Matters for trade are made far worse by political developments,<U+201D> said John Lori<U+00E9> , chief economist at Atradius, a firm that provides trade credit insurance. <U+201C>These are flatly trade-unfriendly, as signaled not only by the Brexit vote in the U.K., but also by the stalling of the regional trade liberalization efforts. Antitrade rhetoric by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump during the election campaign make matters even worse. The climate has changed; we will see that in future trade data.<U+201D> In the face of mounting hostility toward globalization in developed economies, free-trade advocates have acknowledged that the liberalization of trade and investment since the 1980s has been mishandled. <U+201C>We knew, from the outset, very well that trade created winners and losers,<U+201D> said Joakim Reiter , deputy secretary-general of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. <U+201C>But<U+2014>if we are honest<U+2014>we focused more on telling the story of the winners and neglected the story of the losers. And this omission has come to haunt us.<U+201D> Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "New York officials are investigating an envelope containing white powder that was sent to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton <U+2019>s campaign Friday, prompting the evacuation of one floor of her Brooklyn office. No injuries have been reported and preliminary tests showed the substance to be nontoxic, according to law-enforcement officials and a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign. The envelope was sent to Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s office on West 45th Street in Manhattan, where two interns opened it at about 5:30 p.m. Friday, according to law-enforcement officials. After noticing the powder, which was in a reclosable plastic bag, they brought the envelope to Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, officials said. Staff inspected its contents and alerted members of the Secret Service, who called 911. The New York Police Department<U+2019>s emergency-service unit responded and found no one experiencing adverse health symptoms, police said. The envelope was packaged and delivered to the city<U+2019>s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene for testing. Glen Caplin, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign, said the four people involved have reported no health issues and were released following full medical examinations. An NYPD handout on suspicious mail or packages advises people to leave the item where it was found and to call 911 immediately. The handout says the immediate area should be cleared and exposed persons isolated in a location away from the substance.

        "original_post": "WASHINGTON<U+2014>Aides to President-elect Donald Trump are considering Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) as a candidate for Treasury secretary, a pick that would bring an elected official with a free-market background and deep GOP ties into one of the cabinet<U+2019>s most powerful posts, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Hensarling, a former congressional aide who now represents the Dallas area, is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, a panel he has served on for more than a decade. He has pursued top Republican priorities, such as rolling back the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. People familiar with the matter said the transition process has only ramped up in recent days, and they are far from making final recommendations to Mr. Trump. Still, Mr. Hensarling<U+2019>s Texas roots could offer a sharp contrast to other potential nominees , particularly those with the kind of Wall Street ties that Mr. Trump railed about during the campaign. Mr. Hensarling said in an interview Thursday he would <U+201C>certainly have the discussion<U+201D> if the Trump administration came calling. <U+201C>But I<U+2019>m not anticipating the telephone call,<U+201D> Mr. Hensarling added. <U+201C>It is not something I<U+2019>ve indicated interest in. It is not something I am pursuing<U+2026>I think I<U+2019>m in a pretty good position now to advance the cause.<U+201D> Mr. Hensarling<U+2019>s consideration shows the strong influence Vice President-elect Mike Pence has on key decisions. Messrs. Pence and Hensarling worked closely together in the House of Representatives, and their views on many financial issues are closely aligned. Mr. Hensarling had backed Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) for president during the primary, but he later endorsed Mr. Trump and praised him for selecting Mr. Pence as his running mate. Mr. Hensarling has been a leading critic of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which finances U.S. exports. The Export-Import Bank<U+2019>s charter lapsed for nearly five months last year after Mr. Hensarling led a campaign to block its reauthorization. The bank has been unable this year to back deals larger than $10 million because the Senate hasn<U+2019>t filled vacant board positions. Mr. Hensarling also sought to pass legislation in 2013 that would phase out government-controlled mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a key piece of unfinished business from the 2008 financial crisis the Trump administration is likely to inherit. <U+2014>Nick Timiraos contributed to this article.

        "original_post": "This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. The plan that Donald Trump released during the campaign would cut taxes for the wealthiest households <U+2014> the top 0.1 percent of earners <U+2014> by $1.1 million a year on average. It<U+2019>s an astonishing number. A group that already makes an average of about $8 million a year would receive a 14 percent income boost, according to the Tax Policy Center . It would receive a raise larger than the total income earned by more than 99 percent of American households. Yesterday, however, Trump<U+2019>s choice for treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, effectively said to forget about his boss<U+2019>s campaign plan <U+2014> and that there would be no tax cut for the rich. <U+201C>Any reductions we have in upper-income taxes will be offset by less deductions so that there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class,<U+201D> Mnuchin said on CNBC . For good reason, a lot of people expressed skepticism about Mnuchin<U+2019>s statement. Slate<U+2019>s headline read: <U+201C>Trump<U+2019>s Treasury Pick Promises Not to Cut Taxes on the Rich. Ha. Haha. Hahahahaha.<U+201D> My Times colleague Neil Irwin archly explained that Trump<U+2019>s various promises <U+201C>will be hard to execute.<U+201D> Among the reasons for skepticism: Cutting taxes for the wealthy has been the Republican Party<U+2019>s highest policy priority for years, and Congressional leaders are unlikely to abandon it. The details of Mnuchin<U+2019>s comments are also questionable. Trump<U+2019>s proposed tax cut is so large that it<U+2019>d very hard to offset it by eliminating deductions. To believe Mnuchin, you have to assume the earlier tax plan is going to change radically. Of course, Trump and his advisers have shown a remarkable willingness to say whatever they think sounds best. So maybe we should ignore the latest statement <U+2014> or maybe we should ignore the detailed plan. We won<U+2019>t know until the Trump team begins work on actual legislation. But I think it<U+2019>s worth remembering that Trump does face a real dilemma . He won the presidency with the votes of large numbers of working-class voters. His original tax plan doesn<U+2019>t do much to help them <U+2014> indeed, probably hurts them, given the ways it will lead to cuts in programs that benefit the working class. Eventually, Trump is going to have to decide whether to pursue policies that help his political base. The initial statements of his top economic adviser suggest that the Trump team at least understands the dilemma. You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook .

But there<U+2019>s little evidence of a wholesale shift in the House landscape. The prospect [of] GOP voters staying home clearly increases the party<U+2019>s downside risk, but neither side<U+2019>s polling suggests the <U+201C>bottom dropping out<U+201D> for congressional Republicans.

The voters Trump has bled are the likeliest ticket-splitters. . . . Trump<U+2019>s ebb over the past few week has come disproportionately from traditionally GOP-leaning college-educated whites, particularly women. These voters seem to float in and out of the Trump coalition depending on whether Trump or Clinton is dominating headlines. Importantly, these suburban-dwellers are also the voters likeliest to stick with Republicans down-ballot because a) they are fundamentally Republicans b) they turn out at very high rates and c) they are likelier than other demographic groups to know who their local congressional candidates are.",

And for some New York and New Jersey voters, we have excellent candidates to suggest, too. President and Vice President Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine (D) NEW YORK STATE, poll hours: 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. United States Senate Chuck Schumer (D), senior senator, likely majority leader if the Democrats take the Senate, has it all over his opponent in experience, smarts and clout. House of Representatives District 1 (eastern Long Island): Anna Throne-Holst (D), right on gun control, climate change and education, unlike the incumbent, a hard-right Donald Trump supporter. District 3 (parts of Queens, Nassau and Suffolk Counties): Tom Suozzi (D), an experienced and gifted politician, longtime reformer with excellent ideas for saving the suburbs and fixing government. District 19 (Hudson Valley and the Catskills): Zephyr Teachout (D), the law professor who ran an impressive but unsuccessful campaign to unseat Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a voice for farmers and the environment, poised to be a national leader on her main issue: the corrosive effect of money in politics. District 24 (Syracuse area): John Katko (R), an independent thinker who bucks his party<U+2019>s destructive line on issues like immigration and the environment <U+2014> and, most important, on Mr. Trump. State Senate District 9 (Nassau County): Todd Kaminsky (D), a former prosecutor, now Assembly member, the perfect choice to replace the corruption-toppled Dean Skelos, one of the biggest symbols of all that<U+2019>s wrong with Albany. District 7 (Nassau County): Elaine Phillips (R), as Republican mayor of the village of Flower Hill, built a strong environmental record. NEW JERSEY, poll hours: 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. House of Representatives District 5 (parts of Bergen, Passaic, Sussex and Warren Counties): Josh Gottheimer (D), a former Microsoft executive and presidential speechwriter who promises to be civil and get things done, lacking his opponent<U+2019>s ultraconservative disdain for government.

        "original_post": "Whatever President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s policies bring about, the Treasury market<U+2019>s fever has finally broken. In the short time since Election Day, long-term Treasurys have experienced their swiftest setback in over seven years, with prices tumbling and yields shooting higher. The selloff reflects a view among many investors that Mr. Trump will usher in an era of stronger growth and higher inflation through a combination of increased spending, tax cuts and lighter regulation. The Trump trade may not persist; there are too many unknowns about his policies and how they will affect the economy. The rise in the dollar since the election , for example, could make import costs fall, weighing on inflation. Even if the market is wrong, the selloff has served as a violent reminder of the risks in the Treasury market. A look at the composition of the move up in yields suggests as much. Since the election, the yield on the 10-year note has risen to 2.34% from 1.87%. But nearly all of that increase appears to reflect an increase in term premiums<U+2014>the extra compensation investors demand to hold a longer-term bond to maturity versus what they estimate they could earn on a series of short-term securities over the same time frame. By the Federal Reserve Bank of New York<U+2019>s measure , the term premium on the 10-year Treasury had risen to 0.07 percentage points as of Thursday from minus-0.29 percentage points on Election Day. It is the first time since early January it has been in positive territory. Typically term premiums are positive, since investors tend to worry they are underestimating how high rates might go in the future. The term premium<U+2019>s unusual dip into negative territory this year suggested investors were worried that Treasury yields would fall further below their already extremely low level. That bet had paid off until just before the election, and it became a losing one with the victory of Mr. Trump. But the election has shaken that low-yields-forever sentiment, and investors won<U+2019>t soon forget the pain of their recent Treasury market losses. It could be a very long time before Treasury yields again plumb the lows they reached this year. Write to Justin Lahart at justin.lahart@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Sen. Charles Schumer, who is in line to become the Senate Democratic leader, is throwing his weight behind a progressive, Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, to be the next head of the Democratic National Committee, a spokesman said. The New York Democrat joins Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont<U+2014>whose Democratic primary challenge to Hillary Clinton energized progressives<U+2014>and liberal leaders in backing Mr. Ellison. Mr. Ellison has also won praise from Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a liberal icon, who said Thursday night on MSNBC that he would make a <U+201C>terrific DNC chair.<U+201D> The endorsements from those influential Democrats come at a time when the party is wrestling with an identity crisis and a leadership vacuum in the wake of the unexpected defeat of Hillary Clinton and the party<U+2019>s failure to win control of the Senate. Capital Journal is WSJ.com<U+2019>s home for politics, policy and national security news. Out of the wreckage of the election losses, the party<U+2019>s left wing is angling for an overhaul of the DNC and its leadership to make it more progressive and in tune with grass-roots activists. Many progressive groups have rallied behind Mr. Ellison, though he hasn<U+2019>t formally announced his bid for DNC chairman. He said in a Thursday night conference call with progressive activists that he would make an announcement on Monday. Mr. Ellison, an African-American Muslim, serves as co-chairman of the House Progressive Caucus and was an early backer of Mr. Sanders. He was first elected in 2006. Mr. Schumer<U+2019>s endorsement was first reported by Politico. The heavyweight endorsement and support of the progressive activists will make him a formidable candidate for the job. Also in the running for the job is former DNC Chairman Howard Dean, who said in a Thursday Twitter message that the party needs <U+201C>organization and focus on the young,<U+201D> as well as a strategy for competing in all 50 states. <U+201C>I am in for chairman again,<U+201D> he wrote. The new chairman, who will succeed interim head Donna Brazile, will be chosen at the next meeting of the DNC early next year. Progressive critics of the party establishment, including Sanders supporters, have been arguing that the DNC has become too much of a fundraising machine that isn<U+2019>t connecting with rank-and-file voters, and that contributed to the party<U+2019>s failure in the election. They have argued that the DNC should be more focused on grass-roots organizing. Asked about the DNC role in Thursday night<U+2019>s conference call, Mr. Ellison said, <U+201C>The key here has got to be a turnout-based, grass-roots-based Democratic Party that uses relationship building, one on one.<U+2019><U+2019> Mr. Schumer seemed to embrace that view of the DNC<U+2019>s changing role in backing Mr. Ellison. <U+201C>Without a Democratic White House, Schumer<U+2019>s view is the DNC is where grass-roots organizing in sync with legislative battles should be organized,<U+2019><U+2019> said Schumer spokesman Matt House.

        "original_post": "Donald J. Trump on Thursday accused Hillary Clinton of guiding a <U+201C>global power structure<U+201D> that has rigged the economy against the working class, language that some suggested echoed anti-Semitic themes. Mr. Trump made the accusation in a speech in West Palm Beach, Fla., in which he also defended himself against several accusations of sexual harassment, published by The New York Times and others. Early in the speech, he said that a global elite had <U+201C>stripped<U+201D> the United States of its wealth in order to line the pockets of corporate and political interests. <U+201C>The Clinton machine is at the center of this power structure,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>We<U+2019>ve seen this firsthand in the WikiLeaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends and her donors,<U+201D> he said, referring to the group that has, most recently, published thousands of hacked emails from Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign chairman. The remarks drew criticism from some who said they resembled prejudicial language used by anti-Semites. <U+201C>Whether intentionally or not, Donald Trump is evoking classic anti-Semitic themes that have historically been used against Jews and still reverberate today,<U+201D> Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, a group that fights discrimination, said in a statement. Mr. Greenblatt said the group feared that white supremacists might see the comments as tacit encouragement. <U+201C>Mr. Trump focused on the very issues and themes that obsess conspiratorial anti-Semites: They believe that there is an elite group of Jews who control the media, the government, and banking, and who are trying to destroy white America,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>They also believe that most of Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s donors are Jewish.<U+201D> The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Others drew a more direct comparison between Mr. Trump<U+2019>s words and those of anti-Semites. In the speech, Mr. Trump also accused the <U+201C>Clinton machine<U+201D> of wielding control over the news media, as well. <U+201C>The most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media, the press,<U+201D> he said to jeers from the audience. While the allegations were aimed at Mrs. Clinton, who is a Methodist, Jews have long been accused of conspiring to control institutions like banks and the media in order to amass wealth and power. In 1931, for example, the author A. N. Field described the creation of the American Federal Reserve as the moment the <U+201C>German-Jew engine of control<U+201D> enslaved the United States, according to the Anti-Defamation League. That conspiracy theory has survived the ensuing decades and, even today, such anti-Semitic beliefs remain prevalent around the world, according to A.D.L. polling . In West Palm Beach on Thursday, reporters covering Mr. Trump returned to a table reserved for the press to find a sign bearing a swastika and the word <U+201C>MEDIA<U+201D> scrawled on it, Jim Acosta, a senior CNN White House correspondent, reported .",

        "original_post": "The bar was low for Donald J. Trump after the worst two weeks for a presidential campaign in recent memory, and he seemed to clear it at Sunday<U+2019>s debate. Another decisive loss in a face-off with Hillary Clinton could have led to a mass revolt from Republican officials and raised the possibility of a landslide defeat in November. It<U+2019>s too soon to be sure that Mr. Trump staved off further defections from the Republican leadership. But if they abandon him, it will probably not be because of this performance. He did not do more damage beyond what was already done by a videotape that emerged on Friday, when Mr. Trump was heard bragging about groping women and getting away with it because he was a celebrity. Many commentators argued that Mr. Trump held his own Sunday night; some argued he won the debate outright. And his tactics <U+2014> intentionally or not <U+2014> probably made it harder for the Republican establishment to abandon him. He gave a lot of red meat to the G.O.P. base, calling Mrs. Clinton a liar and calling for her imprisonment. By energizing his supporters, he made it more challenging for Republicans to rescind their support. But Mr. Trump<U+2019>s performance did not seem strong enough to change the dynamics of a race that has moved sharply against him over the last few weeks. Mrs. Clinton had a considerable lead even before Friday. The Upshot<U+2019>s model gives him just a 17 percent chance of winning the election, based on pre-videotape and pre-debate polls. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s challenge got considerably worse over the weekend, after the release of the videotape led dozens of Republican officials to drop their endorsements. And he didn<U+2019>t seem to go out of his way Sunday to try to broaden his support. The post-debate polls suggest as much: According to the CNN poll, Mrs. Clinton won the debate, 57 to 34 percent. But 63 percent of voters said that Mr. Trump did better than expected. A YouGov poll found that Mrs. Clinton won the debate by five percentage points, but that she was more presidential by a margin of 57 to 31. Instant polls are not always especially representative of the electorate, but both findings tell two sides of the same story: Mr. Trump may have averted total calamity, but he did not do so well as to fundamentally alter the race. Mr. Trump needs something big to break his way, and soon. It is quite possible that the next set of polls will show him trailing by a large margin <U+2014> by more than the five- or six-point deficit he faced before the release of the videotape. It<U+2019>s hard to imagine that the polls will show Mr. Trump faring any better than he was ahead of that news. Needless to say, even if his deficit remained at five or six points, he would not be well positioned to win. If the polls show him slipping farther, he will need to make a bigger turnaround over the last month than any modern presidential candidate has been able to accomplish.

The president-elect has a long personal record of dealing with Muslim people and there isn<U+2019>t any racial stance documented against him. He<U+2019>s never been engaged in political or media campaigns against Muslims, whether American Muslims or Muslims outside the U.S., even following the phobia which spread after the September 11 terrorist attacks although Trump is a resident of the traumatized city of New York. Meanwhile, the stance against Muslims who are affiliated with terrorism and extremism must not be viewed as a racial stance. As Muslims, this is our position too. Those who want to confuse enmity towards extremism with enmity against Islam are ideological groups that sponsor terrorist ideology and they aim to lobby to serve their political purposes. Arab governments have plenty to do to communicate with the new administration in Washington after it<U+2019>s formed. . . . At the same time, we must not blame Washington and fail to see that most of our problems and issues are the product of our decisions and acts and that most solutions to them are in our hands.",

        "original_post": "As President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress decide the future of the Affordable Care Act, they ought to pay close attention to a survey published on Thursday that shows that a large majority of the country supports the law<U+2019>s most important provisions. Republican lawmakers and candidates have portrayed the 2010 law as an unmitigated disaster that must be repealed. But the new poll, which was conducted after the election by the Kaiser Family Foundation , shows that many Americans don<U+2019>t agree: 49 percent want the law expanded or implemented as it is and only 43 percent want it repealed or scaled back. What is most interesting about the Kaiser survey is that individual provisions of the law are extremely popular. For example, 85 percent of those surveyed like the provision of the A.C.A. that allows young people to stay on their parents<U+2019> health insurance plans until age 26; 80 percent support the subsidies the law provides to low- and moderate-income people who do not get insurance through employers; 80 percent are glad that the federal government helps states expand Medicaid to cover more poor people; and 69 percent like that the law prohibits insurers from denying coverage to people because of their medical history. Critics of the law will point out that only 35 percent of the people Kaiser surveyed supported the provision that requires nearly all Americans to have health insurance or pay a fine. It is not hard to see why this provision is unpopular: Many people do not like being forced to do things, even things that are good for them. But the insurance mandate is a linchpin on which the benefits of the A.C.A. depend. If people were not required to buy insurance, many young and healthy people would not buy policies until they felt that they needed health care. That would drive up the cost of insurance in aggregate because insurers and the government would be left covering mostly older and sicker people. Mr. Trump and Republican leaders in Congress seem determined to show their political base that they are going to repeal or substantially change the A.C.A.. But before they take a hatchet to the law, they should consider what most Americans think about what the law actually does.",

        "original_post": "NEWARK<U+2014>The George Washington Bridge lane-closure trial was delayed Thursday by a wrong time stamp on text messages used as evidence, the judge said. Assistant U.S. Attorney David Feder said Friday the delay stemmed from a glitch in the program that was used to extract text messages from a cellphone. This program didn<U+2019>t correctly process Daylight-saving time, he said. Michael Critchley Jr., who represents Bridget Kelly, said there was a specific text exchange with the wrong time stamp that would make it appear that Ms. Kelly had been lying when she said she had spoken to the governor<U+2019>s then-press secretary. <U+201C>[The jury would assume that] Ms. Kelly must have been lying when she said, <U+2018>I spoke to Mike,<U+2019><U+201D> Mr. Critchley Jr. said. The arguments also created a rare rift between defense attorneys for Ms. Kelly and Bill Baroni, who rarely publicly disagree. Michael Baldassare, who represents Mr. Baroni, argued Friday that fixing the time stamp on the text messages would hurt his client. <U+201C>The substance of testimony that is critical to our case will look wrong,<U+201D> Mr. Baldassare said. <U+201C>Both Mr. Wildstein and Mr. Baroni testified about it in a way that the time matters,<U+201D> he added, referring to David Wildstein, who has pleaded guilty and admitted to being the architect of the lane closures. The judge said she would read a statement to the jury explaining the time issue. Both sides moved for a mistrial, but the judge denied the motion. Ms. Kelly and Mr. Baroni, both former allies of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, are on trial for their alleged roles in creating traffic jams as political punishment. Closing arguments are expected to begin Friday, and jury deliberations are expected next week. Write to Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Donald Trump <U+2019>s fiscal splurge will revive the flagging confidence of U.S. consumers, and with it the global car industry. Or, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s isolationist stance on trade will hit the global car industry and its complex international supply chain. Both statements are defensible reactions to this week<U+2019>s U.S. election result . But they lead to radically different conclusions. This is the essential dilemma investors are likely to grapple with for the coming months<U+2014>and not just in the auto sector. Markets have taken Mr. Trump<U+2019>s pre-election talk of tax cuts and infrastructure spending to herald the kind of fiscal stimulus many economists have long seen as the answer to the world<U+2019>s sluggish economic growth. For all its irony<U+2014>and the opposition of fiscal hawks in Congress<U+2014>this outcome is likely to be popular, and Mr. Trump has a mandate to deliver it. Car sales are an obvious beneficiary. At the same time, the car industry is dependent on international trade deals attacked by the president-elect. Ford Motors , the company singled out by Mr. Trump , isn<U+2019>t the only one making major investments in Mexican manufacturing. General Motors and Fiat Chrysler both currently make more cars in Mexico than Ford. And, as UBS notes, BMW and Daimler<U+2019>s Mercedes<U+2014>which currently make all their North American cars in the U.S.<U+2014>are now investing heavily in Mexican factories. BMW<U+2019>s $1 billion new factory in San Luis Potosi will make up to 7% of the company<U+2019>s current global production when it opens in 2019. Another irony of the election result is that in the short term it has made Mexican factories even more efficient: The peso is still down about 8% against the dollar since Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory. There is a parallel here with Britain<U+2019>s vote in June to leave the European Union. For all the worrying about trade barriers, so far the main consequence of Brexit has been to devalue the pound and thus make BMW<U+2019>s Mini and Rolls-Royce plants in the U.K. more competitive. However, the peso will have to fall far further to make up for the 35% import tariff Mr. Trump has threatened to slap on Mexican car imports. So investors are left speculating just how far the reality of the president-elect will match the rhetoric. The president<U+2019>s luxurious personal tastes<U+2014>he is known to be a fan of Rolls-Royce, which manufactures exclusively in Southern England<U+2014>could point to a more nuanced approach than the one broadcast across the American rust belt. Which will win out: fiscal boost or protectionism? U.S. auto stocks have risen strongly since Tuesday, suggesting investors for now think the former. But stray words from the president-elect could swing the balance of sentiment either way. It would be rash to think markets<U+2019> current calm is definitive.",

Jessica Drake, who appears in pornographic movies, is the latest woman to publicly accuse the Republican nominee of unwanted sexual advances. The accusations, some dating back decades ago , have emerged in the final weeks of the presidential campaign. Mr. Trump has vigorously denied such claims. In a statement released Saturday, the Trump campaign called Ms. Drake<U+2019>s account <U+201C>totally false and ridiculous.<U+201D> At a press conference in Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon with her lawyer, Gloria Allred, Ms. Drake said she met Mr. Trump at a golf tournament while she was working a booth for Wicked Pictures, a California porn studio. The studio didn<U+2019>t immediately return a request for comment but features Ms. Drake on its website. Ms. Drake said Mr. Trump invited her to his suite one evening, where she arrived with two other women. <U+201C>He grabbed each of us tightly in a hug and kissed each of us on the lips without asking for permission,<U+201D> Ms. Drake said. She said Mr. Trump later called her and asked her to have dinner with him and invited her to a party. She refused but said he asked her, <U+201C>What do you want?

Ms. Drake didn<U+2019>t say what the money was for. When asked, Ms. Allred said in an email she had no comment. Ms. Drake provided a picture of herself standing next to Mr. Trump and smiling. The Trump campaign said the picture is <U+201C>one of thousands taken out of respect for people asking to have their picture taken with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump does not know this person, does not remember this person and would have no interest in ever knowing her.<U+201D> Ms. Drake said she isn<U+2019>t <U+201C>looking for monetary compensation<U+201D> or <U+201C>additional fame.<U+201D> <U+201C>I understand I may be called a liar or an opportunist, but I risk that in order to stand in solidarity women who share similar accounts that span many, many years,<U+201D> she said.

Ms. Allred hasn<U+2019>t filed any legal action on behalf of any of the women.

        "original_post": "Donald Trump this week released a video detailing the plans for his Administration<U+2019>s first 100 days, and one bright spot is his agenda for American energy. The President-elect promised to peel away government obstacles, and he will have plenty of work after President Obama<U+2019>s eight-year regulatory onslaught. <U+201C>I will cancel job-killing restrictions on the production of American energy, including shale energy and clean coal, creating many millions of high-paying jobs,<U+201D> Mr. Trump said in his two-minute clip. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s what we want, that<U+2019>s what we<U+2019>ve been waiting for.<U+201D> Here<U+2019>s one place to look: Last week the Obama Administration finished a five-year plan for offshore drilling contracts and canceled planned leases in the Arctic through 2022. That retreat is a reaction to protests from environmental groups, which melted down after a March Bureau of Ocean Energy Management draft included a sliver of drilling in the frozen North. Leases off the Atlantic Coast were already excluded, and green groups hope Mr. Obama will make these diktats permanent under an arcane clause of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. But that executive overreach is unlikely to stand up in court. Mr. Obama says there<U+2019>s no reason to drill in the Arctic because oil prices are so low, as if the government can predict energy prices five or 10 years from now. The Arctic region is thought to hold 90 billion barrels of oil, and up to 30% of the world<U+2019>s untapped natural gas. Exploration and drilling would create thousands of jobs, and most resources lie in relatively shallow waters fewer than 100 meters deep. Regulation is already crushing: A report last year by the National Petroleum Council noted that a company needs permits from some 12 federal and state agencies merely to dig an exploration well in the Arctic. Recall that Shell spent seven years and $7 billion trying to exploit leases it had already paid for off Alaska<U+2019>s Arctic coast before giving up . Russia is already exploring in the Arctic and won<U+2019>t be deterred by American moralizing. The Trump Administration may be tempted to cancel the Obama plan, but that would blow up leases in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska<U+2019>s Cook Inlet included in the outline. This means the new Administration would have to put out a new plan, say, for 2019 through 2024, that would supersede earlier orders. That will probably take at minimum 18 months, though both the Atlantic and Arctic regions have recently undergone environmental-impact evaluations, which should expedite the process. The Obama Administration intends to make these drilling regulations as calcified as possible, and the Arctic is the tip of the iceberg. But more than 85% of area offshore controlled by the federal government is closed to exploration. Mr. Trump can unlock this potential, which would be a gusher for global consumers and American economic growth.",

        "original_post": "After a relatively calm start to the final presidential debate on Wednesday, things took a turn for the nasty (with Donald J. Trump breaking in to call Hillary Clinton <U+201C>a nasty woman<U+201D> in one of the most-derided lines of the night). But perhaps we should have seen it coming. Not just because of his past behavior, but because it was signaled by those in the Republican candidate<U+2019>s corner. Which is to say: his family. Melania, Ivanka and Vanessa Trump <U+2014> the candidate<U+2019>s wife, daughter and daughter-in-law <U+2014> all wore black to the final debate, a departure from the colors they chose for earlier appearances, which tended to the light and bright. ( Melania Trump did wear black to the first debate, but it was an off-the-shoulder dress, so there was a lot of skin.) Given that candidates<U+2019> family members do not speak at debates, but are often featured in cutaway shots and the final exit, it is what they wear that speaks for them. Certainly, their choices were impactful enough that they did not escape viewers. Yahoo News asked , <U+201C>Was the third presidential debate on Wednesday, Oct. 19 more like a cocktail party or a funeral?<U+201D> Admittedly, it is possible the Trump team chose black because they wanted the focus to be on the candidate, and they did not want to call attention to themselves <U+2014> except that Ivanka Trump was wearing an asymmetric one-shoulder shirt by Roland Mouret, which is not exactly wallflower gear. And pants. And Melania Trump was not just wearing black, she was again wearing a pussy-bow blouse, a subject of much talk after the last debate because of her husband<U+2019>s vulgar taped comments, a fact that could not have escaped her or her handlers. Why she chose to double-down on the look <U+2014> whether to suggest that there was no implicit meaning\/slapping of her husband<U+2019>s hand in the choice, as so many commentators seemed to hope last time, or the opposite <U+2014> was unclear. But what was indisputable was that this time, Ms. Trump<U+2019>s look borrowed from the Clinton playbook, in that, according to Vogue , the pussy bow was on a jumpsuit (it wasn<U+2019>t quite a pantsuit, but close) by Ralph Lauren, who happens to have become Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s go-to designer . Indeed, the Democratic candidate was wearing a Ralph Lauren cream wool-crepe trouser suit on stage, which makes her three for three with the designer during the debates. Ms. Trump<U+2019>s choice came as something of a surprise to the Ralph Lauren folks, who had not worked with her on the look, and it also very effectively set up yet another opposition in an evening that was full of them (as the moderator Chris Wallace pointed out, the candidates did not agree on <U+201C>much<U+201D>). The visual takeaway was unmissable, no matter what your politics: black versus white. It doesn<U+2019>t get much starker than that, does it?

        "original_post": "If you believe U.S. corporations, Americans are drinking less coffee, eating fewer doughnuts and taking fewer cruises, all because of the presidential election. Companies have made a habit of finding excuses for their quarterly results. Blaming the weather is a perennial favorite. The fear of rising interest rates is another. Brexit is a newer culprit. Now,<U+00A0>Tuesday<U+2019>s<U+00A0>vote is front and center. Starbucks Corp. noted a <U+201C>high degree of uncertainty<U+201D> around the election. <U+201C>Everyone is hoping that postelection, there will be a return to a natural state of affairs in terms of consumer behavior,<U+201D> Chief Executive Howard Schultz said last week on an earnings call. People apparently were avoiding doughnuts and ice cream as well. Dunkin<U+2019> Brands Group Inc., the owner of Dunkin<U+2019> Donuts and Baskin-Robbins, said consumers were on edge because of <U+201C>the overwhelming dampening effect of the presidential election.<U+201D> McDonald<U+2019>s boss Steve Easterbrook said consumer confidence is muted. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re at a rather unusual stage of the election cycle,<U+201D> he said. And people apparently tend to book fewer cruises around presidential elections, according to Carnival Corp. chief Arnold Donald. At least 80 S&P 500 companies have mentioned the election in their conference calls so far this earnings season, according to John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet.<U+00A0>Surprisingly, though, that is down from 100 in the similar period before the far less contentious 2012 presidential election. About 40% of them this year have talked negatively about the election. Only one was outright positive<U+2014> Comcast Corp. , mainly because of political advertising. <U+201C>We have seen growth obviously in this election year,<U+201D> Comcast boss Neil Smit said. Companies from 10 of the 11 S&P 500<U+2019>s large-cap sectors have mentioned the election this reporting period, according to Mr. Butters. The telecom sector is the only one that hasn<U+2019>t, perhaps because people are talking and texting about the race. The question is whether these excuses are justified, or if they mask underlying fundamental issues. Shares of Starbucks, Carnival and McDonald<U+2019>s are all down for the year. Investors hoping for postelection rebounds once an element of certainty returns to the market might be disappointed. Blaming the election is akin to saying the dog ate<U+00A0>my homework.

        "original_post": "The political arm of Planned Parenthood is beginning a $30 million effort to encourage voters to turn out for the presidential contest and for Senate races in targeted states, a giant investment that is aimed at benefiting the Democrats in 2016. The director of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Deirdre Schifeling, called the work <U+201C>unprecedented<U+201D> for her group. The goal is to target millennial voters, and the organization has knocked on a million doors in Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Those are crucial battlegrounds in the presidential campaign, but also states with competitive Senate races, Ms. Schifeling said. There are 800 paid canvassers in the states and 3,500 volunteers, she said. <U+201C>The heart and soul of our program is a door-to-door, face-to-face canvass,<U+201D> she added. Their messaging includes informing voters of Donald J. Trump<U+2019>s comments on abortion.

        "original_post": "Boeing Co. said Friday that a planned facility to finish and deliver its best-selling 737 jetliners to Chinese customers would be sited at a new industrial development on Zhoushan island near Shanghai. The plans first announced last year for a plant to paint planes and install seats and other fittings such as in-flight entertainment systems has already stirred controversy after presidential candidate Donald Trump cited it as an example of U.S. jobs being moved overseas, prompting a sharp push back from Boeing. The aerospace company will continue assembling 737s at its plant near Seattle but send some planes to China for completion through a joint venture with the state-controlled Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd. A separate Boeing-owned delivery center in Zhoushan will oversee the handover of the completed planes. Boeing has previously said the China facility wouldn<U+2019>t cut employment on the 737 program in Washington state, home to its main assembly facilities. <U+201C>The Chinese government has identified Zhoushan and the region as a focus area for development in its 13th Five-Year Plan, and the facility will be an important part of that plan,<U+201D> Boeing said in a statement Friday. It gave no details about planned opening dates or employment. The new plant would mark a milestone for Boeing<U+2019>s presence in China, where rival Airbus Industrie SE already assembles some of its competing A320 jets at a factory in Tianjin. Airbus is also establishing one there to finish work on some A330 twin-aisle jets. Boeing announced its plan in September 2015 during a state visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to its Seattle factories that coincided with a proposed order for 300 planes. Boeing recently upgraded its forecast for China<U+2019>s plane demand to 6,800 new planes with a sticker price of $1 trillion over the next 20 years. Boeing and Airbus have a roughly 50\/50 split of the Chinese market and are deepening their ties with the country<U+2019>s aerospace industry. Write to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "A group of the world<U+2019>s leading experts in science, medicine and economics threw their support behind Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, endorsing the Democratic presidential candidate and arguing that her election is crucial for safeguarding freedom and preserving a constitutional government. The forceful endorsement came in a letter signed by 70 Nobel laureates hailing from a variety of fields and making the case that Mrs. Clinton is the candidate who best understands the importance of investing in science and technology at a time when the world faces challenges on several fronts. The letter made no mention of Donald J. Trump, but it suggested that policies that show a lack of appreciation of scientific knowledge could damage America<U+2019>s prestige and national security. <U+201C>We need a president who will support and advance policies that will enable science and technology to flourish in our country and to provide the basis of important policy decisions,<U+201D> they wrote. The Nobel winners included such prominent names such as the chemist Peter Agre, the economist Robert J. Shiller and the physicist Robert Woodrow Wilson. They pointed to global concerns such as cancer, Alzheimer<U+2019>s disease and climate change as problems that require American investment and innovation. Mr. Trump has described climate change as a <U+201C>hoax<U+201D> perpetrated by China. The fact that the Nobel laureates are backing Mrs. Clinton does not come as a big surprise, as academics overwhelmingly tend to lean Democratic. In 2012, 68 winners of the prize backed President Obama over Mitt Romney. Four years earlier, 76 winners supported Mr. Obama over Senator John McCain. This year, the group of luminaries made clear that the stakes of the election are especially high. <U+201C>The coming presidential election will have profound consequences for the future of our country and the world,<U+201D> they wrote.

The peso closed at 18.38 to the dollar in Mexico City, compared with 18.6485 Monday, a two-month high and far from the record low of almost 20 pesos to the dollar it hit in late September. Local equity prices also jumped ahead of U.S. election results, with the benchmark IPC index rising 0.9% to 48,470 points, its highest level in three weeks. Mexican assets took a roller-coaster ride in recent months, as the peso became a key emerging market proxy for the U.S. presidential election. Each time Republican nominee Donald Trump gained in polls, the peso took a beating against the dollar. Tuesday<U+2019>s broad gains <U+201C>reflected optimism over hopes that Mrs. Clinton would get to the White House,<U+201D> said Gabriela Siller, chief economist at local brokerage Banco Base. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s pledge to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement generated anxiety in a country that sends nearly 80% of its exports to the U.S. Mr. Trump<U+00A0>has also pledged to crack down on immigration and to build a wall in the U.S.-Mexico border<U+2014>and make Mexico pay for it. <U+201C>If Mr. Trump wins, it would be a Category 5 hurricane for the Mexican economy,<U+201D> Bank of Mexico Governor Agust<U+00ED>n Carstens said in a recent TV interview. Analysts expect the peso to further strengthen in coming days and puncture through key resistance levels if Mrs. Clinton wins the presidency. Nomura says the peso could reach 17.50 to the dollar next month under benign market conditions. The peso is the 10th most-traded currency and frequently used as a proxy to hedge global risks, according to the International Bank of Settlements. An average volume of around<U+00A0>US$112 billion is traded daily. It is also favored by investors because it trades globally around the clock, and Mexico<U+00B4>s orthodox central bank rarely intervenes in currency markets. In the past year, it has suffered multiple selloffs because of its liquidity and global prominence, from Britain<U+2019>s vote in June to leave the European Union to increasing expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year and, more recently, uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election.

        "original_post": "The rate of economic growth in developed countries doubled in the three months to September, figures from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development showed Monday, an indication that the global economy may be set for a modest pickup. The third-quarter rebound was led by the U.S. and Japan, while the U.K. and Germany slowed. Among members of the Group of Seven largest developed economies, the U.S. fared best, despite some uncertainty ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential elections. The OECD said the combined gross domestic products of its 34 members<U+2014>most of which are developed economies<U+2014>grew by 0.6% from the previous three-month period, compared with just 0.3% in the second quarter. That marked the fastest rate of quarter-to-quarter growth since the first three months of 2015. Compared with the same quarter of 2015, GDP was up 1.7%, with the U.K. growing most rapidly among G-7members, and Japan most slowly. Before the release of the third-quarter figures, the OECD had forecast that GDP in its members will rise by 1.8% in 2016, down from the 2.1% rate of expansion recorded in 2015. For 2017, the OECD and other international bodies expect a modest acceleration in global economic growth, supported by a revival in large developing economies such as Brazil and Russia that have contracted over recent years. But much will depend on the economic policies adopted by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Investors are anticipating a pickup in U.S. economic growth aided by increased spending on infrastructure projects and tax cuts. But during his campaign, Mr. Trump pledged to introduce new, higher tariffs on imports from China and Mexico , and reassess other trade relationships that he said placed U.S. workers at a disadvantage. If implemented, those measures would likely hurt growth in other parts of the world. Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com",

Still, uncertainty is likely to dominate global markets for months, causing asset prices swings over the next year, Mr. Mobius said. <U+201C>[Mr. Trump<U+2019>s] policies will be much more pragmatic and much more oriented to solutions that will benefit the U.S.,<U+201D> Mr. Mobius said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. <U+201C>If Trump is able to pull off a revival of the U.S. economy and growth, that of course will affect the entire world,<U+201D> he added. Currently about 60% of the money managed by Mr. Mobius is in Asia, 20% in Latin America and the rest in other countries, including East Europe. Mr. Trump has repeatedly accused China of being an unfair trading partner, and threatened tariffs on its goods. Still, Mr. Mobius says he is comfortable with his exposure to Asian markets and has no plans to dump holdings there. Mr. Mobius believes that with Mr. Trump at the helm, the international relations between the U.S. and emerging markets will tend to become <U+201C>more focused and realistic<U+201D> and the president will probably favor bilateral commercial agreements over multilateral ones, with more flexibility and reciprocity. He believes global investors in emerging markets will likely keep their money in those countries or even increase investments until the U.S. situation becomes more clear. The executive chairman of Templeton said Brazil may benefit from increased capital flows to emerging markets if the country continues with economic reforms. He said Russia may also gain with an improved relationship with the U.S., he added, if Mr. Trump pushes to lift sanctions imposed on Russia following its 2014 annexation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea. While markets and voters were taken by surprise by the result of the U.S. presidential election, Mr. Mobius says he was prepared for such an outcome because of the tight race between the Mr. Trump and his Democrat challenger, Hillary Clinton. Mr. Mobius said many polls didn<U+2019>t fully capture the dissatisfaction of Americans living in economically depressed rural areas and the U.S. Rust Belt. <U+201C>As you know, the U.S. economy is not doing very well [there]; Fed policies have not worked. I think there is need for change,<U+201D> Mr. Mobius said. Under Mr. Trump, the U.S. may correct some of its imbalances, according to Mr. Mobius. In his view, needed changes include cutting bureaucracy, lowering taxes and increasing interest rates. Write to Luciana Magalhaes at Luciana.Magalhaes@wsj.com",

Barack Obama used the last campaign appearance of his presidency as a rhetorical transfer of power to Hillary Clinton during a nighttime rally in Philadelphia that drew more than 30,000 people. The event included a blockbuster lineup of speakers, from the current president, first lady Michelle Obama, former President Bill Clinton and daughter Chelsea Clinton. <U+201C>She will work, and she will deliver,<U+201D> Mr. Obama said, introducing Mrs. Clinton, eight years after his historic election to the White House. <U+201C>But she will need your help.<U+201D> To punctuate his message, Mr. Obama made a point to forego protocol that dictates the president speak last, deferring that role to Mrs. Clinton. The president defended his former rival for the 2008 Democratic nomination against what he described as <U+201C>viscous, crazy attacks<U+201D> during the campaign, and said there has been a <U+201C>double standard applied to her.<U+201D> Mr. Obama was introduced by his wife, who has been a star surrogate for Mrs. Clinton, at time eclipsing her husband. <U+201C>In just a few hours we have the power to make her our next president,<U+201D> Mrs. Obama said of Mrs. Clinton as she thanked Americans for giving her, her husband and their daughters the opportunity to serve as the country<U+2019>s first family. The image of the Obamas and Clintons one by one taking to the stage on the eve of Election Day was the capstone of nearly a decade of an unlikely, and at times rocky, political bond between the two families. It also underscored the uniqueness of the 2016 election, with two first ladies and two presidents<U+2014>among them also a potential future female president and a potential future first gentleman<U+2014>standing shoulder-to shoulder. Mr. Obama urged his supporters not to stay home, but to turn out on Tuesday to elect <U+201C>the next president of the United States who happens to be a woman.<U+201D> <U+201C>We now have the chance to elect the 45th president<U+2026>who will finish the job,<U+201D> he said.

David Weinberger, a technology writer at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, said he and several colleagues were horrified by the vandalism and wanted to <U+201C>go high<U+201D> in response. <U+201C>Even though we disagree thoroughly with the Republican Party on most things, and with the North Carolina Republican Party especially,<U+201D> Mr. Weinberger said, <U+201C>that only made it seem like a better occasion to try to get past the political differences and to remember the democracy that unites us all.<U+201D> Mr. Weinberger said he has no connection to North Carolina, but was aware of a recent rightward swing in state politics, including a law requiring transgender people to use the public bathroom corresponding to the sex on their birth certificate. A<U+00A0>gofundme.com<U+00A0>fundraiser passed its goal of $10,000<U+00A0>in 40 minutes, and was closed, Mr. Weinberger said.

        "original_post": "On energy and environment issues, President-elect Donald Trump appears likely to spend the next four years working to unravel the expansive agenda President Barack Obama has cultivated. Most of the action out of the gate, and potentially for a long time, could involve rolling back regulations . Mr. Trump has said he would withdraw Mr. Obama<U+2019>s climate rule cutting power-plant carbon emissions, which is already facing a legal challenge that is almost certain to reach the Supreme Court. A federal appeals court decision on that regulation is expected in coming months, and a Trump administration could take the opportunity to opt out of defending the rule. Other regulations Mr. Trump<U+2019>s administration will likely reconsider include two that have been blocked for now by federal courts: an Interior Department rule setting standards for hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas wells on public lands; and an Environmental Protection Agency provision bringing more small waterways and wetlands under federal protection. Undoing regulations can be a lengthy endeavor and is often easier said than done. But a Trump administration could take a series of steps that collectively blunt the regulations, like starting a formal process to withdraw the them or relaxing the compliance requirements. Proactively, Mr. Trump has said he would revitalize the coal industry, but even coal executives have said market forces, namely cheap natural gas, make it hard for a president to help the coal industry in any substantial way. The president-elect has also said he would unlock vast reserves of oil and natural gas--although doing so risks undercutting his promise to help the coal industry, given the damage low natural gas prices are inflicting on coal companies. Mr. Trump has called climate change a hoax, and he has said he would review a 2009 scientific finding issued by the Obama administration that provides the legal underpinning for the outgoing president<U+2019>s regulatory approach to climate change. Such a move would surely be challenged in court and likely lose, but the mere act of reviewing the finding could cast a cloud of political uncertainty over the science of climate change, which most scientists agree is caused at least partly by humans<U+2019> burning of fossil fuels. Mr. Trump has also vowed to back out of a global deal addressing climate change and cut off U.S. aid to the $100 billion global climate fund to help poorer nations. He could not cancel the deal unilaterally, but he could begin the process of withdrawing the U.S., or he could establish a requirement that the Senate ratify the deal, which it would be unlikely to do.

        "original_post": "Did President Obama mislead the public about what he knew about Hillary Clinton <U+2019>s use of a private email server? That sounds possible based on the latest batch of WikiLeaks released Tuesday. In March 2015 Mr. Obama said in an interview that he found out about Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s use of a private email server <U+201C>the same time everybody else learned it, through the news reports.<U+201D> But we now know that answer alarmed Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s aide Cheryl Mills, who emailed adviser John Podesta the same day: <U+201C>We need to clean this up<U+2014>he has emails from her<U+2014>they do not say state.gov.<U+201D> So the President emailed with his Secretary of State over an address that wasn<U+2019>t on the official government network. Hmmm. <U+201C>The President did not suggest he hadn<U+2019>t traded emails with her,<U+201D> White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday in an attempt to explain the seeming contradiction. <U+201C>Of course the President had possession of Secretary Clinton<U+2019>s email address but he did not have any knowledge of where her server was located or what sort of arrangements had been made to store her email.<U+201D> We suppose a President wouldn<U+2019>t pay close attention to the email addresses of his cabinet officers, though that lack of state.gov sure was a red flag. The fact that he said he didn<U+2019>t know about the server may also have protected him from an FBI interview. In any case, the Cheryl Mills email is more evidence of the ethical messes that attend the Clinton entourage, as well as the perpetual need to <U+201C>clean this up<U+201D> without coming clean to the American people.",

        "original_post": "Donald Trump promised in his victory speech Tuesday that he will <U+201C>rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none.<U+201D> Allow us to suggest a great place to start: Approving the Keystone XL pipeline that President Obama rejected to satisfy his climate friends. TransCanada <U+2019>s Keystone could carry some 830,000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta to Nebraska, and the company said in a statement this week that it is <U+201C>fully committed<U+201D> to building the pipeline. TransCanada said that it is <U+201C>evaluating ways to engage the new administration on the benefits, the jobs and the tax revenues this project brings to the table.<U+201D> In 2015 TransCanada withdrew its route application after seven years of haggling with the Obama Administration, which rejected the pipeline despite favorable environmental reviews from its own State Department. President Obama said that approving Keystone would undercut U.S. <U+201C>global leadership<U+201D> on climate change. In other words, the President wanted leverage at the Paris climate drum circle<U+2014>and Keystone would enrage Democratic campaign donors like Tom Steyer. TransCanada has challenged the decision in federal court, and it is unclear if the company would be forced to restart the application process. Mr. Trump said in his campaign that he<U+2019>d approve Keystone, but has also demanded royalty payments, a demand he should drop. By the company<U+2019>s estimates the pipeline would add $3 billion to GDP, including millions in property taxes and create more than 40,000 jobs. Cost to taxpayers? $0. Keystone fulfills several of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s ostensible goals, including energy exploration. The pipeline could carry 100,000 barrels a day from North Dakota, which would encourage more development. And no one benefits more than America: 70% of refined products pumped through Keystone would stay in the U.S., according to a report last year from IHS, and that means consumers will enjoy lower prices. By the way, environmental objections were always bogus: Pipelines emit less carbon than rail systems and result in fewer spills. All of this is also true for the Dakota Access pipeline, which could carry 500,000 barrels a day from the Bakken Shale to Illinois. The builder altered the route in North Dakota some 140 times to placate concerns from environmental outfits and the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which sued. A federal judge ruled that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had met its obligations under the law. Yet the Administration disregarded the rule of law<U+2014>a judicial outcome in its favor<U+2014>and halted construction. For anyone mystified by Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory, these episodes are instructive: Progressives for eight years indulged the pipe dreams of wealthy environmentalists, even at the expense of growing the economy and helping middle-class Americans. Expedited approval for Keystone would be a down payment on the change in political culture that Mr. Trump has promised.",

        "original_post": "Donald Trump made fools of the pollsters and election prognosticators. His victory might make another group with an even worse track record look smart. Leading up to the election, the year-end stock market predictions for Wall Street<U+2019>s strategists were on track for being wrong yet again. The stock market was down for nine days in a row with little to get it rising again during the mediocre earnings season. The median S&P 500 year-end forecast among 19 equity strategists is 2175, with targets ranging from 2000 to 2300. The Trump rally put the index right at 2175 on Thursday afternoon. If the rally continues, Mr. Trump could do the nearly impossible<U+2014>make the perennially optimistic strategists actually underestimate the market . And while many incorrectly said a Trump victory would spark a short-term selloff, their longer-term prognostications remain on course. The hope is economic growth will pick up, inflation will rise and bond yields will hold at higher levels. While plenty can happen in the final seven weeks of the year, it is unusual for Wall Street strategists to get their year-end targets so right. From 2000 through 2015, the S&P 500 returned a 4% average annual gain , excluding dividends. By comparison, Wall Street strategists predicted 10% yearly returns on average across that span, according to research firm Birinyi Associates. There is evidence beyond the election that the strategists could end up underestimating the market. Even before the election, sentiment among individual investors appeared to be rising after being unusually sour for much of the past year. A weekly survey from the American Association of Individual Investors on Thursday showed the percentage of investors who say they are bullish surged to 39% from 24% a week earlier. That marked the biggest increase since July 2010 and the highest percentage of the year. The poll is administered each week from Thursday through Wednesday. AAII said roughly four-fifths of its most-recent results were recorded before the election. This week was the first time bullish sentiment exceeded AAII<U+2019>s historical average in 53 weeks. The reputation of pollsters was badly damaged by the election. Strategists have a far worse track record of predicting the future. Even if they get it right this year, their reputation won<U+2019>t likely improve.",

Allison and Atkins are formally interviewing for roles in the Trump administration.<U+00A0>Since winning the election, Mr. Trump has met with many people, some of whom were offered positions in his administration, including Education Secretary-nominee Betsy DeVos and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who was selected to be the ambassador to the United Nations. Mr. Atkins already has helped to oversee the Trump transition team<U+2019>s approach to financial regulation . He was appointed to teams that will meet with regulatory agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and gather information about pending policy matters that are important to the next administration. Mr. Atkins has been linked to potential jobs such as chairman of the SEC or vice chairman for supervision at the Federal Reserve. The latter role encompasses regulation of the nation<U+2019>s largest bank holding companies. Mr. Allison has written<U+00A0>that he would <U+201C> get rid of the Federal Reserve because the volatility in the economy is primarily caused by the Fed .<U+201D> He also advocated for raising bank capital standards but slashing many other <U+201C>burdensome<U+201D> regulations that came out of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.

        "original_post": "SYDNEY<U+2014>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand lowered interest rates Thursday, becoming the first central bank to respond to heightened global market volatility in the wake of Donald Trump<U+2019>s unexpected U.S. election win. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand<U+2019>s benchmark interest rate now sits at a record low of 1.75%, down from 2.0%. The move was expected by all 10 economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. RBNZ Gov. Graeme Wheeler made it clear he is worried about market instability and U.S. political upheavals, saying they could trigger further rate cuts. <U+201C>Political uncertainty remains heightened and market volatility is elevated,<U+201D> Mr. Wheeler said. <U+201C>Numerous uncertainties remain, particularly in respect of the international outlook, and policy may need to adjust accordingly.<U+201D> In addressing reporters later, Mr. Wheeler said the decision had occurred <U+201C>in light of the U.S. election results and reaffirmed that it was the right decision.<U+201D> The rate cut was well telegraphed to markets, with the RBNZ frustrated that consumer prices have refused to respond to repeated interest-rate cuts this year. Still, some economists said that the U.S. political shift would cement the case for lower rates. Citigroup economist Joshua Williamson said the RBNZ has adopted a <U+201C>Trump Put,<U+201D> meaning if economic conditions weaken due to uncertainty in the world economy, it can cut again. But in the absence of that downside risk, the RBNZ has indicated it doesn<U+2019>t need to cut further as the economy is growing solidly, he added. Donald Trump became the U.S. president-elect Tuesday, surprising pollsters who had widely predicted Hillary Clinton would instead be heading to the White House. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s win kicked of a wave of market instability as investors wait to see how he will govern. New Zealand<U+2019>s economy, which is commodity-based and highly reliant on trade, is in the firing line if global trade agreements are ripped up by the Trump administration. Inflation remains well below the RBNZ 1% to 3% target range at a revised 0.4% in the third quarter. But economic growth has accelerated, dairy prices are climbing, and unemployment has fallen to its lowest level in almost eight years. The New Zealand dollar was initially higher following the interest-rate cut, before falling back to be little changed. Write to James Glynn at james.glynn@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Markets are increasingly questioning the ability of central bankers to address the problems facing advanced economies. Investors should also consider that a world where monetary policy is less central may be even more uncomfortable. Central banks have held sway in markets . The introduction of quantitative easing in the U.S. halted the collapse of late 2008 and early 2009. Further rounds of QE and its widespread adoption, including by the European Central Bank, have powered markets onward, taking bond prices to dizzying heights. Markets are central to the implementation of monetary policy. Influencing asset prices is at the heart of the attempt to shift financing conditions to improve prospects for the real economy. Central bankers need to keep markets onside. Yet asset-price inflation hasn't delivered a powerful economic recovery. The persistent problems that many countries have faced since the global financial crisis are causing shifts in politics away from the established orthodoxy. From Donald Trump in the U.S. to the 5 Star Movement in Italy, politics is getting more volatile. The U.K. is a clear example. The Brexit vote was a rejection of the status quo that has caused politics to become the primary consideration for investors. Look at the value of sterling , which until this year was driven largely by expectations of changes in U.K. monetary policy relative to policy elsewhere. The regime shift has been seismic, in part because the U.K. was previously a highly conventional, market-friendly economy. Even less dramatic shifts than Brexit, such as the much-discussed move to make greater use of fiscal policy, will change the terms of engagement for investors. Financial markets may no longer be <U+201C>front and center,<U+201D> asset allocation strategists at HSBC think. They will be more the reflection of policy rather than the target of it. That may sound like a subtle distinction, but it is a potentially important one. A world centered on central banks offers a great deal of opportunity for careful communication tailored to investors. The flow of information is organized, with calendars of meetings, news conferences and speeches, reams of research and publications. Investors can obsess over tiny shifts, for instance in the Federal Reserve<U+2019>s so-called dot plot. Monetary policy tends to work incrementally and involve a great deal of signaling. Politics can be far messier. Markets will be keenly interested in fiscal policy, but may also have to cope with accompanying shifts on trade, immigration and industrial policies. Decisions may be less timely, and market expectations and responses less important, unless they are extreme. Central banks have fixed mandates, but the political script can be rewritten rapidly. The shift away from the established economic and political order increases the risk of outcomes for which markets aren<U+2019>t prepared. Investors might feel frustrated at the way that central banks have come to dominate markets. But politics may make predictable returns harder to come by.

        "original_post": "Vox Media has plans to bring one of its web video stars to television. The digital publisher is in advanced talks with a cable entertainment network for a TV special next year starring Liz Plank, who joined Vox.com earlier this year to launch comedic election web series <U+201C>2016ish,<U+201D> according to people familiar with the matter. Vox Media, which owns sites such as Vox.com, the Verge, SB Nation and Eater, last year secured a secured a $200 million investment from NBCUniversal . However, the network that is in talks for Ms. Plank<U+2019>s program is not in the Comcast -owned TV giant<U+2019>s portfolio of cable channels, the people said. Vox is on the hunt for an executive producer\/showrunner to launch a digital series starring Ms. Plank, 29, who is a regular presence on MSNBC and previously worked at millennial-geared publisher Mic. While it<U+2019>s unclear just how linked the web series will be with the TV project, the showrunner will also lead creative development on a television pilot with a <U+201C>major cable network,<U+201D> according to a job posting . Vox is hoping that the digital series and TV special will build up more interest among TV networks for a permanent show hosted by Ms. Plank, according to a person familiar with the plans. The move comes as more internet publishers, from Vice to BuzzFeed to Refinery29, link up with traditional media companies to push into television. The yet-to-be-named digital show and TV special may experiment with different formats, but one person described the effort as a <U+201C>feminist <U+2018>Chappelle<U+2019>s Show<U+2019><U+201D> involving socially-conscious sketch comedy. Ms. Plank<U+2019>s <U+201C>2016ish<U+201D> series has accumulated more than 77 million views on Facebook, according to Vox. On a recent episode, she and comedian Casey Jost don varsity jackets and joke about Donald Trump <U+2019>s <U+201C>locker-room talk.<U+201D> After Mr. Trump called Hillary Clinton <U+201C>a nasty woman <U+201D> during the third presidential debate Wednesday night, Vox on Thursday posted a video where Ms. Plank stars in a black-and-white mock advertisement for <U+201C>Nasty Woman<U+201D> perfume. <U+201C>Because a woman<U+2019>s place is in the kitchen<U+2026>of a restaurant that she independently owns and operates,<U+201D> Ms. Plank says in a voice-over. <U+201C>Get what you want: maternity leave.<U+201D> (It is from the makers of Bad Hombre for men, the video says.) <U+201C>We find really talented folks and try to build a platform for them to do the best work possible, no matter what platform that<U+2019>s on,<U+201D> said Melissa Bell, publisher at Vox Media. The company<U+2019>s TV ambitions are still in the early stages. In May, Vox announced a new show on A&E Networks-owned FYI called <U+201C>Prefabulous<U+201D> in collaboration with its real estate site, Curbed. Since the investment, Vox and NBCU have teamed up on a joint advertising sales initiative called Concert, and reporters at the Verge and Recode, tech sites owned by Vox Media, make regular appearances on CNBC.

        "original_post": "In the world according to Peter Thiel, the technology entrepreneur and billionaire, liberals and journalists are easily distracted children. Preoccupied with the words that come out of Donald Trump<U+2019>s mouth, they are not taking <U+201C>seriously<U+201D> the Republican candidate<U+2019>s diagnosis of what is hurting the country: wars, trade and government regulations. Speaking on Monday at the National Press Club in Washington, Mr. Thiel argued that Mr. Trump was the best choice in the presidential race because he will not get the country into wars, will fix the problems caused by international trade and will remove government regulations that are hurting the economy. Americans should focus on that big picture, Mr. Thiel argued, rather than taking <U+201C>literally<U+201D> everything Mr. Trump says. <U+201C>What Trump represents isn<U+2019>t crazy and it<U+2019>s not going away,<U+201D> Mr. Thiel said. Going by Mr. Thiel<U+2019>s logic, we should ignore Mr. Trump<U+2019>s reckless statements about using nuclear weapons . We should not worry that the candidate has claimed to know more about the Islamic State than the generals. Forget his proposals to boost the size of the armed forces, and that he said he was <U+201C>the most militaristic person there is.<U+201D> Instead of bothering ourselves with Mr. Trump<U+2019>s statements, Mr. Thiel said we should worry that Hillary Clinton could escalate tensions with Russia because she might try to enforce a no-fly zone in Syria. In other words, don<U+2019>t pay attention to what Mr. Trump says but definitely be very concerned about what Mrs. Clinton says. Mr. Thiel, a libertarian who has taken many controversial positions, has supported Mr. Trump for months now. He spoke at the Republican National Convention on the same night as the candidate. Recently, Mr. Thiel revealed that he was giving $1.25 million to support Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign, a donation that many in Silicon Valley have criticized . As he did in his speech at the convention, Mr. Thiel on Monday painted a dystopian picture of the economy, which he said had been devastated by the technology bubble of the 1990s and the housing bubble of the last decade. He appeared to blame the problem on government regulations and said Mr. Trump understood that and knew how to fix it. But Mr. Thiel offered no evidence to back up that claim. In fact, Mr. Trump himself has engaged in the kinds of speculative investments and profligate use of debt that contributed to an earlier real estate bubble in the 1980s. Mr. Thiel also misunderstands what led to the technology and housing crises he laments. The excessive lending and irrational exuberance in those industries was caused in large part by the lack of effective regulations and enforcement. But as Mr. Thiel said, this is not the time to get bogged down in details. Let<U+2019>s focus on the big picture. Vikas Bajaj is a member of the editorial board.",

Messrs. Obama and Putin had spoken before the Nov. 8 election, after the U.S. accused the Russian government of using cyberattacks to try to influence the outcome of the presidential race. Mr. Putin had favored Donald Trump in the election, while Mr. Obama campaigned vigorously for Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory has raised the prospect of a shift in U.S.-Russia relations. Mr. Obama said he urged Mr. Putin to instruct his aides to work with the U.S. and Europe to finally resolve the issue of Ukraine. He said he told Mr. Putin the goal is <U+201C>to see if we can get that done before my term is up.<U+201D> He said he also told Mr. Putin he is <U+201C>still deeply concerned about the bloodshed and chaos<U+201D> that<U+2019>s being caused by attacks on Aleppo. He said it was <U+201C>a candid and courteous<U+201D> discussion. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the two leaders <U+201C>expressed regret that it was not possible to make progress in Ukraine,<U+201D> but added that the remaining months of Mr. Obama<U+2019>s presidency should be used to pursue a resolution of the Syrian crisis, the news agency Interfax reported. Earlier this week, while in Germany, Mr. Obama and European leaders agreed to maintain economic sanctions against Russia for its intervention in Ukraine. Mr. Obama said the U.S. had <U+201C>very clear proof<U+201D> that Russia was behind cyberattacks during the presidential campaign. <U+201C>I<U+2019>ve sought a constructive relationship with Russia, but what I have also been is realistic in recognizing that there are some significant differences in how Russia views the world and how we view the world,<U+201D> Mr. Obama said at a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. <U+201C>And my hope is that the president-elect coming in takes a similarly constructive approach, finding areas where we can cooperate with Russia where our values and interests align, but that the president-elect also is willing to stand up to Russia where they are deviating from our values and international norms,<U+201D> Mr. Obama said.

        "original_post": "Infrastructure projects backed by state ballot initiatives and higher gasoline taxes will drive a surge in domestic spending even before any bump from the new administration<U+2019>s spending pledge, the chief executive of Aecom said Monday. Michael Burke said voters last week passed $200 billion in infrastructure projects being tracked by the Los Angeles-based company that are expected to spur rapid growth in 2018. President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s election-night focus on boosting spending on domestic infrastructure drove a rally in construction-related stocks last week that continued Monday, despite uncertainty over the incoming administration<U+2019>s specific funding plans and priorities. Mr. Burke said expected changes in energy policy were expected to reverse some of the weakness in segments such as pipelines, but state-funded projects already provided reason for optimism. <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t think we<U+2019>ve ever been more bullish on the future of infrastructure in North America,<U+201D> Mr. Burke said on a call after Aecom reported quarterly profits that undershot analysts<U+2019> expectations alongside guidance for next year that also fell short. State and local spending typically accounts for 75% of the public sector share of domestic infrastructure investment in projects such as roads and water treatment facilities, with the federal budget paying for the balance. Mr. Trump had pledged on the campaign trail to invest $1 trillion over 10 years on a variety of infrastructure projects if elected, and analysts said his win could ease the passage next year of an infrastructure spending bill already being considered by Congress. The plans hinge on unlocking more private sector spending that is dependent on establishing revenue streams such as road and bridge tolls to pay down debt as well as securing regulatory approvals and public sector contributions. Aecom shares climbed after Mr. Burke<U+2019>s remarks, having nursed an early loss following the 2017 guidance. Shares were up more than 6.4% at $34.29 in Monday afternoon trading. The company forecast adjusted profit in 2017 in a range of $2.70 to $3.10 a share, compared with the consensus estimate from analysts of $3.24 a share, according to FactSet. Fourth-quarter profits rose to $7.2 million, or a nickel a share, up from $1.1 million, or a penny a share. Revenue fell to 8% to $4.3 billion. Mr. Burke said Aecom<U+2019>s $6.3 billion in contract wins for the quarter, including work on the new stadium for the Los Angeles Rams football team, were a record. The company<U+2019>s results in its year ended in September were hurt by <U+201C>uneven client spending<U+201D> in Aecom<U+2019>s Americas business, Mr. Burke said, as well as pressures from low oil and gasoline prices. Mr. Burke also blamed underwhelming performance on less-than-expected earnings contributions from sizable power and industrial construction wins in the second half of the year, because of timing.

        "original_post": "President-elect Donald J. Trump <U+2019>s wife, Melania, and their 10-year-old son, Barron, will not immediately move to the White House after Mr. Trump takes office in January, out of concern for uprooting Barron in the middle of the school year, transition officials said on Sunday. Ms. Trump and Barron will remain in New York for at least another six months, the officials said. Speaking to reporters on Sunday at his golf course in Bedminster, N.J., Mr. Trump said they would join him <U+201C>very soon <U+2014> after he<U+2019>s finished with school.<U+201D> Mr. Trump said he would move to the White House. Still, with his family remaining at Trump Tower, the likelihood may increase that Mr. Trump will spend part of the week in New York. Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, said, <U+201C>No official statement has been released by the Trump family regarding transition timing, but like any parents, they are concerned about pulling their 10-year-old son out of school in the middle of the year.<U+201D> Mr. Miller urged that <U+201C>the same privacy and security considerations given to previous first families with regard to minor children be extended to the Trumps as well.<U+201D> The New York Times previously reported that Ms. Trump was planning to move to the White House eventually but was concerned about disrupting her son<U+2019>s routine. The New York Post reported on Sunday that she and Barron would not join her husband immediately after the inauguration. For all of the enthusiasm that the president-elect displayed on the campaign trail, Ms. Trump, a former model, never shared in it. She did not join her husband other than for major events like the Republican National Convention, and she granted few interviews. She is the main caregiver for their son, who attends a private school in Manhattan and is taken there most days by his mother. She is said to be concerned not just about the potential disruption to her son<U+2019>s life, but also about bringing him closer to the news media spotlight. People who know her have said she plans to revisit the issue at the end of the school year. The situation is similar in ways to the one Michelle Obama faced in 2008 after her husband was elected. Mrs. Obama also did not care for the attention that came with the campaign, and she was said to be considering remaining in Chicago with their two daughters. But she ultimately made the move with their children. Mr. Trump and his aides have not said whether he plans to move to the White House full time. But he has told aides he would like to be in New York when he can. Keeping Trump Tower as a residence for the incoming president<U+2019>s family will create security and logistical hurdles for the Secret Service and the Police Department. The tower is on Fifth Avenue, a major thoroughfare.

        "original_post": "TOKYO<U+2014>Japan<U+2019>s economy grew more quickly than expected in the third quarter, marking the third straight quarter of expansion, but the upbeat figure masked continued sluggishness in spending at home. Gross domestic product expanded at an annualized 2.2% pace in the three months through September, the government said Monday, higher than the 0.9% rise expected by economists. It was the longest stretch of growth since 2013. The surprise was driven by a rebound in exports, which rose 2% compared with the previous quarter. Shipments of smartphone components including semiconductors rose, according to the Cabinet Office. Domestic indicators told a different story. Both household spending and capital investment, which together account for roughly 70% of GDP, were flat on quarter, despite efforts by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to get companies to spend more of their cash piles. <U+201C>The Abe government has been trying to achieve domestic-led growth, but the third quarter GDP shows that the growth is reliant on exports,<U+201D> said Shunsuke Kobayashi, economist at the Daiwa Institute of Research. Mr. Abe has tried to lift growth with a combination of monetary and fiscal stimulus since taking power in late 2012, but growth has since been uneven. He recently introduced a new package of government spending and other stimulus measures. Economists say that households are still hesitant to spend because many workers haven<U+2019>t seen significant pay increases. Fast Retailing Co., the operator of Uniqlo clothing stores, said last month that profits improved in the six months through Aug. 31 after it held off raising prices. Upscale department stores have seen sales fall in recent months as consumers put off luxury purchases. Businesses likewise held back from spending as a stronger yen weighed on repatriated profits. Among the brighter spots were private housing investment, which rose 2.3% compared with the previous quarter, and a continuing rise in tourism. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has expressed opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade deal , one of Mr. Abe<U+2019>s main initiatives to lift Japanese exports. <U+201C>The government should take steps to ensure the growth in exports will persist. With the election of Trump as president, the TPP has become difficult, but there are other free trade initiatives Japan can push forward,<U+201D> said Daiwa Institute of Research<U+2019>s Mr. Kobayashi. Japan<U+2019>s economy is expected to continue its gradual recovery, said economy minister Nobuteru Ishihara in a statement Monday, citing <U+201C>improvements in employment and wage conditions.<U+201D> Toru Suehiro, economist at Mizuho Securities, said the government would likely hold off from seeking further stimulus after a third straight quarter of expansion and the recent fall in the yen, which helps Japanese exporters. <U+201C>Since the U.S. presidential election, the upward pressure on the yen has receded. This must have helped ease the worries of the government,<U+201D> Mr. Suehiro said. Write to Eleanor Warnock at eleanor.warnock@wsj.com and Mitsuru Obe at mitsuru.obe@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Ohio Sen. Rob Portman raised $4.5 million from July through September, his campaign announced, a strong haul that positions him well for the last stretch of his competitive Senate race. Mr. Portman raised $3.5 million of the haul for his own campaign and an additional $1 million for a joint fundraising committee with the Ohio Republican Party, which is working to secure a win both for him and GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump . Mr. Portman will report holding $7.6 million in the bank as of<U+00A0>Sept. 30, a war chest that will allow him to support an advertising blitz in the last weeks of the campaign. Former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, Mr. Portman<U+2019>s Democratic rival, hasn<U+2019>t yet reported his third-quarter fundraising totals. From April through June, Mr. Portman<U+2019>s fundraising outpaced Mr. Strickland<U+2019>s, with the Republican bringing in $2.9 million to Mr. Strickland<U+2019>s $1.9 million. Mr. Portman, who was first elected to the Senate in 2010, has long been considered one of this year<U+2019>s most vulnerable Republican incumbents. The GOP is defending nine Senate seats in states President Barack Obama has won, and Democrats must win just five back to regain a majority in that chamber. But over the summer, the race has moved decisively in Mr. Portman<U+2019>s favor. His campaign has run an extensive ground operation that analysts from both parties praise as particularly thorough. Volunteers for the campaign have spoken to more than four million individual voters, according to a campaign spokeswoman. Mr. Strickland, once thought to be a top recruit for the Democrats, hasn<U+2019>t been able to pull even with Mr. Portman in polls of the race. Mr. Portman currently leads Mr. Strickland by 13 points , according to the Real Clear Politics average. Sensing the race slipping from their grasp, Democratic groups, including the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and an allied super PAC, Senate Majority PAC, have pulled at least $7 million in advertising as of late last week. Equivalent GOP outside groups have also pulled money from the state, to redirect funds toward other competitive races, including North Carolina and Missouri.",

        "original_post": "Donald J. Trump <U+2019>s foundation informed Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman of New York that it has ceased soliciting donations in the state, after a recent order to halt such fund-raising efforts, a spokesman for the attorney general<U+2019>s office said on Monday. The charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, also requested and was granted an extension for filing its financial paperwork, including audits, said Eric Soufer, the spokesman. The developments come about two weeks after the attorney general<U+2019>s office ordered the foundation to stop soliciting charitable contributions in the state of New York, saying that the nonprofit was not properly registered to do so under state law. A <U+201C>notice of violation<U+201D> letter sent to the foundation on Sept. 30 required it to submit financial documents within 15 days, or <U+201C>be deemed to be a continuing fraud upon the people of the state of New York.<U+201D> The foundation has become a source of controversy during Mr. Trump<U+2019>s presidential campaign amid reports about questionable expenditures, doubts about whether he followed through on charitable pledges and his own lack of financial support for the charity. <U+201C>The Trump Foundation is cooperating with the office of the N.Y. A.G. in its investigation of the foundation and, given the scope of the N.Y. A.G.<U+2019>s requests, is working with the N.Y. A.G. to respond in a reasonable and timely manner,<U+201D> said Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign has dismissed the criticism of the foundation, saying he has provided ample support to worthy causes over the years, both through the charity and directly. Ms. Hicks has previously said he is concerned about the <U+201C>political motives<U+201D> behind the attorney general<U+2019>s investigation. Mr. Schneiderman, a Democrat and supporter of Mrs. Clinton, has tangled with Mr. Trump over other matters, including his high-profile lawsuit alleging that students were defrauded out of thousands of dollars at Mr. Trump<U+2019>s for-profit education program, Trump University.

        "original_post": "SEATTLE<U+2014>Thousands of middle- and high-school students across Seattle walked out of classes Monday to protest President-elect Donald Trump. Teens from public and private schools chanted <U+201C>We reject the president-elect,<U+201D> among other statements as they marched in the streets of the Capitol Hill and downtown neighborhoods. Many waved signs that read <U+201C>Not My President<U+201D> or <U+201C>Love Wins.<U+201D> A spokesman with Seattle Public Schools estimated that more than 5,000 students from 20 middle and high schools participated in the walkout. Students who left class will get an unexcused absence, spokesman Luke Duecy said. Some who joined the march said they oppose Trump<U+2019>s divisive rhetoric and wanted to show support for those he targeted, such as Muslims or immigrants. Others say they came to support their friends or simply to observe the activities. High school senior Rose Taylor, who is bisexual and voted for Hillary Clinton, said she worries about what Trump<U+2019>s election will mean for the LGBT community and others. <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t believe Donald Trump is going to make a good president,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m worried about what<U+2019>s going to happen to my community and my friends.<U+201D> Marci Owens, 17, a transgender high school senior, wasn<U+2019>t able to vote, but she turned out Monday to show solidarity with others. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m more afraid about the division that it<U+2019>s created,<U+201D> said Owens, who is black. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m worried about people who are attacking other people. That<U+2019>s scarier than what Trump has to say.<U+201D> Seattle Mayor Ed Murray tweeted his support for the students Monday afternoon, saying he applauds them for taking a stand for inclusiveness. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s important their peaceful voices be heard. Let<U+2019>s look out for each other & be safe,<U+201D> he said. About 5:30 p.m., Seattle police on Twitter said officers arrested two men, who weren't students of Seattle schools, in connection with the demonstration. Police said the men were arrested for assaulting officers. No further information was given on the assaults. Aside from the arrests, police said the demonstration continued to be peaceful. <U+2014>Copyright 2016 Associated Press",

Last summer, in the innocent time before sexist comments from Donald Trump had become a near daily occurrence, he vulgarly insulted Megyn Kelly of Fox News, with a reference to <U+201C>blood coming out of her wherever.<U+201D> Hours later, the conservative activist Erick-Woods Erickson disinvited Trump from the annual gathering that Erickson hosts. He invited Kelly (with whom he had previously clashed ) in Trump<U+2019>s place. The reason was simple, Erickson said: Decency. It is a standard that few Republican leaders have met this year. Even as Trump has unfurled one form of hateful language after another <U+2014> even as he has bragged about sexually assaulting women <U+2014> most Republican leaders have stood with him. In today<U+2019>s Times, Erickson has written an Op-Ed calling out those leaders, including pastors, and noting the personal price his family has paid for his willingness to confront Trump. In the article, Erickson also charts a post-Trump path for the party. It<U+2019>s a serious one, organized around school choice, market-based economics, religious freedom and local communities. But I think it<U+2019>s also missing at least one big item: equality of all Americans. Today<U+2019>s Republican Party is built in part on fear of people who are not white. There<U+2019>s no other way to say it. The party is committed to reducing voting rights for African-Americans. It has a history of alienating African-Americans that long predates Trump, stretching through Richard Nixon , Ronald Reagan , George H.W. Bush , George W. Bush and Mitt Romney . Lately, it has begun alienating Asian-Americans and Latinos as well. Obama won at least 70 percent of each group in 2012. I<U+2019>m willing to guess Hillary Clinton will do even better this year. I understand that many conservatives see themselves as inherently supportive of equality for all Americans <U+2014> so supportive that they don<U+2019>t like to mention race (or gender) and foster divisions in the process. But their party is not starting from scratch. It needs to overcome a long history of discrimination. And in 2016, it seems to be losing more ground every week. Thoughtful conservatives, like Erickson, need to start pushing for a radically different approach. You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook .

        "original_post": "MetLife was smart on Thursday to warn investors not to get too excited about its stock. MetLife shares have risen strongly since Donald Trump <U+2019>s surprise election victory on Tuesday. Investors are reacting to rising interest rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond has risen to 2.12% late Thursday, from 1.85% on Tuesday. That is good news for insurance companies because it means they can earn more by investing customers<U+2019> premiums over time. MetLife added fuel to the rally Thursday by announcing that its board has approved $3 billion for share repurchases. MetLife shares rose in afternoon trading. But the company tempered the mood in its comments at an investor-day event Thursday morning, saying return on equity, a key measure of profitability for financial companies, still faces headwinds. <U+201C>Never before in history has the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury been as low as it was post-Brexit, at 1.36%,<U+201D> said MetLife Chief Executive Steven Kandarian. Though they have risen since then, interest rates remain at very low levels. The 10-year Treasury still yields less than the 2.30% it paid at the end of last year. Rates could also shift lower on any bad news, such as new tensions with China or Mexico. As long as rates remain as low as they are, the company will face pressure on ROE. From 2011 through 2015, when rates were higher, MetLife earned an average, adjusted, operating<U+00A0>ROE of 11.3%, excluding some one-time gains and losses. MetLife said Thursday it has historically been able to earn an adjusted ROE that is 8.4 percentage points above the 10-year yield. With the 10-year yield currently at 2.12% this suggests a possible ROE of 10.5%. From investors<U+2019> standpoint, that is adequate but not great. Financial institutions are generally thought to be underperforming if they can<U+2019>t do better than 10%, their theoretical cost of capital. This helps explain why MetLife trades at a 25% discount to its book value, according to FactSet. Mr. Kandarian concluded his remarks on Thursday by thanking MetLife investors for their patience. They will have to stay patient before they see great returns.",

        "original_post": "Copper prices rose Monday, boosted by a weaker dollar and a rally in crude oil. Copper for December delivery closed up 1.9% at $2.5190 a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which weighs the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, was recently down 0.3% at 91.40. Copper is priced in dollars and becomes more affordable to foreign buyers when the currency declines. Copper also took support from oil, with U.S. crude trading up 4.1% higher at $48.29 a barrel. Swings in oil sometimes sway copper prices, as the two commodities are often traded by funds in the same basket, with a larger share allocated to crude. Prices for the industrial metal are up over 14% this month on expectations of rising demand from top-consumer China and a boost in infrastructure spending in the U.S. under a new presidential administration. China and the U.S. are the two top consumers of copper, which is heavily used in manufacturing and construction. Some investors, however, believe copper prices have run ahead of the metal<U+2019>s fundamentals and could drift lower in coming weeks. <U+201C>Although fundamentals<U+2026>for copper have improved, the speed of the recent rally leaves it open to the charge that price action has been too much, too fast,<U+201D> Barclays analysts said in a note to clients. Prices will come under pressure between now and the end of the year as the dollar strengthens ahead of an expected U.S. interest rate increase in December, Barclays said. Meanwhile, hopes of freer trade flows and the prospect of more imports by China also buoyed investor sentiment. In a speech to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Lima, Peru, on Saturday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said his government would support a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific and was pushing forward with the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a trade pact that includes 16 countries. China, the world<U+2019>s largest copper consumer, accounts for some 45% of global demand. Copper for three-month delivery was up 2.5% at $5,557 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange.

        "original_post": "Republicans in Pennsylvania lost a long-shot legal effort Thursday to nullify state rules prohibiting them from deploying poll watchers in areas other than where they live. U.S. District Judge Gerald Pappert rejected claims by the state Republican party that it was harmed by Pennsylvania<U+2019>s requirement that poll watchers can serve only in their home counties. Poll watching has become a highly charged issue in the 2016 election. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has repeatedly questioned the fairness of the election process, while Democrats have accused Republicans and the Trump campaign of seeking to intimidate voters. The controversy has been acute in Pennsylvania, a battleground state.<U+00A0> Months ago the Trump campaign identified Philadelphia as among the urban <U+201C>hot spots<U+201D> it planned to monitor closely. In stump speeches, Mr. Trump has urged supporters <U+201C>to go out and watch<U+201D> for fraud. In response, Pennsylvania Democrats filed a federal lawsuit this week seeking to block Republicans from harassing or intimidating voters.<U+00A0>That case is separate from the one that produced Thursday<U+2019>s ruling. In the decision, Judge Pappert chided Republicans for bringing the lawsuit so close to Election Day.<U+00A0> Allowing poll watchers to roam the state <U+201C>could result in certain counties being inundated with prospective poll watchers seeking credentials<U+201D> with less than a week to go, he said. The judge also said the state GOP<U+2019>s <U+201C>preoccupation<U+201D> with poll watching disregarded other mechanisms the state had in place to prevent voter fraud. Even in Democratic strongholds like Philadelphia County, there is no shortage of Republican voters who would be eligible to monitor polls in their communities, the judge said. A spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Republican Party didn<U+2019>t immediately respond to a request for comment. <U+201C>We were confident that a court would reject the Republican Party<U+2019>s egregious attempt to cause chaos and disruption on Election Day, and we are pleased with the ruling,<U+201D> said Jeff Sheridan, a spokesman for Pennsylvania Democratic Gov.

        "original_post": "If there ever were a perfect M&A case study, it just might be the shining star at Constellation Brands Inc. The alcoholic-beverages company, which started as a bulk wine purveyor in the 1940s , has transformed itself into a beer powerhouse thanks to a key acquisition three years ago. Constellation<U+2019>s market value has since more than tripled, with the good times expected to keep rolling in its fiscal second-quarter results, out<U+00A0>Wednesday. Analysts polled by FactSet expect earnings of $1.65 a share for the period ended in August, up 6% from a year ago. Revenue is expected to have risen 13% to $1.96 billion. Analysts anticipate double-digit earnings growth in each of the next five years. Constellation acquired the U.S. distribution rights to Corona and Modelo in 2013 , benefiting by being in the right place at the right time as Anheuser-Busch InBev NV bought the half of Mexican partner Grupo Modelo it didn<U+2019>t already own. The price of regulatory approval was the sale of Modelo<U+2019>s U.S. business and a new Mexican brewery to its joint-venture partner, Constellation unit Crown Imports. Constellation, now the third-largest U.S. beer seller, owns five of the U.S.<U+2019>s top 15 most popular imported beers. Overall, beer makes up about two-thirds of Constellation<U+2019>s operating income and more than half of its revenue. Analysts expect both percentages to keep increasing in the coming years, bucking an industry trend of slower growth in noncraft beer. Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal<U+2019>s Heard on the Street team. Subscribe to the podcast. Constellation isn<U+2019>t sitting still, either. Last week Constellation put its Canadian wine business on the block and on Tuesday news emerged that it bid for a U.S. whiskey business. The auction, which could fetch more than $1 billion, is part of Constellation<U+2019>s continued effort to focus on premium wines and beer in the U.S. Granted, there are concerns. At least one analyst already has warned about how a Donald Trump presidency could affect imports and damage relationships with Mexico , all potentially hurting Constellation. Constellation shareholders don<U+2019>t seem too perturbed about next month<U+2019>s election, with the stock up about 17% so far this year. Shares fetch 24 times projected earnings, up from 18 times in the summer of 2013. But with earnings per share expected to more than double over the next five years, that rich multiple seems justified. This premium brew isn<U+2019>t too frothy just yet.

        "original_post": "A strong economy, tightening labor market and an expected stimulus package from President-elect Donald Trump would seem to be a recipe for higher inflation and tightening by the Federal Reserve. But a close look at gross-domestic-product data released Tuesday shows why inflation may not jump and why the Fed, while likely to raise rates next month, could remain cautious. The reason lies in corporate profits, profit margins and the share of income going to labor. Revisions from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed that gross domestic product grew at a 3.2% annual rate in the third quarter, better than the preliminary estimate of 2.9%. The updated figure might be low. Gross domestic income<U+2014>a measure that in theory should be the same as GDP, and that research has shown tends to be a more accurate reflection of the economy <U+2014>grew by 5.2%. Corporate profits were also strong, benefiting not just from a growing economy, but a pickup in companies<U+2019> slice of it. Domestic profits after taxes, but not adjusted for inflation, rose 9.9% from the second quarter. As a result, profit<U+2019>s share of GDI<U+2014>an economywide measure of profit margins<U+2014>increased to 6.2% from 5.7%. That isn<U+2019>t as high as the 7.3% registered in the fourth quarter of 2011, but it is well above the average share of 5% over the half-century that preceded the last recession. A big reason that margins have been so strong in recent years is that less income has been flowing to workers. Employee compensation came to 53.6% of GDI in the third quarter. It has been rising steadily from its low of 52.2% logged in the third quarter of 2014, but is well off the average of 56% over the 50 years preceding the recession. For the Fed, labor<U+2019>s diminished share of the economy may count as an argument not to jump the gun on rate increases. How much workers are paid isn't part of the Fed<U+2019>s remit, but their situation might help limit inflation. That is because companies faced with a tight job market might have to raise wages at a faster pace<U+00A0>to attract workers. But since working households haven<U+2019>t seen income gains since the 1990s, the companies may struggle to make price increases stick. That could keep inflation below the 2% rate the Fed is aiming for. The impact of higher wages would be felt in profit margins, which could decline toward their long-term average. But if the economy, and therefore sales, are growing at a faster clip, that is a pill that companies, and their shareholders, might find easy to swallow.

Ted Strickland in a campaign that was never as close as it was expected to be early in the cycle. Mr. Portman ran one of the strongest Senate campaigns on the map, focusing on local issues and those of interest to many Ohioans in a way that allowed him to avoid the difficulties posed by his party<U+2019>s presidential nominee, Donald Trump. Mr. Strickland, 75 years old, who served as governor from 2007 to 2011 and was a member of the House before that, ran a more traditional campaign, focusing on jobs, the economy and his tenure as governor navigating a state hard hit by the recession. But he was outraised and outspent by Mr. Portman, who got out of the gates early and became a model for other candidates with his local focus, emphasizing his efforts to combat algae blooms in Lake Erie and even running advertisements in Ukrainian aimed at Ohio<U+2019>s ethnic population. His strength prompted the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to cancel some advertising in the state, a further setback for Mr. Strickland. Mr. Portman, 60, has a long resume in government. He worked in the legislative affairs office of the first Bush White House before being elected to the House in a special election in 1993, where he served until 2005; he then joined the administration of George W.

        "original_post": "GREEN BAY, Wis.<U+2014> Donald Trump on Monday outlined a package of <U+201C>ethics reforms<U+201D> that he said he would push for if elected, including legislation that would ban executive branch officials and members of Congress from lobbying the government for five years after they leave office. Mr. Trump pointed to his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, as an example of why such reforms are needed, citing contributions from foreign governments to the Clinton family foundation. He said one of his proposals is a lifelong ban on senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government. Mr. Trump also proposed campaign-finance reform that prevents <U+201C>registered foreign lobbyists<U+201D> from raising money for U.S. elections and said he would expand the definition of lobbyist so former government officials couldn<U+2019>t get around the rules by calling themselves <U+201C>consultants.<U+201D> <U+201C>This will go a long way in ending government corruption,<U+201D> Mr. Trump said in a speech accompanying the release of a sparsely detailed <U+201C>five-point plan for ethics reform.<U+201D> Lobbyists and special interests have been a top target of Mr. Trump since the start of his campaign. He has said lobbyists and special interests own <U+201C>outright<U+201D> the political class in Washington and have destroyed U.S. manufacturing jobs and hurt the middle class. Yet Mr. Trump has been an active participant in the system he excoriates, giving hundreds of thousands of dollars to Republicans and Democrats<U+2014>including to past campaigns of Hillary Clinton. He has acknowledged that he donated money only to have favors returned to him. But he has described this in positive terms, saying he knows how the system works and how to break it. Until now, Mr. Trump has offered no details about how he would change the system. Instead, he has spoken only about how he would be less beholden to special interests because he is putting his money into his campaign. Still, new campaign-finance reports filed Saturday show that five big Republican donors poured at least $24 million into groups supporting Mr. Trump. Among those donors were billionaire casino owner Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, who gave $10 million to Future45, a super PAC backing Mr. Trump, and Bernie Marcus, the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot Inc., who donated $5 million to a second pro-Trump group, Rebuilding America Now.

NextGen Climate, an advocacy group that supports Mrs. Clinton, experienced problems with its phone-dialing software Monday following an online attack, according to Suzanne Henkels, a NextGen Climate spokeswoman. The attack hit TCN Inc., a St. George, Utah, company that provides phone-dialing services accessible via the internet to NextGen Climate and other groups. A TCN spokeswoman said the problems occurred in waves, lasting about an hour, starting at 2:35 p.m. ET Monday, slowing TCN<U+2019>s services and leaving them unavailable for <U+201C>a few brief periods.<U+201D> The hiccups emerged after an anonymous poster on the 4chan message board claimed that he planned to use a version of the Mirai botnet to attack TCN in hopes of harming Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign.

Things are moving, just very slowly,<U+201D> said Samantha Phillips, the city<U+2019>s emergency management director. Traffic volume is higher than usual across the city, she said. Trains between the suburbs and the city, one of the few transit services still operating, have experienced delays up to 80 minutes because of very high demand, according to transit officials. More than 4,700 transit workers have been off the job since early Tuesday, when the Transport Workers Union Local 234 struck amid contentious contract talks. Key issues include wages, pension benefits and health insurance coverage. The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority said agency and union negotiators are making <U+201C>steady progress<U+201D> toward a contract, with more talks expected Wednesday. Agency officials declined to elaborate. Union officials couldn<U+2019>t immediately be reached for comment Wednesday. SEPTA has said it would ask a judge to order employees back to work for a day if the strike isn<U+2019>t over by Election Day next Tuesday. If voters have difficulty getting to the polls, that could hurt Democrat Hillary Clinton, who is counting on a big win in the city to help her carry Pennsylvania, said Terry Madonna, a pollster at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa. Agency spokeswoman Carla Showell-Lee said there is <U+201C>too much is at stake<U+201D> for either side to not fully engage in negotiations. The transit services affected by the strike normally provide nearly 900,000 rides a day. To ease the impact of the disruption, the city is running a shuttle service for municipal employees and jurors. In addition, universities and hospitals are operating shuttles, Ms. Phillips said. Bike-share operator Indego said it is boosting capacity in certain locations for the morning and afternoon commutes, and the city has installed additional bike racks at some municipal buildings. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney has urged people to check with their employers about altering their work schedule and to use alternatives such as carpooling, walking and biking. Ms. Phillips said there are positive signs, including no reported increase in the number of car accidents. <U+201C>People are obviously frustrated, but I think for the most part people are really handling this quite well and taking it in stride,<U+201D> she said.

But if the Trump administration implements the candidate<U+2019>s platform, NASA could undergo the kind of transformation not witnessed in a generation. Although major questions remain unanswered, Mr. Trump has an ambitious plan for the U.S. to push into the final frontier. Here<U+2019>s what Trump advisers Robert Walker and Peter Navarro suggested last month in Space News magazine: <U+201C>Human exploration of our entire solar system by the end of this century should be NASA<U+2019>s focus and goal.<U+201D> That implies Mr. Trump wants astronaut boots on the ground of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn<U+2014>and even Pluto<U+2014>during his grandchildren<U+2019>s lifetimes. Current policy calls for a trip to Mars, but Mr. Trump seeks to go a couple billion miles deeper into space. The foundation of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s efforts, his advisers explained, will be public-private partnerships. For instance, he will try to transform the International Space Station into a <U+201C>quasi-public facility supported by international contributions and resupplied utilizing commercially available services.<U+201D> Leveraging the private economy<U+2019>s expertise and flexibility would accomplish much that NASA cannot do on its own. A Trump administration will establish a national space-policy council, led by Vice President Mike Pence, to coordinate NASA, military and commercial activities. However, Messrs. Walker and Navarro left out important details. Will NASA proceed with the planned journey to Mars by the 2030s? Or will the space agency return to the moon first? To what extent will commercial efforts be integrated into NASA<U+2019>s missions of exploration? They did not mention other future initiatives: the Orion deep-space vehicle, the heavy-lift Space Launch System and the Asteroid Redirect Mission. Will President Trump cancel one or more of these and pursue commercial alternatives? How much will he increase NASA<U+2019>s budget, if at all? What about international partnerships to exercise soft power and share the burden of space exploration? Mr. Trump should meet with space experts in Congress to discuss these issues. One of President Obama<U+2019>s greatest mistakes was to ignore pleas from lawmakers and abruptly cancel President Bush<U+2019>s Constellation program, which would have put astronauts back on the moon by 2020 and on Mars at an undetermined date. The president-elect isn<U+2019>t a policy wonk, but no one doubts his ambition or love for epic projects. Mr. Trump could make the American space program into an engine of renewal that could last for decades. Maybe a Donald IV can build the Trump Tower Mars. Mr. Whittington is a writer in Houston.",

Trump <U+2019>s strong showing among white, working-class and rural voters has kept him competitive in his race against Hillary Clinton , especially in battleground states like Florida and North Carolina, which are crucial to his chances. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s gains in Florida have been enough to cancel out Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s strength with Hispanic voters. With more than 90 percent of the expected vote reporting, Mr. Trump has a narrow lead in the state. Most of the remaining votes are in South Florida, where Mrs. Clinton has an advantage. Even if it is enough for her to squeak out a win, the race is likely to be extremely close and will not be projected anytime soon, and perhaps not at all tonight. A similar story holds in North Carolina. Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s inability to secure an early knockout blow in the Southeast means the contest will turn to the North. The vote count will proceed much more slowly in states like Michigan and Wisconsin than it has in Florida or North Carolina, so there is unlikely to be a quick decision in either state. If Mr. Trump wins Florida and North Carolina, he will still have to win one of six competitive states <U+2014> Colorado, Nevada, New Hampshire, Michigan, Wisconsin or Pennsylvania <U+2014> to win the election. His strength among white working-class voters makes that a real possibility. Even if he falls short, it will take a while to reach a decision.

        "original_post": "Italian voters are poised to deliver Europe<U+2019>s least surprising political <U+201C>surprise<U+201D> of the year if, as polls predict, they vote against a constitutional reform this weekend. Pay less attention to the investors and pundits who have convinced themselves that this referendum is another mortal threat to the European Union. The issues at stake are of some procedural consequence. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is asking Italians to approve a constitutional amendment that would shrink the country<U+2019>s oversized Senate to 100 members from 315 and reduce its ability to block legislation approved in the lower house. The amendments would rebalance the relationship between the national and regional governments, shifting more power to Rome. Coupled with an electoral reform already approved, Mr. Renzi says this would make it easier for prime ministers to implement economic reforms. The hope that more authority to legislate will impose greater accountability on political leaders to deliver results is a plausible reason for Italians to vote yes. But procedural reforms won<U+2019>t make or break Italy<U+2019>s economy as some investors seem to believe. Italy lags its neighbors on economic growth because its politicians haven<U+2019>t persuaded voters to back the supply-side reforms the country needs. Italy needs a Margaret Thatcher or Ronald Reagan <U+2014>even a Gerhard Schr<U+00F6>der <U+2014>not a few new clauses in the constitution. Perhaps because the issues are small, both sides have personalized the debate. Mr. Renzi invited voters to view the constitutional referendum as a vote on his government, promising to resign if he loses. His popularity has since plummeted, and the polls suggest voters are inclined to take him up on his offer. If Mr. Renzi loses, markets will have seen it coming, unlike Brexit or Donald Trump. Despite important progress on labor-market liberalization and fiscal restraint, Mr. Renzi has had mixed success as a reformer<U+2014>and now he has let his efforts get bogged down by this contentious constitutional-reform drive. You can forgive voters for leaning toward no as a way to punish Mr. Renzi for taking his eyes off the reform prize. The Prime Minister already has backed away from his earlier promise and may well stay in office if he loses. No one is waiting in the wings, despite the rising popularity of the maverick 5-Star Movement and lingering support for Silvio Berlusconi <U+2019>s center-right Forza Italia. While Italy experiences the euroskeptic undercurrents of other European Union members, this has not become a Brexit-style campaign about the EU. Any post-Renzi leader who attempted an <U+201C>Italexit<U+201D> would face considerable opposition. If Brussels and investors want something to worry about, it<U+2019>s this: After years of stagnation, the eurozone<U+2019>s third-largest economy can claim as its most promising reformer a politician whose main project is a constitutional reform of debatable value. Maybe voters will decide that more accountability under an amended constitution would encourage the right sort of leader to emerge, but it<U+2019>s a good bet the world won<U+2019>t end if they don<U+2019>t.",

Phil Cox, chief executive at Legacy Food Storage, a Salt Lake Citybased company, said the company sold out of freeze-dried meat over the weekend and is waiting for a replenishment shipment in the coming week. Sales for its products<U+2014>which includes a $150 bucket of 18 pounds of stroganoff, pasta Alfredo and other meals with a 25-year shelf life<U+2014>rose about 300% on Monday, the eve of the election, compared with a typical weekday, Mr. Cox said. The industry<U+2019>s shopper base<U+2014>often politically conservative or independent<U+2014>is worried that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton may beat Republican nominee Donald Trump, executives said. <U+201C>Regardless of where you stand on the political spectrum, a political win for Hillary is a business win for this industry, in the short-term and for the next four years,<U+201D> said Greg Allison, vice president of marketing at Blue Chip Group Inc., which owns the Augason Farms and Live Prepared emergency food brands. Starting Wednesday Blue Chip will offer sales to capitalize on an expected spike in <U+201C>fear, uncertainty and doubt,<U+201D> said Mr. Allison. The emergency food industry in recent years has worked to broaden its appeal beyond those preparing for the apocalypse or severe disasters since repeat sales are tricky when disaster never strikes . Companies have introduced smaller packages meant to fit under a bed to appeal to urban dwellers, meals that might also be eaten as a quick dinner and shifted some marketing to focus on more common emergencies like a power outage. But an election year fosters nervousness, and nervousness is good for the emergency food business. Each presidential election season Orem, Utah-based Emergency Essentials, LLC boosts inventory and staff to handle orders, said Scotty Pectol, director of outside sales for the company. Sales of the company<U+2019>s emergency kits and dehydrated ingredients like milk and raspberries have risen week-over-week for about two months, says Mr. Pectol. On Monday, the company had the most orders ever on Walmart.com, its largest external e-commerce outlet, he said. Still, they are below the level typical after a large natural disaster or President Barack Obama <U+2019>s two election wins, Mr. Pectol said. There is still time. Some emergency food companies believe shoppers are waiting for election results to buy. Sales have gradually increased leading up to the election, but haven't yet spiked, said Aaron Jackson, chief executive of Wise Company, Inc., a Salt Lake City-based emergency food company. Shoppers believe the race has been tight, so are still waiting to buy, said Mr. Jackson. Then those <U+201C>that voted for the loser<U+2026>will grow more concerned,<U+201D> spurring buying after the election, he said. Write to Sarah Nassauer at sarah.nassauer@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "All hail Kenneth Bone! Mr. Bone was the fellow in a red sweater who rose to his feet near the end of Sunday night<U+2019>s town hall debate. People are having a fine old time riffing on his genial manner, his festive sweater and the disposable camera he used to snap pictures after the event. But here<U+2019>s the thing about Mr. Bone: He asked a smart question about energy policy , an issue largely overlooked in the debates so far, which in turn elicited from Hillary Clinton a mention of climate change, an issue that has been completely overlooked. The question Mr. Bone asked might have been expected from an operator at a coal plant in Illinois, which he is. Essentially, he wanted to know what the candidates would do to meet the nation<U+2019>s energy needs in an environmentally friendly manner without throwing a lot of people out of work. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s answer came straight from the Tea Party playbook: The Environmental Protection Agency is <U+201C>killing our energy business.<U+201D> Hillary Clinton, he added, <U+201C>wants to put all the miners out of business.<U+201D> He<U+2019>d figure out ways to make the coal under American soil last another 1,000 years. Mrs. Clinton said she would not <U+201C>walk away<U+201D> from the job losses among miners and workers at coal-fired power plants. But she said she couldn<U+2019>t walk away from climate change, either. (Addressing that problem means more clean energy, less coal and more suffering in coal country.) Mr. Bone, a plain-spoken guy, managed to get plain, if wildly different, responses on issues that were in danger of disappearing.

        "original_post": "To the Editor: Re <U+201C> What Drives Trump? A Fear of Fading Away <U+201D> (front page, Oct. 26): It is so easy to vilify Donald Trump. He is so outrageous and over the top that I long suspected that he was a sad and lonely man, and these transcripts appear to confirm it. He is a lost little boy trying to get the attention and the acceptance he craves through any means. It leads me to believe that even though he grew up privileged and wealthy, his lack of introspection may stem from his fear of basic unworthiness. It makes me look on him with compassion, almost. It is a good lesson for all of us to remember that our leaders, heroes and idols are fragile human beings just like the rest of us. We all deserve compassion and understanding. SUSAN WEXLER Ephrata, Pa. To the Editor: Hillary Clinton apologized for referring to half of Donald Trump<U+2019>s supporters as <U+201C>deplorables.<U+201D> But it is abundantly clear that Mr. Trump is contemptuous of virtually all of his supporters. He said in one of these interviews from 2014 that <U+201C>most people aren<U+2019>t worthy of respect.<U+201D> That would certainly be his view of people who are down on their luck and feeling like victims of the new economy or of emerging cultural and social values that they do not share <U+2014> in other words, the principal constituents of his base. To say the least, Mr. Trump is a bizarre vessel for the discontent of his followers. STEVEN Y. WINNICK Wellfleet, Mass. To the Editor: I am an ordinary person (a 2 at most and a <U+201C>total loser<U+201D>). I have failed many times at various endeavors <U+2014> including career and marriage. And while I might have learned from these failures, I can<U+2019>t claim, as Donald Trump does, that <U+201C>I always turned a failure into a success.<U+201D> My sister once put a magnet on her fridge that I loved: <U+201C>Make a Mistake Every Day.<U+201D> That<U+2019>s what we all do. It<U+2019>s not shameful. It<U+2019>s human. I wish it weren<U+2019>t too late for Mr. Trump to be insightful and to practice mindfulness and empathy. Maybe a Buddhist retreat would help?

        "original_post": "It took seven and a half years, but the Obama Administration is finally awakening to the nature of Vladimir Putin <U+2019>s Russia. On Friday John Kerry said the Syrian and Russian governments should face a war-crimes probe for bombing civilians in Syria, while the U.S. intelligence community announced its belief that the Russian government is behind the cyberattacks on the Democratic Party. Many readers will recall how President Obama mocked Mitt Romney in 2012 for saying in a presidential debate that Russia is America<U+2019>s main adversary. And don<U+2019>t forget Mr. Obama<U+2019>s private whispers to then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, caught unaware on a microphone, that he<U+2019>d be ready to wheel and deal with Russia again after his 2012 re-election. The wheeling has all been done by Mr. Putin, who returned as Russian President and proceeded to roll over Mr. Obama as if he were the president of Azerbaijan. The Russian<U+2019>s affronts include his conquest of Crimea and invasion of Ukraine, his military intervention in the Middle East, and now his attempts to influence the U.S. presidential election. Secretary of State Kerry<U+2019>s moral dudgeon about Syria reflects his frustration at being gulled by the Kremlin<U+2019>s fake diplomacy one more time. But it won<U+2019>t amount to much because Mr. Obama<U+2019>s abdication in Syria has left the U.S. with little leverage on the ground. If Mr. Kerry took the war-crime issue to the United Nations, Russia and probably China would veto in the Security Council. The meddling in U.S. elections is another matter. In an unusual joint statement Friday, the Department of Homeland Security and Director of National Intelligence said that <U+201C>the U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.<U+201D> The U.S. spooks added that <U+201C>the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia,<U+201D> and that given the <U+201C>scope and sensitivity<U+201D> of these efforts <U+201C>only Russia<U+2019>s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.<U+201D> Senior-most is a euphemism for Mr. Putin. One question is why the Obama Administration has gone public with this hacking news now. One reason might be to warn Russia against dumping more of the U.S. documents it almost certainly has before Election Day. But then Russia<U+2019>s hacking habits are hardly new, and Mr. Putin is still harboring the national-security thief Edward Snowden. The timing suggests the White House may also be trying to help Hillary Clinton given her campaign<U+2019>s portrayal of Donald Trump as a Putin apologist. Sure enough, her campaign issued a statement linking Mr. Trump to the news almost on cue Friday. A public declaration alone won<U+2019>t stop the Russians. Mr. Putin has little incentive to cease because he and Russia have never paid a price for their cyber thievery. Now that he<U+2019>s had an epiphany about the Kremlin, will Mr. Obama continue to let Mr. Putin get away with it?",

        "original_post": "WASHINGTON<U+2014>As part of a sweeping review of drug-related federal sentences , President Barack Obama granted another 79 commutations on Tuesday, bringing his total number of clemency grants to federal inmates to more than 1,000. With just two months left in Mr. Obama<U+2019>s term in office, administration officials vowed to keep moving forward an ambitious review of drug-related sentences, under the constitutional power granted to the president to shorten or expunge federal sentences. All of those granted leniency on Tuesday were convicted of drug-related crimes, though more than a dozen also were convicted of federal firearms offenses. Of the 79 inmates granted leniency, 18 were serving life sentences. <U+201C>At the heart of America is the idea that we<U+2019>re all imperfect. We all make mistakes. We have to take responsibility and learn from those mistakes. And we as a society have to make sure that people who do take responsibility for their mistakes are able to earn a second chance to contribute to our communities and our country,<U+201D> Mr. Obama wrote in a Facebook post announcing the latest round of commutations. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s the right thing to do.<U+201D> The White House said it was on pace to finish reviewing more than 6,000 applications for drug-related clemency. <U+201C>I think you can anticipate that we will keep going until the end. I anticipate additional grants,<U+201D> White House counsel Neil Eggleston said. Any pending applications for clemency not approved by Mr. Obama will be passed on to the incoming president. The fate of these reviews is uncertain under the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. He ran for office on a platform of law and order, including praising New York City<U+2019>s controversial <U+201C>stop and frisk<U+201D> program that was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge. Sen. Jeff Sessions, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s pick for attorney general, is also known for his tough-on-crime stances, particularly on drug issues. Mr. Obama has made reducing sentencing disparities and scaling back the impact of some of the nation<U+2019>s punitive drug policies a key priority in his second term. The sentencing disparity between powder and crack cocaine was reduced by Congress in 2010, and many of Mr. Obama<U+2019>s clemency actions have benefited drug offenders convicted under old sentencing guidelines. Sen. Orrin Hatch, a member and former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, criticized the pace of the White House clemency push. <U+201C>We need to be very careful about letting convicted criminals out of jail early, particularly ones convicted of serious drug and firearm offenses. Among the criminals who have received commutations are individuals who destroyed lives and shattered families in their communities,<U+201D> Mr. Hatch, a Utah Republican, said in a statement.

        "original_post": "The man who sprinkled an unidentified powdered substance into the orchestra pit of the Metropolitan Opera during Saturday<U+2019>s matinee performance of <U+201C>Guillaume Tell<U+201D> may have been spreading human ashes. His actions prompted the opera house to cancel the production before it was finished, according to a spokesman for the Met. The New York Police Department was investigating the incident, in which the man tossed small amounts of a powdery substance into the pit and then fled the scene, according to police Sgt. Lee Jones. Sgt. Jones said that Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts custodial crew members removed the substance, which is now being tested. Those individuals were evaluated for injuries by EMTs and later released, said Sam Neuman, a Met spokesman. At a news conference Saturday night, police said that after reviewing security cameras and other surveillance systems they had identified the man, but declined to give his name or any details about him. According to witnesses who spoke with him, he was an out-of-towner who indicated he wanted to scatter the ashes of his mentor, police said. The incident happened during the show<U+2019>s second intermission, and no musicians were in the pit at the time, police said. Law-enforcement was still seeking to speak with the man; while his action may have been a city health violation, it isn<U+2019>t clear whether there was any criminal intent, police said. Eric Phillips, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said on Twitter that the mayor had been briefed on the situation by NYPD Commissioner James O<U+2019>Neill, and there was no immediate danger and no injuries. The Met canceled the remaining half-hour of the show and advised operagoers that <U+201C>there was a technical issue.<U+201D> Mr. Neuman didn<U+2019>t provide a precise figure on the number of people evacuated but said the auditorium holds 4,000 and that the performance had been <U+201C>well-sold.<U+201D> Later, the Met said it was canceling the evening performance of a different opera while authorities continued to investigate. New York City is still on edge after a bomb blast in the Chelsea neighborhood last month injured several dozen people . Last week, one floor of Hillary Clinton <U+2019>s Brooklyn campaign office was evacuated after an envelope containing an unidentified white powder was received there. At the news conference Saturday night, Peter Gelb, the Met<U+2019>s general manager, underscored the organization<U+2019>s concern for the safety of its patrons and performers, then added: <U+201C>We appreciate opera lovers coming to the Met.

        "original_post": "Leaders of the United Auto Workers union plan to meet with Ford Motor Co. Friday, after being taken by surprise by a tweet from President-elect Donald Trump disclosing the auto maker had shelved plans to move production of Lincoln sport-utility vehicles from the U.S. to Mexico, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Trump wrote in the late-night Twitter posting on Thursday that he had received a call from Ford Chairman Bill Ford assuring him the U.S. auto maker would keep Lincoln production at a plant in Louisville, Ky. While the plant builds higher-volume Ford Escapes along with the Lincolns and wasn<U+2019>t actually slated to close, the auto maker confirmed it reversed course on its plan to move a smaller-volume Lincoln SUV production to Mexico at a later date. For the UAW, retaining production of even lower-volume<U+00A0>nameplates is a priority, partially because it provides a hedge if the market should shift away from one of the other products UAW workers assemble. Union officials have long railed against the North American Free Trade Agreement, blaming it as a reason for a decline in high-paying auto assembly jobs. UAW President Dennis Williams last week said he was open to working with the incoming administration on reworking that agreement. Ford continues to plan to separately move a substantial part of its passenger car production from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion facility in Mexico, although that move isn<U+2019>t currently expected to result in employment<U+00A0>reduction for the UAW. While that issue is likely to remain a sticking point between Ford, the UAW and the president-elect, the Lincoln announcement isn<U+2019>t going unnoticed. Union officials only learned about the Lincoln decision and the call between the chairman and president-elect through Mr. Trump<U+2019>s tweet<U+00A0>and are meeting with Ford executives<U+00A0>to learn more about what transpired between the president-elect and the company in making this decision, according to people briefed on the matter. Todd Dunn, president for the union local in Louisville, Ky., said the UAW wasn<U+2019>t aware Ford had plans to move Lincoln output to Mexico. Rather, union members were told <U+201C>months ago<U+201D> that Ford had committed to building the vehicle at the plant through the 2019 model year. After that, it would move the crossover to another, unspecified plant, to make room for building more Escapes, he said. No job reductions were expected to result from the move and the plant was never in danger of closing, Mr. Dunn added.<U+00A0><U+00A0>Ford built roughly 37,000 Lincoln MKC crossovers last year versus 383,000 Escapes, its second best-selling model, according to WardsAuto.com. <U+201C>Before last night, our plants were secure,<U+201D> he said.<U+00A0> A Ford spokeswoman confirmed the plan now is to keep the Lincoln output in Kentucky beyond 2019. Ford routinely meets with UAW officials to debrief them on planned production changes, often telling them well in advance of making such moves public. Mr. Trump was quick to take credit for Ford<U+2019>s change of heart, saying he <U+201C>worked hard<U+201D> with Bill Ford to keep Lincoln production in the U.S. Write to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Donald Trump <U+2019>s presidential election victory has increased the chances that President Barack Obama <U+2019>s landmark net-neutrality rules could be rolled back, some telecom investors and experts said Wednesday. The rules, adopted by the Federal Communications Commission in early 2015, marked a major victory for Silicon Valley companies, such as Alphabet Inc.<U+2019>s Google unit. Aimed at ensuring a level playing field online, the net neutrality rules require broadband-access providers to treat all content coming across their networks equally, without blocking or slowing competitors or speeding up the content of those who pay more. Many broadband providers, such as Comcast Corp. and AT&T Inc., have fought hard against the rules, arguing they could undermine investment, particularly by imposing a form of utility-style regulation. Those firms have argued for a less-intrusive approach that preserves the basic principle of net neutrality. Mr. Trump tweeted criticisms of the current rules soon after the president started pushing them in late 2014, saying, <U+201C>Obama<U+2019>s attack on the internet is another top-down power grab.<U+201D> On Wednesday, a day after Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory, investors and policy wonks alike were buzzing about the possibility that the incoming president could seek to scale back the rules<U+2019> reach by, for instance, abandoning the utility-style approach. Dish Network Corp. CEO Charlie Ergen said on the company<U+2019>s third-quarter earnings conference call that the rules may get <U+201C>another look.<U+201D> He added, <U+201C>You may see net neutrality be challenged or weakened going forward.<U+201D> Berin Szoka, president of TechFreedom, a conservative advocacy group, said there is now <U+201C>a new opportunity to end the divisive and distracting fight over net neutrality.<U+201D> He predicted that either a Trump FCC or the GOP-run Congress would <U+201C>reverse [the] staggering power grabs<U+201D> made in connection with the rules. A federal appeals court panel upheld the rules earlier this year, but legal challenges continue. A net neutrality rollback would be cheered by cable and telecom firms but fiercely opposed by the likes of Dish and other streaming services. It also would be likely to generate strenuous opposition from some consumer groups. Mr. Trump, an occasional critic of Silicon Valley during the campaign, likely must worry about alienating firms that are capable of stirring protests on the internet. Meanwhile, AT&T officials held out hope that their planned merger with Time Warner Inc. eventually would win approval, despite Mr. Trump<U+2019>s professed opposition during the campaign. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s focus on domestic investment and economic development <U+201C>all fit right in with AT&T<U+2019>s goals,<U+201D> John Stephens, the company<U+2019>s CFO, said at a Wells Fargo conference Wednesday. <U+201C>We<U+2019>ve been the leading investor in this country for more than five years running, and our Time Warner transaction is all about innovation and economic development, consumer choice and investment in infrastructure.<U+201D> Write to John D.

        "original_post": "Alphabet Inc. <U+2019>s Google plans to prohibit fake-news websites from using its ad-selling software, a move that could crimp revenue at those sites. Google said Monday that it is updating its policies to ban Google ads being placed <U+201C>on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher<U+2019>s content, or the primary purpose<U+201D> of the website. The policy would include sites that distribute false news, a Google spokeswoman said. False news stories, particularly those that spread widely on Facebook Inc. <U+2019>s social network, became an issue during the recent presidential election. Google experienced its own mishap on Sunday when a false story on a right-wing blog erroneously stating Donald Trump won the popular vote appeared atop some Google search results. Some media commentators have urged tech companies to try to prevent the spread of such misinformation. Google<U+2019>s move to block some of such sites<U+2019> revenue could prove a significant step in response to the controversy. Google<U+2019>s AdSense program, which helps website operators place ads on their sites, is the most popular tool for monetizing websites and helps fund some fake-news sites. Google has long prohibited AdSense from being used on sites that promote hate speech or include pornography and violent content. Its policies previously didn<U+2019>t include language about sites that spread false content. A spokeswoman said the change to the policy was imminent, and that it follows existing Google policies that ban advertisements that misrepresent what they are marketing.

        "original_post": "A number of larger, developing economies that include China and India are set for a period of faster growth, according to leading indicators released Wednesday by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The Paris-based research body said its leading indicators also point to steady growth ahead for developed economies, including the U.S., the eurozone and Japan. Overall, they suggest global economic growth may be set to pick up in the early months of 2017. The indicators are based on a wide set of data points that have a record of anticipating future changes in economic activity, and were available in September. In addition to the two Asian giants, the leading indicators also point to recoveries in Brazil and Russia, both of which have experienced sharp declines in economic output over recent years that were linked in part to falling commodity prices. To be sure, 2016 is set to mark another year of disappointing growth for the global economy, with 2017 forecast to be only a little better. In the third quarter, economic growth picked up in the U.S., but was stable in China and the eurozone. The outlook for the global economy may have been altered by the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president. During his campaign, Mr. Trump pledged to introduce new, higher tariffs on imports from China and Mexico, and reassess other trade relationships that he said placed U.S. workers at a disadvantage. <U+201C>A less open U.S. trade regime could potentially harm the U.S. economy and damage export and GDP growth in its trading partners, particularly Mexico and China,<U+201D> economists at HSBC said in a note to clients. <U+201C>Depending on the specific measures, retaliatory action from elsewhere could be expected while the risk of trade and currency wars could grow.<U+201D> The OECD<U+2019>s leading indicators are designed to provide early signals of turning points between the acceleration and slowing of economic activity. The changes in economic activity signaled by the indicators usually follow six to nine months after they are recorded. The OECD<U+2019>s composite leading indicator for its 34 members was steady at 99.7 in September. A reading below 100.0 points to growth that is slower than normal.

Regression analysis shows that day-to-day changes in Trump<U+2019>s odds of winning had a statistically insignificant effect on log differences of the S&P 500. This is true even when controlling for log differences in Canadian and British stock markets, which should isolate U.S.-specific changes in expectations about the future of corporate profitability. There are several possible reasons for the lack of a relationship. First is that investors, and businesses more widely, are discounting the odds of a Trump election. However, forecasts based on polling data show odds of a similar magnitude. In addition, past research<U+2014>at least prior to the Brexit referendum<U+2014>showed that betting markets have performed well as predictors of electoral outcomes. Another possibility is that businesses are discounting the negative effects that Trump would have on earnings and profitability. Though the stock market can affect the economy, the two do not move in tandem. Trump<U+2019>s policies could be bad for job and GDP growth but still be healthy for corporate bottom lines. In addition, businesses may expect Trump<U+2019>s actions to be significantly constrained by the legislative and judicial branches, minimizing his impact on the actual economy. Finally, Trump may represent a tail risk, which is the risk of a low-probability event with a large impact. The odds of his election may be a small-probability outcome, and the dangers he represents to the economy conditional on election may be small-probability events with large negative effects. For example, a default or even loss of confidence in the national debt would be a potential tail risk: highly unlikely but very damaging. There is some evidence that tail risks can be systematically underestimated, which could explain the lack of stock market reaction so far.",

        "original_post": "Donald Trump <U+2019>s victory isn<U+2019>t what dollar bulls wanted. Nor is it what Japan needed. The Japanese yen took a sharp turn Wednesday as odds that Republican candidate Donald Trump would be the next president of the U.S. built up. The yen strengthened more than 3% before paring some gains. That comes after weeks of hovering around a more comfortable level for Japan<U+2019>s policy makers. A stronger yen would unwind what happened after the Bank of Japan <U+2019>s moves in September to control the government-bond yield curve. Yields on Japanese government bonds fell after the election results came in. Signs of any trouble keeping the 0% target on 10-year bonds could lead to forced tightening or reducing government-bond purchases, far from what the economy is prepared for. A crucial issue facing markets and Japan in particular, is whether Mr. Trump reignites a rerun of trade tensions from the 1990s. Should trade turbulence, weakness in U.S. stocks and investors<U+2019> hankering for safe assets all pick up, Japanese investors and companies will rush to hedge their dollar exposures. Yen-hedging demand is close to its highest on record already, according to Deutsche Bank analysts. The inevitable result: an even stronger yen. This dynamic was a key factor when the Bill Clinton administration was on the brink of a trade war with Japan two decades ago. The yen strengthened 20% during a two-year spat over luxury-car tariffs. For a country that runs a trade surplus and is a large holder of U.S. financial assets, this poses a big threat. Then there is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which still had an outside chance of passing before Tuesday<U+2019>s result. Now, the 12-nation trade treaty, which could have catapulted reforms inside Japan<U+2019>s economy, seems destined for the dustbin. Unlike the yen<U+2019>s almost 7% swing on the day of Britain<U+2019>s vote to leave the European Union, the moves Wednesday weren<U+2019>t as outsize. The trouble is the yen could track a slow and painful path stronger. Treasurys dropped Tuesday as longer-end Japanese government bonds rose, narrowing the differential between the rates. The Federal Reserve may be less likely to raise rates in December. Even as uncertainty over policy looms large, the yen<U+2019>s path appears more certain.

Mr. Toomey<U+2019>s biggest challenge was Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who threatened to drag down other congressional candidates in Pennsylvania, where he consistently polled behind Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Mr. Toomey spent much of his time trying to separate himself from Mr. Trump. He was the only Republican incumbent in a close Senate race who declined to say whether he would vote for the GOP presidential nominee. To get past the challenges created by Mr. Trump, Mr. Toomey spent his energy on local issues, highlighting his work to support police officers and prison workers, as well as to help the anthracite coal industry in the state<U+2019>s economically distressed northeast. Mr. Toomey painted himself as a moderate who teamed up with Democrats to push for background checks on gun purchases, while also staying true to his roots as a fiscal conservative, lambasting government support for wind energy and insisting that students needed to shoulder some of the cost of college. In the last week of his race, Mr. Toomey ran ads in which President Barack Obama praises him for his work on gun-control legislation. That created a winning coalition that was enough to muscle aside Ms. McGinty, 53, who ran as a standard Democrat whose positions were in line with those of her party.

        "original_post": "After a stressful election season, 45-year-old Anne Sussman ventured to Midtown hoping to find some holiday cheer: autumn leaves, the Bergdorf Goodman windows, the setting up of the Rockefeller Center tree. But when she left Central Park, she had to maneuver around a scrum of reporters and tourists taking photos of a dark 68-story skyscraper on Fifth Avenue. Across the street heavily armed police surrounded Trump Tower<U+2019>s entrance. <U+201C>This is a nightmare!<U+201D> Ms. Sussman shouted to the sky. <U+201C>This is a nightmare!<U+201D> Donald Trump is planning his presidency in Trump Tower, where he has lived for many years. All the commotion around the building has some New Yorkers pledging to avoid the neighborhood for the rest of the holiday season. New York Police Department Commissioner James O<U+2019>Neill met with the Secret Service on Thursday to discuss security issues in the area, and the mayor plans a news conference on Friday to address the issue. Observing the frenzy at the corner of 56th street, which was closed to traffic, Diana Rendon, 25, said she would stick to online shopping this year. <U+201C>They probably just think it<U+2019>s normal because it<U+2019>s the holiday season,<U+201D> Ms. Rendon said of the tourists on Fifth Avenue. <U+201C>But if you<U+2019>re from here you know that is not how it<U+2019>s supposed to look.<U+201D> Trump Tower residents and those who want to shop at the stores inside the building are being allowed to bypass police checkpoints after having their bags checked. But police are shooing away others. Meanwhile, congestion and security in the surrounding neighborhood<U+2014>home to some of Manhattan<U+2019>s fanciest retailers<U+2014>are discouraging many New Yorkers from looking for holiday gifts. <U+201C>No one is going to shop there for engagement rings for Christmas Eve,<U+201D> said Lucia Picco, 23, of the Upper East Side. <U+201C>This city is already hard to navigate,<U+201D> said Paige Merrow, also 23, standing next to Ms. Picco. <U+201C>You<U+2019>re dealing with hundreds of thousands of pedestrians and then you have cars and now we<U+2019>ve got this.<U+201D> It isn<U+2019>t just the fancy retailers being hurt. Gamal E. Ibrahim, who has a hot-dog cart near Trump Tower, said the closure of 56th Street meant he was doing less than a fifth of his normal business. <U+201C>Trump may be a nice guy,<U+201D> he said, <U+201C>but business is dying now.<U+201D> A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump didn't return requests for comment. Ms. Sussman, who had stopped at Central Park to decompress before walking down Fifth Avenue, said the scene around Trump Tower would make her break an annual holiday tradition of looking at store windows decorated for the holidays in Midtown. <U+201C>He<U+2019>s the Grinch that stole Christmas,<U+201D> Ms. Sussman said. Not everyone was complaining. Chris Lennon, a nearby Salvation Army bell ringer, said people were donating more than usual. <U+201C>I have seen more money orders and $50 bills put into this bucket and it can<U+2019>t be me because I can<U+2019>t dance,<U+201D> Mr. Lennon said. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s got to be Trump.<U+201D> Write to Zolan Kanno-Youngs at Zolan.Kanno-Youngs@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Donald J. Trump <U+2019>s rise has created deep rifts at some of the country<U+2019>s most powerful political institutions. The latest casualty: Fox News. In an extraordinary public display of rancor between top-tier news personalities, the Fox anchor Sean Hannity on Wednesday accused his colleague Megyn Kelly of bias toward Hillary Clinton , writing in a late-night tweet , <U+201C>Clearly you support her.<U+201D> Mr. Hannity<U+2019>s remark came shortly after Ms. Kelly, during her broadcast that evening, pointed out that Mr. Trump had restricted his media appearances in recent weeks to friendly questioners, including Mr. Hannity, who is an overt supporter of the Republican nominee. <U+201C>With all due respect to my friend at 10 o<U+2019>clock, he will go on Hannity and pretty much only Hannity and will not venture out to the unsafe spaces these days,<U+201D> Ms. Kelly said of Mr. Trump. Fox News has long insisted that its political journalists, like Ms. Kelly, operate separately from its prominent right-leaning commentators. But that distinction has been a source of increasing strain as Mr. Trump has avoided interviews with the network<U+2019>s news anchors in favor of more sympathetic personalities like Mr. Hannity and Bill O<U+2019>Reilly. The public clash also comes at an awkward time for Fox News, which will celebrate its 20th anniversary on Friday and has been trying to move forward from the ouster of its longtime chief, Roger Ailes, after several claims of sexual harassment. Ms. Kelly did not immediately respond to Mr. Hannity<U+2019>s online comments, which he issued several minutes after the beginning of his 10 p.m. broadcast on Wednesday. Mr. Hannity did not address Ms. Kelly<U+2019>s remarks on his show. Late on Thursday, Mr. Hannity and Ms. Kelly simultaneously tweeted a photo of themselves smiling together on a Fox News set, accompanied by a hashtag: <U+201C>#friends.<U+201D> Both anchors included a version of the same caption: <U+201C>We<U+2019>re Irish. It<U+2019>s complicated.<U+201D> Television news is a bare-knuckle business, but it is considered a breach of decorum for an anchor to publicly assail a colleague. The exchange also hinted at generational tensions with Fox News. Mr. Hannity, a network stalwart, is close to Mr. Ailes; Ms. Kelly, a newer addition, became one of Fox<U+2019>s biggest stars by appealing to a younger audience, and she is widely seen as an important figure for the network<U+2019>s future. Representatives for Fox News declined to comment. The anchors<U+2019> exchange capped an already difficult week for the network, which has been criticized for a segment on <U+201C>The O<U+2019>Reilly Factor<U+201D> that featured a correspondent, Jesse Watters, conducting a series of mocking interviews with Asian-Americans in Manhattan<U+2019>s Chinatown neighborhood. Asian-American groups denounced the segment as racist, citing its copious references to Asian stereotypes. Mayor Bill de Blasio called the segment <U+201C>vile<U+201D> and made his displeasure at Fox News known on Twitter, writing, <U+201C>Keep this guy off TV.<U+201D> Mr. Watters, on Twitter, said his interviews were meant as <U+201C>tongue-in-cheek,<U+201D> adding, <U+201C>I regret if anyone found offense.<U+201D>",

        "original_post": "DALLAS<U+2014>Former President George W. Bush touted the benefits of the North American Free Trade Agreement in a speech on Tuesday, saying the trade pact had created millions of jobs and helped bolster economies in both the U.S. and Mexico. President-elect Donald Trump has said he plans on renegotiating Nafta and exiting the agreement altogether if improved terms for the U.S. aren<U+2019>t reached. In remarks delivered at Mr. Bush<U+2019>s Presidential Center on the campus of Southern Methodist University, the former president said trade was vital to keeping the U.S. economy competitive and ensuring that workers<U+2019> wages kept rising. <U+201C>Trade shows a confidence in our workers and our business people, because trade really means we<U+2019>re willing to compete,<U+201D> he said in his speech during a conference held here by the North American Strategy for Competitiveness, a trade group which supports Nafta. Mr. Trump has railed repeatedly against Nafta, successfully tapping into frustration among voters in Rust Belt states like Michigan and Pennsylvania who felt too many factory jobs had been shipped overseas because of trade deals. Mr. Bush didn<U+2019>t comment directly on Mr. Trump<U+2019>s positions or even mention him by name, but he said he recognized that people were <U+201C>sick and tired of the status quo<U+201D> and that helped drive this year<U+2019>s election. <U+201C>I understand anger. And some people might have been angry when I was president. But anger shouldn<U+2019>t drive policy,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>What needs to drive policy is what<U+2019>s best for the people who are angry, and how does that benefit people in our country and countries in the neighborhood.<U+201D> Mr. Bush noted in his speech that the U.S. economy couldn<U+2019>t remain stagnant, saying that workers in dying industries could be successfully retrained at better paying jobs. Defending Nafta, he said the agreement had transformed the economies on both sides of the Texas border, helping to create a thriving middle class where impoverished conditions once prevailed. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re at an interesting moment about do we build on the strengths or not,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>Our group here believes we ought to build on the strengths.<U+201D> Mr. Bush and his father, former President George H.W. Bush, never embraced Mr. Trump<U+2019>s candidacy , despite being fellow Republicans. Before Election Day, a spokesman for the former president said that Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura, hadn<U+2019>t voted for either Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton, but wouldn't reveal if the couple voted for a third-party candidate or wrote in someone else. Following the election, both Bushes called Mr. Trump to congratulate him. Write to Dan Frosch at dan.frosch@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "The economy has picked up some speed. Maybe it can maintain it. Gross domestic product grew at a 2.9% annual rate in the third quarter, the Commerce Department reported Friday, significantly better than the 1.4% it posted in the second quarter and its fastest pace in two years. More important than that headline figure were the details of the report that suggest the economy may be achieving better balance. Consumer spending has been the economy<U+2019>s bulwark, as companies have hesitated to invest and government spending as a share of GDP fell to its lowest level since 1950. But even with steady job growth fueling income gains, Americans cannot act as the economy<U+2019>s single engine indefinitely. Indeed, consumer spending was actually slower in the third quarter, growing at a 2.1% annual rate versus the second quarter<U+2019>s torrid 4.3%. With household finances in good shape and the unemployment rate at 5%, consumer spending will likely pick back up a bit. Still, with much of the post-recession pent-up demand for big-ticket items like cars now likely exhausted, it isn<U+2019>t about to start running hot. But at the corporate level, spending is showing some signs of life. Spending on nonresidential structures<U+2014>office buildings, warehouses, oil wells and the like<U+2014>grew at a 5.4% rate in the third quarter after falling 2.1% in the second. That suggests that the energy sector<U+2019>s drag on business spending is starting to ease. Spending on equipment fell at a 2.7% rate, but this was actually the smallest drop of the year. It may be that with the removal of election uncertainty next month, companies will step up their spending on equipment in order to boost productivity and allay rising labor costs. With both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump proposing policies that would boost federal spending (Mrs. Clinton on things like infrastructure and education, Mr. Trump on things like border protection and defense), the long decline in government<U+2019>s share of GDP may be coming to a close. In what most investors see as the likely scenario<U+2014>a victory for Mrs. Clinton with Republicans hanging onto the House<U+2014>some sort of modest budget package next year might be the best bet. That would nudge GDP upwards. None of this argues the economy is about to surge. More things would have to come together, including a more substantial pickup in the housing market and a renewed focus on growth from U.S. companies, for that to happen. But the third quarter does signal a strong chance of better growth next year. Write to Justin Lahart at justin.lahart@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "MUNICH<U+2014>The chief executive of Siemens AG warned that rising populism is a threat facing business and the global economy as the German industrial giant reported a 20% increase in fiscal fourth-quarter earnings. Joe Kaeser singled out the populist political movements on the rise in Europe, including the referendum vote in the U.K. to leave the European Union, and the problem of mass migration. <U+201C>The rapid rise of political and social populism and accelerating global migration are causes of concern,<U+201D> Mr. Kaeser said. The Siemens CEO said he didn<U+2019>t see the election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president in the same vein as some of the populist movements that have swept through Europe. <U+201C>Siemens congratulates Mr. Trump on his victory,<U+201D> Mr. Kaeser said at the start of his remarks. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re looking forward to continuing our trust-based cooperation with the new U.S. administration,<U+201D> he said. Siemens is a heavy investor in the U.S. and has expanded rapidly in the energy sector in recent years. The company said strong underlying growth at most of its industrial business divisions contributed to the jump in net profit to <U+20AC>1.15 billion ($1.25 billion) in the three months to end-September from <U+20AC>959 million in the same period a year earlier. The figure fell short of the average of analysts<U+2019> forecasts for net profit of <U+20AC>1.26 billion. Revenue rose 3%, to <U+20AC>21.95 billion, helped by strong growth at the power and gas division. Revenue growth in that business was mainly a result of the <U+201C>strong execution<U+201D> of a large order backlog, including a <U+20AC>8 billion power generation deal with Egypt, the company said. All of the company<U+2019>s industrial business divisions were profitable, with the exception of the process industries and drives unit, which produces automation technology, industrial software and other components for manufacturers. The division posted a <U+20AC>72 million loss on weaknesses in the oil and gas and other commodity markets, and related severance charges. Siemens<U+2019>s consistently lucrative health-care division benefited from strong earnings from its diagnostic-imaging business. Remaining profitable will require continued investment in new technologies, the company said, as it confirmed a long-expected plans to publicly list the unit. Siemens last year legally separated the health-care division in anticipation of a possible flotation. The company said the timing of the listing would depend on the stock market environment, while Chief Financial Officer Ralf Thomas indicated Siemens could keep a majority stake in the business. Siemens outlined its guidance for fiscal year 2017, saying it expects a profit margin for its industrial business in a range of 10.5% to 11.5%, compared with 10.8% in fiscal 2016. Siemens proposed a dividend of <U+20AC>3.6 a share for fiscal 2016, up from <U+20AC>3.5 a share in fiscal 2015. Write to Christopher Alessi at christopher.alessi@wsj.com",

Employees removed the shouting woman from the store, but she waited in the parking lot for the woman in the hijab to emerge. Eventually, employees escorted the woman in the hijab to her car. <U+2022> At Collins Hill High School in Gwinnett County, Ga., swastikas, racist slurs, the name <U+201C>Trump<U+201D> and the message <U+201C>build a wall<U+201D> were spray-painted on school buildings and sidewalks.

        "original_post": "MEXICO CITY<U+2014>The Bank of Mexico<U+2019>s five board members all agreed last month that higher interest rates were necessary to stave off incipient inflation pressures amid a number of external and local risks to the Mexican peso, minutes of the meeting showed Thursday. The board voted unanimously on Sept. 29 to raise the overnight interest rate target by a half percentage point to 4.75%, its third rate increase of the year, after the peso had again reached new lows against the U.S. dollar. The currency depreciation has had a limited but increasing impact on consumer prices in Mexico, where annual inflation ended September at 2.97%, below the central bank<U+2019>s 3% target for a 16th consecutive month. Subindexes of core goods such as those affected by currency weakness, however, were up nearly 4%. Most board members agreed that the weaker peso, and the possibility of further depreciation, pose an inflation threat. The main external risk in the near term is the U.S. presidential election, and the negative implications for the Mexican economy that a victory by Donald Trump could have on Mexico, given his positions on migrant workers and the North American Free Trade Agreement. All central bank board members noted concerns over the U.S. election and its implications for Mexico, although the minutes made no mention of the candidates. The use of the widely traded peso by investors as a hedge against other emerging market exposure, the prospects of the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates, and oil prices were also noted as causes of possible further peso losses. The currency has recovered nearly 5% from its all-time low against the U.S. dollar at the end of September, with most of the recent gains attributed to Mr. Trump losing ground in the polls. Central bankers also discussed domestic risks for the peso such as the widening current-account deficit and rising public debt that led Standard & Poor<U+2019>s and Moody<U+2019>s Investors Service to change Mexico<U+2019>s sovereign ratings outlook to negative from stable. They agreed the outlook for economic growth had deteriorated. Several were concerned about sluggish exports, and declining business and consumer confidence, while others noted the economy was expanding in the third quarter after a 0.2% contraction in the second with consumption still robust. Others said the decline in manufactured exports appeared to have halted. In local radio interviews following the September meeting, Bank of Mexico Gov. Agust<U+00ED>n Carstens said the rate increases seek to confront ahead of time the inflation pressures stemming from a weaker peso and other causes. <U+201C>If we let inflation get away, interest rates are going to be much higher, and credit conditions more precarious,<U+201D> he said.

Organizers are hoping that the combination of the Ryder Cup<U+2019>s popularity and a venue in the shadow of Wall Street will give the event a boost. The format is similar to the Ryder Cup, with a combination of alternate shot, four-ball and singles match play. And while the international team broadens the makeup of the opponent, the U.S. team will look similar to the one that won at Hazeltine last weekend. At a news conference at the World Trade Center, Stricker said members of the winning Ryder Cup team will likely occupy between six and 10 of the 12 spots on the U.S. Presidents Cup team. Davis Love III, who captained the American team at Hazeltine, will also be an assistant captain for the U.S., along with Fred Couples.

        "original_post": "On Donald Trump <U+2019>s victory Republicans in Congress are primed for an ambitious agenda, and not a moment too soon. One immediate problem is ObamaCare<U+2019>s expansion of Medicaid, which has seen enrollment at least twice as high as advertised. Most of the insurance coverage gains from the law come from opening Medicaid eligibility beyond its original goal of helping the poor and disabled to include prime-age, able-bodied, childless adults. The Supreme Court made this expansion optional in 2012, and Governors claimed not joining would leave <U+201C>free money<U+201D> on the table because the feds would pick up 100% of the costs of new beneficiaries. In a new report this week for the Foundation for Government Accountability, Jonathan Ingram and Nicholas Horton tracked down the original enrollment projections by actuaries in 24 states that expanded and have since disclosed at least a year of data on the results. Some 11.5 million people now belong to ObamaCare<U+2019>s new class of able-bodied enrollees, or 110% higher than the projections. Analysts in California expected only 910,000 people to sign up, but instead 3.84 million have, 322% off the projections. The situation is nearly as dire in New York, where enrollment is 276% higher than expected, and Illinois, which is up 90%. This liberal state triumvirate is particularly notable because they already ran generous welfare states long before ObamaCare. The data are also an embarrassment to Kentucky (134% over) and Ohio (60% over) because the legislatures in those states rejected expanding. They were unilaterally overruled by Democratic Governor Steve Beshear and Republican John Kasich. Arkansas<U+2019>s compromise Medicaid expansion was hailed as a <U+201C>private option,<U+201D> but 51% more people have signed up for this public option than voters were told at the time. The Foundation for Government Accountability numbers exclude states that expanded recently like Alaska and Louisiana, where it is too soon to draw conclusions. The study also omits Delaware, Massachusetts and Vermont, which obtained Medicaid expansion waivers prior to ObamaCare. New or enlarged entitlements always overwhelm projections, because of so-called <U+201C>woodwork effects<U+201D> where added benefits draw out people the budget gnomes weren<U+2019>t expecting. But there<U+2019>s enough experience now where these effects should have been built into the models. Governors ignored all this to make expanding seem less costly than it would be when the bill came due. The state spending share of new Medicaid enrollment will rise to 5% next year and then to 10% by 2020, up from 0% today. The enrollment overruns mean these states will have less to spend than they planned for every other priority, especially the least fortunate. The Governors who didn<U+2019>t expand and withstood a hail of political and hospital censure are looking prescient.",

        "original_post": "The stock market has embraced the election outcome. It is less clear how the average American consumer feels about it. The University of Michigan<U+2019>s consumer-sentiment index, out<U+00A0>Wednesday, will offer one of the early takes on economic confidence immediately following the election. Historically, a sharp rally in U.S. stocks would suggest confidence should be just fine. That isn<U+2019>t a given this time around, and it has implications for the holiday shopping season. Economists expect the headline consumer-sentiment figure ticked up to 91.8. That would be up from a preliminary reading of 91.6 earlier this month, which captured only the pre-election mood, and higher than October<U+2019>s two-year low of 87.2. The survey, which questions 500 households about their financial conditions and feelings about the economy, suggests a healthy, but not exuberant, outlook. The stock market itself is often a reliable indicator of consumer sentiment, though cause and effect are unclear. Since 1978, the 20 biggest, sequential gains in the sentiment survey came during months when the S&P 500 averaged a 1.5% gain. Conversely, in the 20 months when the sentiment index had its biggest drops, the S&P 500 averaged a 2.7% decline. Several recent investor surveys have turned decidedly optimistic. Bullish sentiment in the American Association of Individual Investors<U+2019> poll last week had its biggest surge since July 2010 . And more than 80% of 650 institutional investors polled by Strategas Research Partners said the election outcome made them more bullish on stocks. But the stock market isn<U+2019>t everything. Other measures of the overall consumer mood have been mixed. Polling firm Gallup found a record 77% of Americans perceive the nation as divided , with respondents split on whether President-elect Donald Trump will do more to unite or divide the country. And optimism for Mr. Trump<U+2019>s presidency is far lower than the early results after prior elections, according to a recent poll by YouGov. Low gas prices, rising wages and improving household incomes offer reasons for hope. That might explain why Gallup also found Americans<U+2019> confidence in the economy a week after the election was higher than it had been for most of the past nine years that it has tracked this data. Should that trickle into the University of Michigan<U+2019>s sentiment data, it could be a good omen for consumer spending. But retail stocks have far outperformed the broad market<U+2019>s gains recently. Investors shouldn<U+2019>t get overly sentimental. Write to Steven Russolillo at steven.russolillo@wsj.com",

According to a spokesman for the Swedish prosecution service, the questions have been translated into Spanish from Swedish and are expected to be translated into English for Mr. Assange to answer. His answers would then be translated back into Spanish before being sent to Sweden to be translated into Swedish. The spokesman added that the prosecution service didn<U+2019>t know how long it might take until the transcript was ready. Three days have been allocated for the complex questioning, the latest twist in a long saga involving Mr. Assange. The founder of the secret-spilling site was granted asylum in the embassy after citing fears he might be extradited to the U.S. to face charges over his work. That work includes the release of thousands of secret U.S. military documents as well as emails detailing the internal deliberations of Hillary Clinton <U+2019>s presidential campaign. The U.S. hasn<U+2019>t charged Mr. Assange or requested his extradition. Mr. Assange denies the Swedish rape allegation and hasn<U+2019>t been charged for it. Sweden<U+2019>s director of public prosecutions, Marianne Ny, maintained until early 2015 that Mr. Assange must come to Sweden to be questioned at a police station because interviewing him elsewhere would likely produce lower-quality evidence. But she changed her position after coming under pressure to speed up the evidence-gathering process. A senior prosecutor Ingrid Isgren, traveled to London to question Mr. Assange. Ms. Isgren and a Swedish police official can be present but not question Mr. Assange directly. It was unclear what Mr. Assange<U+2019>s next step would be in the event that he is charged or the allegation is dropped. His lawyers couldn<U+2019>t immediately be reached for comment.

        "original_post": "WASHINGTON<U+2014>The Republican National Committee asked members to avoid election-related <U+201C>ballot security<U+201D> activities, such as poll watching in their capacity as Republican Party officers, citing a decades-old court settlement restricting such activities by national GOP officials. As part of a 1982 settlement in a lawsuit brought by Democrats, the RNC agreed to curb its efforts to monitor and challenge voter eligibility at the polls, especially in districts where the racial or ethnic composition of the electorate could be a factor in the outcome. RNC general counsel John Ryder wrote to members on Wednesday to <U+201C>remind you of the restrictions placed on the RNC by the consent decree.<U+201D> The RNC membership is made up of 168 state party representatives, three from each state and territory. The reminder from the RNC could complicate Republican candidate Donald Trump <U+2019>s efforts to recruit election observers to monitor polling places for intimidation. Though an RNC official said the decree doesn<U+2019>t apply to campaigns or state parties, no committee resources can be used on those efforts. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign has been attempting to recruit <U+201C>election observers<U+201D> to go to polling places around the country, alleging without any evidence that Democrat Hillary Clinton will try to rig the election. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign didn<U+2019>t respond to a request for comment. Mr. Ryder said the settlement prevented the members acting in their capacity as national party officials from poll watching, recruiting or training poll watchers, making contact with voters at the polls, and a wide variety of other Election Day activities. RNC members often also serve as officers in state or local Republican parties, and are often active in their personal capacity in politics. Mr. Ryder warned that they are advised not to engage in those measures even when acting independently of their job with the party. <U+201C>You are encouraged not to engage in <U+2018>ballot security<U+2019> activities even in your personal, state party or campaign capacity. If you elect to do so, please be aware that the RNC in no way sanctions your activity,<U+201D> Mr. Ryder wrote. The lawsuit stemmed from complaints during the 1981 New Jersey gubernatorial election when Democrats complained Republicans had engaged in tactics designed to suppress the votes of minority voters, who tend to vote Democratic. The lawsuit also alleged the RNC enlisted off-duty law enforcement for the purpose of voter intimidation. The RNC agreed to restrictions on its poll watching activities to settle the case. The consent decree is scheduled to expire next year, but if the party is found to have violated it, it could be extended until 2025. <U+201C>I ask your full cooperation in making sure that it is not extended,<U+201D> Mr. Ryder wrote.",

Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary-general, also said the alliance will defend all allies, a response to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s earlier suggests that the U.S. would examine how much allies spend on defense before coming to their aid. <U+201C>We don<U+2019>t say: If you don<U+2019>t pay, we won<U+2019>t protect you,<U+201D> Mr. Stoltenberg said. Mr. Stoltenberg took pains to say he wasn<U+2019>t wading into the U.S. presidential election. But Tuesday<U+2019>s comments were the third time he has weighed in after comments by Mr. Trump. NATO officials said they were disturbed by comments Mr. Trump made in the third presidential debate. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re protecting people,<U+201D> Mr. Trump said in the debate. <U+201C>They have to pay up. And I<U+2019>m a big fan of NATO, but they have to pay up.<U+201D> Mr. Trump also said NATO spending has risen as a result of his criticism of the alliance, a point also disputed by Mr. Stoltenberg. He said prodding European countries has been on top of his agenda and that of the alliance. <U+201C>After years of decline in defense spending there is now an increase in defense spending among European allies,<U+201D> Mr. Stoltenberg said. <U+201C>But this is not something that was caused by the U.S. election campaign. Mr. Stoltenberg has previously taken on Mr. Trump, though never by name, for claiming credit for the new alliance intelligence division and for other criticism of the alliance<U+2019>s focus. Mr. Trump has said NATO needs to focus more on countering terrorism and that European allies spend far too little on defense. Write to Julian E. Barnes at julian.barnes@wsj.com",

Michelle Obama has been in many ways the star of Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s campaign <U+2014> it was her speech at the Democratic convention that people were still talking about days and weeks later. On Monday night, at the campaign<U+2019>s final rally before Election Day, Mrs. Obama<U+2019>s job was, again, to convince the voters who have come to love and trust her that they should also love and trust Hillary Clinton <U+2014> or, at least, that they should vote for her. As part of her pitch, she described the kind of leader the country needs: someone <U+201C>who takes this job seriously<U+201D> and is <U+201C>ready to be commander in chief on day one.<U+201D> Someone <U+201C>who sees the dignity and humanity in all of us and who will encourage us to see the better angels in one another.<U+201D> Someone <U+201C>who sees us not as rich or poor but as hard-working folks doing the best we can with what we got.<U+201D> Someone <U+201C>who sees us not as Democrats and Republicans but as neighbors and friends who all love this country, who sees us not just as black or white, immigrant or native-born, but as brothers and sisters who are all infinitely worthy, all an important part of this great American story.<U+201D> <U+201C>I am here tonight,<U+201D> she said, <U+201C>because I believe with all my heart and soul that Hillary Clinton is that leader.<U+201D> Her speech was a rebuke to Donald Trump, who has none of the qualifications she laid out. It was also stirring counsel for Mrs. Clinton. The Clinton campaign has been criticized in the past for focusing on Mr. Trump<U+2019>s deficits rather than on their candidate<U+2019>s strengths, and all the speakers on Monday were sure to enumerate Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s leadership qualities. Mrs. Clinton herself laid out a clear set of priorities for her presidency, should she win on Tuesday: good schools, affordable college, criminal justice reform, gun safety, a higher minimum wage and equal pay for equal work. But it was Mrs. Obama who best articulated a vision in telling the crowd, some waving <U+201C>Stronger Together<U+201D> signs, some balancing their children on their shoulders, what their next four years could look like. If Hillary Clinton can achieve what Michelle Obama says she can, if she can bring together the country after a campaign season filled with hate and demagoguery, if she can encourage Americans to see one another as worthy of the nation<U+2019>s highest ideals, then she will deserve every vote cast for her on Tuesday.

Another unknown is on the horizon, he added: The outcome of the Italian referendum in December. <U+201C>The first certainty is that we are facing a lot of uncertainty.<U+201D> The European Central Bank<U+2019>s bond-buying program has been a salve to such uncertainty, Mr. Villeroy de Galhau said. <U+201C>Our monetary policy has safeguarded the euro area against the threat of deflation in recent times, and is achieving tangible progress toward our inflation target,<U+201D> he said. Eurozone inflation is expected to exceed 1% in early 2017, said the French central banker, who is also a member of the ECB<U+2019>s governing council. The ECB will continue its bond-buying program until at least March, Mr. Villeroy de Galhau said. <U+201C>In the coming months, we will decide, in a pragmatic approach, about the best evolution after March of all our available tools,<U+201D> he added. To confront heightened uncertainty following Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election, as well as the U.K. referendum to exit from the European Union , Mr. Villeroy de Galhau called on eurozone policy makers to step up efforts to boost <U+201C>productive<U+201D> investment in the eurozone, which investment in research and development and industrial machinery, and which has remained below precrisis levels in the bloc. Potential boosters to productive investment, the central banker said, include simpler and more stable regulation for entrepreneurs and more equity, rather than debt, financing for businesses. Earlier Monday in Lisbon, Bank of Portugal Governor Carlos Costa voiced concerns similar to those expressed by Mr. Villeroy de Galhau, citing rising uncertainty amid protectionist tendencies. Mr. Costa said pushing back on globalization would be a mistake. Economic growth through structural reforms, rather than isolation, is the solution, he said.

Top Democrats did their best to clear the field for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and left themselves with a problem they didn<U+2019>t see coming: Their nominee was deeply out of step with the electorate<U+2019>s mood. In hindsight, the distaste for establishment candidates is this year<U+2019>s clearest theme. Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Marco Rubio all flamed out. A self-identified socialist who hadn<U+2019>t previously even been a member of the Democratic Party won almost 45 percent of primary votes. Last week, voters in most states rejected the highly experienced Clinton for a man who will soon be the least experienced president in American history. There is no question that the Democrats now have a thin field of national leaders <U+2014> but that thinness has an upside. The party can<U+2019>t repeat the mistake of 2016. Rather than anointing a leader only to find that leader out of step with the electorate, the Democrats will have to go through more of a bottom-up process. Elected Democrats and 2018 candidates will have a chance to try out themes and arguments and see which resonate. Radically different as they are, both Barack Obama and Donald Trump made stunning ascents to the White House in precisely that way. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are the most obvious Democrats who will have a chance to shape the party<U+2019>s message. Chuck Schumer and other congressional leaders will, too. But they should have a lot of company, including from people who are less famous today. Four years is a long time. Another Democrat who deserves a hearing is one of the relatively few to have run successful populist campaigns lately: Sherrod Brown, Ohio<U+2019>s senior senator. He has an Op-Ed in this morning<U+2019>s Times about the dignity of work and about <U+201C>trade and tax policies that create immense affluence at the top and take wealth from workers.<U+201D> You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook .

Trump as president. In Portland, Ore., the police arrested 29 people while contending with what they described as an <U+201C>aggressive<U+201D> crowd of about 4,000 protesters and widespread reports of vandalism, fires and broken windows. <U+201C>Due to extensive criminal and dangerous behavior, protest is now considered a riot,<U+201D> the Portland Police Department said on Twitter . Sgt. Pete Simpson, a police spokesman, said Thursday that there were accounts of protesters with bats and drivers being attacked, but there were no reports of injuries. Photos and videos posted to social media showed vandals spray-painting buildings and cars, and the police later said on Twitter that they had deployed <U+201C>less lethal munitions,<U+201D> including pepper spray and <U+201C>rubber ball distraction devices.<U+201D> Sergeant Simpson said that the overwhelming number of participants were law-abiding citizens but that <U+201C>a smaller segment are anarchist-types<U+201D> who were hiding in the crowd. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re constantly assessing what<U+2019>s happening and trying to figure out where they<U+2019>re going next,<U+201D> he said. Protests took place in other cities, including Baltimore, Denver, Milwaukee, Oakland and Philadelphia. Some demonstrations started early Wednesday after election returns showed the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, losing to Mr. Trump, a Republican. On Twitter on Thursday night, Mr. Trump expressed his dissatisfaction at the protests, which he said were <U+201C>incited by the media.<U+201D> On Friday morning, however, Mr. Trump reversed course with a follow-up post on Twitter that praised the demonstrators and echoed the themes of unity he expressed in his victory speech. <U+201C>Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country,<U+201D> he wrote. <U+201C>We will all come together and be proud!<U+201D> Remigio Mateo, 31, a social worker in Los Angeles, said he was stunned by the results and wondered how a candidate who had used such anti-immigrant language during the presidential campaign could win election to the White House. He wanted to be with people who would understand. When a friend mentioned a protest on Wednesday night at City Hall, Mr. Mateo said he knew he needed to be there. <U+201C>This election was a real wake-up call that things aren<U+2019>t anywhere near as progressive as we thought they were,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>I feel confused, disheartened, shocked and afraid of what comes next. I felt I needed to be around others who felt the same way, not only to protest, but to think of how to move forward.<U+201D> Jennifer Medina contributed reporting.",

Mr. Trump<U+2019>s comments during the election campaign about seeking a better relationship with Russia rattled Eastern European officials. Those worries were accentuated with a Kremlin report of a<U+00A0>phone call Monday between Messrs. Trump and Putin that said the two leaders agreed on a collaborative dialogue based on <U+201C>principles of equality, mutual respect and noninterference.<U+201D> Diplomats have said Kremlin requests for<U+00A0>noninterference amount to a demand of a recognition of a Russian sphere of influence in the countries of the former Soviet Union, most important Ukraine. Germany, which has had a growing role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in recent years, has long pushed to balance the alliance<U+2019>s steps to deter Russia with more dialogue. On Tuesday,<U+00A0>German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen said Mr. Trump<U+2019>s desire for dialogue was <U+201C>completely understandable,<U+201D> but she issued a pointed reminder that <U+201C>it<U+2019>s also important not to forget our principles,<U+201D> noting Russia<U+2019>s annexation of Crimea and what she called its hybrid war in Ukraine. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Mr. Trump<U+2019>s call to Mr. Putin was <U+201C>a very normal thing.<U+201D> Mr. Stoltenberg said NATO for months has been emphasizing that it wants dialogue. But he too noted that the alliance wouldn 't accept the annexation of Ukraine<U+2019>s Crimean peninsula. <U+201C>There is no contradiction between strong defense and political dialogue,<U+201D> Mr. Stoltenberg said. <U+201C>We think it is important to respect territorial integrity and sovereignty of all nations, including Ukraine.<U+201D> During the campaign, Mr. Trump raised the possibility that U.S. defense of European allies could be contingent on whether they spend enough on defense, comments that have rattled diplomats here since the election . President Barack Obama, at a news conference before his last foreign trip as president, said Mr. Trump had told him he was interested in <U+201C>maintaining our core strategic relationships.<U+201D> Mr. Obama said he would tell foreign leaders <U+201C>there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to America<U+2019>s commitment to maintaining a strong and robust NATO.<U+201D> Mr. Stoltenberg<U+00A0>on Tuesday<U+00A0>said he shared Mr. Trump<U+2019>s view that Europe must spend more on defense and said he expected the new president to continue the U.S. role in NATO <U+201C>I am certain he will be a president of the United States who will live up to all the commitments of the United States in the alliance,<U+201D> Mr. Stoltenberg said. <U+2014>Valentina Pop contributed to the article.

The move was part of Energy Transfer<U+2019>s plans to expand its sprawling pipeline holdings after it ended its merger agreement with rival pipeline operator Williams Cos.

        "original_post": "WASHINGTON<U+2014>House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R., Utah) said he would continue to focus on Hillary Clinton <U+2019>s email practices from her time as secretary of state, although she last week lost the presidential election to Donald Trump. <U+201C>Task number one is to get what are literally tens of thousands of documents out of the State Department,<U+201D> Mr. Chaffetz said on Monday. <U+201C>The administration has given us a stiff arm for years, and hopefully now it will get loosened up.<U+201D> The State Department is in the process of releasing several thousand emails forensically recovered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation from Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s time heading the agency. Mr. Chaffetz<U+2019>s comments contrast with the position taken by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), who said over the weekend that he was setting an agenda for the Republican party focused on repealing the Affordable Care Act, replacing jobs, and boosting investment in infrastructure. Speaking on Fox News about investigating Mrs. Clinton, he said <U+201C>I leave that portion to law enforcement. That<U+2019>s just the way I do it. Keep politics out of it.<U+201D> Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, declined to comment other than to note that Mr. McCarthy had ruled out continuing such investigations into Mrs. Clinton. Democrats have moved on, and are now focused on Mr. Trump<U+2019>s business holdings, with Rep. Elijah Cummings (D., Md.), the top Democrat on Mr. Chaffetz<U+2019>s panel, calling for a review of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s investments to ensure the president-elect doesn<U+2019>t have any actual or perceived conflicts of interest. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m happy to look at any letter that the Democrats send,<U+201D> Mr. Chaffetz said, adding he would need to see some type of connection between Mr. Trump<U+2019>s investments and the federal government. <U+201C>There needs to be a federal nexus,<U+201D> Mr. Chaffetz said. <U+201C>His past business dealings didn<U+2019>t necessarily have a federal nexus.<U+201D> Mr. Trump does business with the federal government. Most prominently, he has a lease with the U.S. for the federal building he developed into a hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. His businesses would also be directly affected by tax and immigration policies. Asked about Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign-trail promise to appoint a special prosecutor to prove Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Chaffetz said that he communicated with Reince Priebus, who was picked to be Mr. Trump<U+2019>s new chief of staff, last night and that the Trump administration still needed to fill positions before addressing such questions. <U+201C>I look forward to having a discussion with whoever they appoint in the administration,<U+201D> he said. <U+2014>Richard Rubin contributed to this article.

Stewart (Common Sense column, front page, Nov. 18): I thought this article was extremely interesting and relevant, although one essential example was missing: a new power grid for the country. With modern renewable power sources dependent on intermittent conditions (sunshine for solar, wind for turbines), an imaginative new grid would be able to store energy for limited intervals, to be available whenever and wherever needed. This is a challenge we are capable of meeting with America<U+2019>s technical ingenuity. Perhaps an immigrant like Nikola Tesla will help solve it. FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA Rutherford, Calif. The writer is the film director, screenwriter and producer. To the Editor: Let<U+2019>s hope Donald Trump doesn<U+2019>t read James B. Stewart<U+2019>s suggestion to <U+201C>build something awe-inspiring.<U+201D> Do we really have to appeal to his sense of grandiosity in order to stimulate action? The result may well be a mega-golf course and resort in the center of Yellowstone Park, complete with the TRUMP logo. Repairing and improving the country<U+2019>s roads, bridges, federal buildings, national parks, energy and computer systems may not be glamorous, but such projects will generate well-paying employment instead of minimum-wage service jobs, and would leave a real (not a real-estate) and lasting legacy. DONNA BERGEN TOM MADDEN Skokie, Ill. To the Editor: I<U+2019>d like to add an item to the list of infrastructure projects suggested in the article: a coast-to-coast project to put all power and telephone lines underground. Such a project could employ more medium and low-skilled people than the construction of the Interstate Highway System did during the Eisenhower administration. It could be financed, at least partly, through the military budget as a national security measure that secures our power distribution systems against attack. And it would save untold millions of dollars year-in and year-out by avoiding the cost of power outages every time a storm hits. The current generation would thank President Donald Trump for the jobs and the boost to the economy, and generations to come would thank him for his foresight. Quite a legacy. MARC H.

The gap as of the end of September has widened since the end of August, when Mr. Trump<U+2019>s coffers trailed Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s by $50 million. In the past month, Mrs. Clinton has expanded her polling advantage over Mr. Trump, who has faced a massive backlash from both parties over a recent videotape that emerged of him bragging in 2005 about groping women without their consent. Since the videotape<U+2019>s release, several women have alleged that he kissed, grabbed or touched them without consent, allegations he has denied .

He didn<U+2019>t disclose how much of that haul was for his campaign and how much was for the joint party funds, whose dollars are largely controlled by the Republican National Committee.

        "original_post": "Frederick M. Hess and Chester Finn Jr. , writing in <U+201C> Stop Teaching Anti-Trump Bias <U+201D> in U.S. News & World Report, Nov. 16: . . . [W]e are astonished that so many educators, schools and colleges chose to treat [Trump<U+2019>s] election as reason to alarm their students and to suggest that only a Democratic victory would have aligned with the nation<U+2019>s values. We understand that the country is divided and that some kids share their parents<U+2019> fears of potentially being deported or losing their health insurance. We<U+2019>ve surely no objection to teachers comforting fearful children. That<U+2019>s a responsibility of all adults who care for them. But we don<U+2019>t believe that educators are supposed to make kids scared or teach that there is a right outcome and a wrong one to a presidential election. And we<U+2019>re puzzled to see so many educators<U+2014>and even education journalists<U+2014>imagine that Trump<U+2019>s election can only be understood through the prism of racism and xenophobia. Wednesday should have been, and doubtless was, in some schools and classrooms that never made it onto TV, a rare opportunity to teach civics and history. To explain how the Electoral College works and why it exists; to point out how many times in America<U+2019>s past, starting in 1800, an election upset has led to change and has been accompanied by the peaceful transfer of power from one party to another. Our schools do such a miserable job of imparting U.S. history and civics to their pupils that it<U+2019>s important to exploit every <U+201C>teachable moment,<U+201D> and this was a vivid one. We fear that it<U+2019>s been largely wasted or used instead for propagandizing. Education leaders insist that their response to the election outcome is not ideological; that it<U+2019>s simply a response to Trump<U+2019>s unique grotesquery. That would be easier to believe if K-12 and higher education leaders weren<U+2019>t so open to stripping the statues and names of revered presidents like Wilson, Jefferson and Washington from school and college buildings. If prominent Republicans weren<U+2019>t routinely disinvited from universities. If decent men like Mitt Romney and George W. Bush had not been routinely depicted by educators as racists, crypto-fascists and war criminals. If so many schools hadn<U+2019>t celebrated Obama<U+2019>s two elections with rallies, songs of homage and ebullient videos.",

        "original_post": "Investors have decided that President-elect Donald Trump will be very good for stocks and very bad for bonds. They shouldn<U+2019>t be so confident in their convictions. The reality is, no one except maybe for Mr. Trump knows what policies he will pursue. And even Mr. Trump doesn<U+2019>t know how those policies will affect the economy. <U+201C>The fact that Trump is a nontraditional politician means the range of outcomes is broad,<U+201D> says Mike Cloherty, RBC Capital Markets rate strategist. <U+201C>Yet we see in prices a high probability of events playing out a certain way.<U+201D> The base case scenario for the stock market rally and the bond market selloff is that Mr. Trump will be able to quickly enact a tax cut and a fiscal stimulus. The market believes that policy will increase growth with a side effect of rising inflation . Stocks win in this scenario because profits rise, and since revenues increase with higher prices, stocks also contain at least a partial inflation hedge. With growth rising at a time of near full employment, competition for workers will increase, driving up labor costs and inflation.<U+00A0>Treasurys, which don<U+2019>t benefit from growth and are hurt by inflation, suffer. Even in more mundane times, investors are pretty lousy at predicting the future. There is a lot they can get wrong in the first months of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s administration. First, will Mr. Trump and Congress be able to pass anything quickly? Second, will what they pass have the impact they predict? Mr. Trump<U+2019>s tax cuts for example will go mostly to top earners who are more likely to save the windfall than spend it. A tax break for companies to bring home cash trapped overseas could lead to bigger dividend payments and stock buybacks, which would also benefit wealthy. Such a scenario would be less compelling for stocks and likely better for bonds. Third, the stimulus would come after years of economic growth and near full employment. Normally stimulus comes during periods of economic weakness with high unemployment<U+2014>periods when the Federal Reserve is cutting rates. Coming now, any signs of rising demand might induce the Fed to raise rates faster, offsetting the stimulus. Fourth, investors seem to be discounting the possibility that Mr. Trump will follow through with the threats to pull out of trade agreements and impose trade tariffs. Economists have long viewed such barriers to trade as a negative for economic growth. They could certainly be bad for stocks. U.S. companies rely on supply chains that stretch around the world that, if disrupted, could cause major problems. Retaliatory measures from other countries could hurt exporters, as well as the substantial operations many U.S. multinationals have overseas. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election is one of the biggest political shake-ups the U.S. has ever faced. Investors shouldn<U+2019>t be so sure about where the dust will settle.

Trump has found a new reason to question the legitimacy of the 2016 election <U+2014> ballots <U+2014> and he wasted little time here on Saturday before taking issue with the voting system in this largely vote-by-mail state. <U+201C>I have real problems with ballots being sent,<U+201D> Mr. Trump said, pantomiming a ballot collector sifting envelopes and tossing some over his shoulder while counting others. <U+201C>If you don<U+2019>t have a ballot, they give you another one and they void your one at home,<U+201D> he told the crowd at an afternoon rally, explaining how voters could go fill out their ballot at the back of the venue here. <U+201C>And then, of course, the other side would send that one in too, but, you know, we don<U+2019>t do that stuff. We don<U+2019>t do that stuff.<U+201D> Mr. Trump<U+2019>s repetitive accusations of a <U+201C>rigged<U+201D> election and a slanted electoral system are grounded in the belief that fraudulent behavior would only help his opponent. Yet it was a Trump supporter in Des Moines who was charged on Thursday with a Class D felony in Iowa , having sent in two absentee ballots, both supporting Mr. Trump. The voter, Terri Rote, told Iowa Public Radio that she had not planned to send in two ballots, but made a <U+201C>spur of the moment<U+201D> decision. <U+201C>The polls are rigged,<U+201D> she added, repeating a line often said by Mr. Trump. The Polk County attorney, John P. Sarcone, told Iowa Public Radio that it was one of the very few instances of voter fraud that he had come across in his more than three decades of service. And nationally, voter fraud is rare , despite Mr. Trump<U+2019>s insistence. Nonetheless, Mr. Trump seemed undeterred in his wariness of the security of ballots, despite the same process having been in place when Cory Gardner, a Republican, defeated the incumbent Democratic senator, Mark Udall, in 2014. Mr. Trump closed his rally by encouraging his supporters to <U+201C>follow their ballots<U+201D> to make sure they are registered and counted. <U+201C>You can follow your ballot, make sure that ballot is registered, make sure that ballot is counted,<U+201D> he said, later adding, <U+201C>So follow your ballot, and if you do I, really think were gonna win Colorado and maybe win it big.<U+201D> Lynn Bartels, the spokeswoman for the Colorado secretary of state<U+2019>s office, said the electoral process in the state was secure. The most recent polling out of Colorado , a Quinnipiac poll from two weeks ago, found Mrs. Clinton had a lead of eight points in the state.

Charles Schumer and Republican challenger Wendy Long clashed on a number of national issues in the lone debate in their Senate race Sunday night at Union College. The debate was one of the last opportunities for the candidates to sway voters in a race that Mr. Schumer, a Democrat, is heavily favored to win.

Mrs. Long responded by bringing up the vulgarity of radio host Howard Stern, rapper Jay Z, who supports Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Schumer<U+2019>s second cousin once removed, comedian Amy Schumer. <U+201C>This is the pot calling the kettle black,<U+201D> Mrs. Long said. <U+201C>Neither Amy Schumer nor Jay Z nor Howard Stern is running for president,<U+201D> Mr. Schumer replied. Mr. Schumer is seeking a fourth term on Nov. 8. If he wins, the 65-year-old would be poised to become the Senate<U+2019>s top Democrat next year . If the Democrats win control of the Senate, the Brooklyn native would become majority leader, one of the most powerful figures in Washington. Mr. Schumer was asked by moderators if he was capable of challenging Mrs. Clinton if she becomes president. He cited his opposition to the Iran nuclear deal, which President Barack Obama strongly supports. Mrs. Long then questioned why Mr. Schumer didn<U+2019>t hold more press conferences to advocate against the deal. Get the best of The Wall Street Journal<U+2019>s Greater New York section delivered to your inbox every day. Sign up for the newsletter here. Mrs. Long accused Mr. Schumer of prioritizing the interests of his donors and Wall Street bankers over the middle class. <U+201C>A very good nickname for him would be the senator from the big short,<U+201D> she said. Mr. Schumer said his support for the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul legislation proved he was for regulation. Mrs. Long ran unsuccessfully against Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand in 2012. An attorney and former law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, Mrs. Long has acknowledged her slim chances of unseating Mr. Schumer. The latest Wall Street Journal-NBC 4 New York-Marist poll, from last month, showed Mr. Schumer leading Mrs. Long 70% to 24% among likely voters.

        "original_post": "TOKYO<U+2014>Japanese consumer prices fell again in October, but deflationary pressure showed some signs of softening<U+2014>a positive development for beleaguered central bankers. The core consumer price index slipped 0.4% from a year earlier in October, adjusted for fresh food and energy prices, according to data released Friday by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. The reading marked the eighth consecutive monthly decline, but was smaller than the 0.5% drop in the previous month. Economists polled by the Nikkei had expected the index to fall 0.4%. Gasoline and kerosene prices fell at slower rates, giving the index some support, according to the ministry. Still, the continued decline in overall prices suggests the Bank of Japan remains far from its goal of generating 2% inflation in the face of weak demand and persistent doubts over prospects for rising prices. The so-called <U+201C>core-core<U+201D> index, which excludes both food and energy prices, rose 0.2% in October after being flat in the previous month. The data overall suggest the Bank of Japan remains far from its goal of generating 2% inflation in the face of weak demand and persistent doubts over prospects for rising prices. The Bank of Japan<U+2019>s own inflation gauge rose 0.3% from a year earlier in October, according to data released Friday by the central bank. The reading of the so-called BOJ core index, which measures consumer prices excluding fresh food and energy, improved from 0.2% September. Officials see the index as a reliable gauge of Japan<U+2019>s underlying price trends. In its Nov. 1 quarterly outlook, the central bank forecast that the core inflation rate will reach 2% by around fiscal 2018, which ends March 2019. Many economists continue to see the BOJ<U+2019>s price views as too optimistic, despite some recent good news, such as the reversal in the yen<U+2019>s strength following Donald Trump <U+2019>s victory in the U.S. presidential election. The core index for the Tokyo metropolitan area for November fell 0.4% from a year earlier, according to the ministry. Economists see Tokyo figures as a leading indicator of nationwide price trends. In October, the Tokyo index slid 0.4%. Write to Takashi Nakamichi at takashi.nakamichi@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Mark Zuckerberg late Friday outlined several steps Facebook Inc. is testing to fight misinformation, an acknowledgment that the social network could be doing more to avoid its proliferation. Facebook is looking to label certain stories as false, build tools to classify misinformation and work with fact-checking groups, Mr. Zuckerberg, chief executive and co-founder, said in a post . <U+201C>We take misinformation seriously,<U+201D> Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. <U+201C>We know people want accurate information.<U+201D> Mr. Zuckerberg<U+2019>s comments Friday go significantly beyond his previous statements in recognizing the seriousness of the issue, and seek to quell steady criticism. In the past week, Mr. Zuckerberg has defended Facebook against claims that fake news on the site distorted public discourse about the U.S. presidential election. Two days after the election, Mr. Zuckerberg said that the notion that Facebook helped tip the election in favor of Donald Trump was <U+201C>a pretty crazy idea.<U+201D> In a lengthy post last weekend, Mr. Zuckerberg played down the prevalence of fake news on the site<U+2014>accounting for less than 1% of global content<U+2014>and said that Facebook<U+2019>s role isn<U+2019>t to be <U+201C>arbiters of truth.<U+201D> On Friday, Mr. Zuckerberg reiterated that misinformation is a small part of Facebook content, but that it takes this problem seriously. Mr. Zuckerberg said the disclosure about the steps was unusual for Facebook because it doesn<U+2019>t share specifics about works in progress. The first and most important step is to rely on technology to better classify misinformation and <U+201C>detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves,<U+201D> Mr. Zuckerberg said. Another step is to make it easier for users to report fake stories, he said. Facebook has long relied on users to flag objectionable content, including fake news. Facebook is turning to outside groups for help in fact-checking, Mr. Zuckerberg wrote.<U+00A0>It is also exploring a product that would label stories as false if they have been flagged as such by third-parties or users, and then show warnings to users who read or share the articles. Facebook earlier this week announced it would bar fake-news sites from using the company<U+2019>s ad-selling tools . Mr. Zuckerberg said he is looking into <U+201C>disrupting the economics<U+201D> of sites that traffic in fake information. Mr. Zuckerberg reiterated that Facebook doesn<U+2019>t want to become an arbiter of truth itself. <U+201C>The problems here are complex, both technically and philosophically,<U+201D> he wrote. <U+201C>We believe in giving people a voice, which means erring on the side of letting people share what they want whenever possible.<U+201D> Write to Deepa Seetharaman at Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Now we know why Hillary Clinton has never released the transcripts of her speeches to bankers. If the excerpts published by WikiLeaks last week are any guide, the texts might have cost her the Democratic nomination to Bernie Sanders. Even these excerpts explain why a majority of Americans don<U+2019>t believe she<U+2019>s honest or trustworthy. The Clinton campaign says it doesn<U+2019>t have the time to confirm the authenticity of the excerpts, which appear in emails hacked from the account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. But they sure seem to be the real thing because Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s message sounds so synthetic. She was making the rounds of the big-money speaking circuit after her stint as Secretary of State and before her anticipated run for President. The bankers were thus eager to please her with fat fees ($4.1 million in two years, according to disclosure reports), while Mrs. Clinton was eager to please the bankers with what they wanted to hear. At a Goldman Sachs event in 2013, she said that <U+201C>there is such a bias against people who have led successful and\/or complicated lives.<U+201D> You know, like her. In another speech at a Goldman event, she said, <U+201C>you are the smartest people.<U+201D> That must have made the masters of the universe feel better. She also lamented the <U+201C>politicizing<U+201D> of the 2008 financial crisis, as if she has had nothing to do with that. And she told a Deutsche Bank audience that financial reform <U+201C>really has to come from the industry itself.<U+201D> We<U+2019>re willing to bet that Elizabeth Warren didn<U+2019>t vet those remarks in advance. Some voters may see these private remarks as a signal of what they hope will be her pragmatism, and had the transcripts appeared during the primaries they would have cost her progressive political support. But that doesn<U+2019>t mean she believes what she told the bankers. Our guess is that Mrs. Clinton was conning the bankers whom she knew she would need for campaign checks in addition to those sweet $200,000 speaking fees. These days public campaign positions are usually the truer expression of political intentions. Politicians certainly lie and flip-flop. But when a presidential candidate says in public that she wants to punish banks with more regulation but in private says she really likes them, believe the public comments. Those are the comments she will pay a political cost for repudiating. Private promises to banking crowds aren<U+2019>t worth nearly as much as the gullible at Goldman paid for them.",

The railroad operator<U+2019>s shares, up 18% in the past month, rose 3% to $35.90 in recent trading. Stocks of coal-related companies have climbed since the election of Donald Trump, whose campaign included promises to revive the U.S. coal industry . At a conference Wednesday, CSX finance chief Frank Lonegro said the company now expects its bottom line may increase for the fourth quarter, thanks to moderating volume declines as well as a property sale that will offset the effect of previously disclosed debt-refinancing charges. For the quarter to date, CSX volume has declined 3% and the company now expects fourth-quarter volume will be flat to up slightly, compared with its previous estimate for volume to remain unchanged. Meanwhile, coal volume has stabilized from the third quarter and is essentially unchanged so far during the current quarter, CSX stated. Mr. Lonegro also highlighted CSX<U+2019>s cost-savings efforts, which helped the company post better-than-expected earnings for the third quarter despite weaker volume, including a 21% decline in coal shipments.

        "original_post": "The possibility of Democrats capturing the presidency and Congress is worrying enough for pharmaceutical and other health-care investors. But that isn<U+2019>t the full extent of risk that shareholders face this election season. True, presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton has proposed numerous ideas to curb the pricing power of drug manufacturers such as allowing Medicare to negotiate prices with manufacturers. Most of her proposals would require an act of Congress to enact, which becomes more likely the better Democrats do at the voting booths. There are risks elsewhere too, though. California voters are set to weigh in on a referendum known as Proposition 61 . That proposed law would mandate that state agencies would pay no more for prescription drugs than the price paid by the Department of Veterans Affairs.<U+00A0>The federal agency by law is owed steep discounts from a given drug<U+2019>s list price and is also empowered to further negotiate on price. Polls suggest the measure has a realistic chance of passing. The primary risk for investors from the law isn<U+2019>t an immediate financial hit for companies. Implementing such a broad mandate would be challenging, for starters. And should the measure pass, companies would be incentivized to simply increase list prices further as a way to compensate for any mandated discounts. That could worsen the pricing burden on patients not covered by the law. Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal<U+2019>s Heard on the Street team. Subscribe to the podcast. Instead, the measure<U+2019>s passage would deepen uncertainty, ensuring that risks to government pricing policy remain on the landscape. Such a law in the country<U+2019>s largest state would make other voters<U+2014>and politicians<U+2014>take notice. That may once again chill investor enthusiasm for the sector, in turn impacting valuations. The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index is down 11% over the past three weeks as these fears crystallize. Other sectors which also benefit from high drug prices, such as pharmacy-benefit managers and drug distributors, also face risks from a gloomier policy outlook. On the other hand, should the political storm pass without incident, industry fundamentals are likely to return to focus.<U+00A0>That would be good news. But until then, it seems the November elections will be cause for health-care investors to sweat, even without Mrs. Clinton or Donald Trump being the reason.",

        "original_post": "Donald Trump did what many leaders of his own party said couldn<U+2019>t be done: He won a national election by drawing a larger share of votes from the nation<U+2019>s shrinking pool of white voters. Mitt Romney in 2012 won white voters by 20 percentage points<U+2014>and lost the presidential election by 5 points. That persuaded many Republicans they no longer could count on drawing higher margins among white voters, making it imperative to reach minority voters to broaden the party<U+2019>s base. But Mr. Trump showed that a Republican could win by energizing big parts of the nation<U+2019>s white majority. Though the white share of the voter pool declined, as expected, Mr. Trump won those voters by a 21-percentage-point margin, exit polls showed. That gave him a winning hand, partly because Hillary Clinton couldn<U+2019>t match President Barack Obama <U+2019>s vote totals in Philadelphia, Detroit and other metropolitan areas that Democrats typically rely on. The result: Mr. Trump won the formerly Democratic Upper Midwest<U+2014>Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin<U+2014>and he leads in Michigan, where the race remains too close to call. Mrs. Clinton inherited much of the Obama coalition, and she won a larger share of college-educated white voters, many of them living in big-city suburbs, than any Democrat in at least the past five elections. The Democratic coalition that twice propelled Mr. Obama to the White House<U+2014>minority voters, young voters and segments of affluent whites<U+2014>remains intact. And yet it didn<U+2019>t come out in Obama-sized numbers. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, was able to build a larger coalition by drawing on support from scores of smaller communities. And he won working-class whites nationwide by 41 percentage points, up from his party<U+2019>s formidable 26-point advantage four years ago. Mr. Obama had carried rural Monroe County, in Ohio<U+2019>s coal belt, by 8 points in 2012. Mr. Trump won it this year by 47. Pennsylvania<U+2019>s blue-collar Luzerne County, home to Wilkes-Barre, had backed Mr. Obama by 5 points. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump won it by 19, exit polls showed. For Mrs. Clinton, it was a political death by 1,000 cuts, as rural counties, coal counties and manufacturing hubs, many of them struggling to recoup lost jobs, moved to Mr. Trump.

        "original_post": "To the Editor: Re <U+201C> When Doctors First Do Harm <U+201D> (Op-Ed, Nov. 23): M. Gregg Bloche quotes memos from the Central Intelligence Agency<U+2019>s Office of Medical Services that made clear what was expected of its doctors at clandestine interrogation sites: to flout medical ethics by deceiving and brutalizing detainees and generally collaborating in abuse that included designing a waterboarding method more extreme than the one condoned by lawyers in the George W. Bush administration. That is, engineering and participating in torture was expected behavior for C.I.A. doctors. There was thus created what can be called a malignant normality in a subculture of torturers. For me this is reminiscent of Nazi doctors, whose more vast and systematic participation in torture and murder I studied some decades ago. The doctors in charge of the gas chambers in Auschwitz had not killed anyone before their assignment to that death camp. They, too, had been socialized to a subculture of killing in what was also a manifestation of the normalization of evil. President-elect Donald Trump has advocated waterboarding and other forms of torture, but you report ( front page , Nov. 29) that if he seeks to resume it, he would meet with resistance from within the C.I.A., and especially from its medical professionals. In a democracy we are able to carry out what Dr. Bloche rightly asks for: <U+201C>an independent inquiry into what those physicians did and how they lost their ethical moorings.<U+201D> Such an inquiry could go far toward reasserting humane medical principles as well as acknowledging and rejecting the malignant normality that can prevail when condoned from above and hidden from ordinary citizens. ROBERT JAY LIFTON New York The writer, a psychiatrist, is the author of <U+201C> The Nazi Doctors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide.<U+201D> To the Editor: No physician or other medical professional should be allowed to use his or her education, training and professional status to cooperate in the torture or improper treatment of prisoners. The states that license medical professionals should bar them from participating in torture or improper treatment of prisoners. Widely accepted principles of medical ethics <U+2014> from the World Health Organization, the United Nations, the American Medical Association and others <U+2014> ban such conduct. The law needs to enforce it. Dr. M. Gregg Bloche is right that <U+201C>C.I.A. doctors may be America<U+2019>s last defense against a return to savagery.<U+201D> I believe that there would be much less abuse of prisoners if even a few physicians said, <U+201C>Sorry, sir; I could lose my license if I do that.<U+201D> As President-elect Donald Trump talks about resuming the use of torture, this is especially important. RICHARD N. GOTTFRIED New York The writer, chairman of the New York Assembly health committee, is the sponsor of A. 4489, to prohibit physicians and other medical professionals licensed in New York from participating in torture or improper treatment of a prisoner.

        "original_post": "And so we have now heard the Republican nominee for president of the United States bragging about repeated sexual assault. Donald Trump <U+2014> a man who aspires to represent the highest ideals of the nation to his fellow citizens and the world <U+2014> is heard on a videotape obtained by The Washington Post talking about how he would force himself on women. He could even grab them between their legs, he boasted. <U+201C>And when you<U+2019>re a star they let you do it,<U+201D> he said. In a statement released after the video became public on Friday, Mr. Trump tried to minimize the conversation as <U+201C>locker room banter.<U+201D> As if the problem were just his words rather than his actions. <U+201C>I apologize,<U+201D> he added, <U+201C>if anyone was offended.<U+201D> If? Well, maybe it<U+2019>s reasonable for him to wonder. This is a man who has said many outrageous things, after all, proudly violating all conventions of civic discourse with gutter attacks on women and the disabled, immigrants and minorities. He said that Senator John McCain was not a war hero and that fat women were disgusting. Yet, those kinds of remarks have not deterred the millions of Americans who fervently support him. And the Republican establishment has remained staunchly in his corner. So it is perhaps quite understandable that Mr. Trump might wonder whether anyone might be so sensitive as to actually be offended. But has he gone too far, at last? Gov. Mike Pence, you are proud to be a Christian conservative. Is this a man you would want at your dinner table, let alone in the Oval Office? Speaker Paul Ryan, you couldn<U+2019>t possibly want Donald Trump as a role model for your children. Why do you diminish yourself by urging him on the country? Senator Kelly Ayotte, you said this week in your race for re-election from New Hampshire that Mr. Trump was a role model for children. Then you said you<U+2019>d misspoken but you still planned to vote for him, even though you weren<U+2019>t actually endorsing him. Will you continue to tie yourself in knots like this? The tape was made <U+201C>many years ago,<U+201D> Mr. Trump noted in his statement on Friday. It was made in 2005. He was then 59 years old. It would be hard for anyone to argue that the man he was then is not the man he is now. Mr. Trump also noted that Bill Clinton had <U+201C>said far worse to me on the golf course.<U+201D> Who knows if that is true, and why should anyone care? Mr. Clinton is not running for president, and, at least until now, Republican politicians have not treated his private behavior as the standard by which they should be judged. We elect our presidents in the hope that they will do their best for us, including to try <U+2014> whatever their flaws and ours <U+2014> to represent the best in us. There is no such hope for Donald Trump. A version of this editorial appears in print on October 8, 2016, on Page A20 of the New York edition with the headline: The Sleaziness of Donald Trump.

In an indirect reference to populist victories such as the Brexit vote in Britain and Donald Trump <U+2019>s surprise election as U.S. president, Mr. Sch<U+00E4>uble said: <U+201C>The response can certainly not be to return to nationalism and protectionism. We can only master the world<U+2019>s problems if we continue working together.<U+201D> But the message that globalization should be shaped, not fought, if it is to benefit the people runs the risk of being tone deaf, some G-20 delegates said Wednesday, considering an antiestablishment candidate is about to take power in the U.S. and populists are dominating political dialogue across Europe . <U+201C>When Trump comes in, it will be a shake-up,<U+201D> said Yale University economics professor Robert Shiller, who attended the G-20 opening event. A lack of U.S. leadership on international issues combined with mounting isolationism across the West may make it difficult for the G-20 to speak with one voice<U+2014>which some participants said was essential in its effective response to the 2008 financial crisis. <U+201C>We now have real evidence that the population in most industrial countries has lost trust in the elite, both in the public and private sector,<U+201D> said Ngaire Woods, professor for global economic governance at Oxford University. <U+201C>People are just saying, <U+2018>we don<U+2019>t believe you<U+2019>.<U+201D> Germany said under its presidency the G-20 will focus on the opportunities of globalization and expanding international economic cooperation on trade, financial regulation and climate change<U+2014>ideas that are under attack in many countries. Mr. Trump, for instance, campaigned on easing financial regulations and reviewing climate-change commitments. His pledge to pull out of trade agreements to strike bilateral deals suggests the U.S. could make economic diplomacy a one-on-one affair driven by a narrowly defined national interest. International financial institutions also could struggle because of populist disdain for global organizations while unorthodox economic plans could disrupt the delicate balancing act required for central banks to normalize interest rates, economists warned. Even German officials are concerned about how much they can achieve. <U+201C>We are asking ourselves whether the U.S. will be willing to back agreements that might go beyond their own interest,<U+201D> said a senior German official who declined to be named. <U+201C>The big question is whether we will continue to make such considerable progress as we have made in the past.<U+201D> Write to Andrea Thomas at andrea.thomas@wsj.com",

A major topic at tonight<U+2019>s presidential debate <U+2014> maybe the first topic <U+2014> will be <U+201C>debt and entitlements,<U+201D> according to Chris Wallace, the Fox News host who is moderating the debate. I encourage you to watch for whether Wallace bases his questions on budget reality. Much of the public discussion of the national debt isn<U+2019>t based on reality. It instead relies on facts that are badly outdated. The clich<U+00E9>d way to talk about the debt is in alarmist terms <U+2014> to warn of Social Security going broke or to make references to trillions of dollars of red ink. And this negativity does have some connection to reality. Our current tax system doesn<U+2019>t seem to be raising enough money to pay for the retirement of the baby boomers, especially their health care. Eventually, taxes will need to rise or benefits will need to be cut. But it<U+2019>s also true that the long-term deficit has fallen substantially. The national debt in 2046, for instance, is now projected to be about half as large as it was projected to be seven years ago, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The plausible solutions, as a result, look quite different from how they looked several years ago <U+2014> and less scary. The central reason is the sharp slowdown in the growth of health costs, thanks to a combination of factors: a reform movement within medicine; a set of policies put in place by the Obama administration; and several other forces that no one fully grasps. Reasonable people can disagree about how much to emphasize the decline in the projected debt versus how much to emphasize the debt itself. But it<U+2019>s simply irresponsible to talk about the debt while ignoring the enormous change. Wallace has a reputation as a serious journalist, not a Fox News partisan like Sean Hannity, and I hope Wallace lives up to that reputation. You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook .

        "original_post": "It might look like it, but emerging markets haven<U+2019>t been Trumped . U.S. President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s impending expansionary fiscal policies and the potential deficits associated with them have sent bond yields surging. Taking a cue from the about-turn in Treasurys, emerging-market bond yields have followed. U.S. interest rate-led rallies usually cast a pall over emerging markets as the U.S. dollar surges, whacking the asset class indiscriminately. Going into the so-called taper tantrum in 2013<U+2014>the last time a scare over higher U.S. rates sent investors fleeing emerging markets en masse<U+2014>developing nations sat on large current account deficits, and currencies were substantially stronger against the dollar in the years leading up to it. Foreign ownership of government bonds was building to record highs. The reversal left markets bruised as almost $40 billion left emerging-markets stocks and bonds in June 2013. This time, there is some solace in the selloff. Underlying economies are healthier. Manufacturing indexes are showing clear upturns. There are exceptions, but emerging markets generally have better external balances and easier financial conditions. Oil prices<U+2014>a key source of revenue for many developing nations<U+2014>are up 21% this year, while still well off their highs after falling 50% in 2014. Fiscal policies and new political establishments have helped too. What is different this time is the possibility of the Trump administration<U+2019>s protectionist policies. These worries are real, but global trade has already stagnated for several years, a situation to which emerging economies have grown accustomed. Demand in emerging markets is increasingly domestic and reliant on trade with other emerging markets. Any improvement in U.S. growth will be a tailwind. Emerging markets have been among the best-performing assets this year . Yet the rally has been thin, with emerging markets making up around 10% of portfolios, off the peak three years ago. Investors have also gotten faster at repricing risk in still-loose central bank policy. A wild card is China. Its currency has weakened 12% since the end of 2014, and hit its weakest level since 2008 Tuesday. Other emerging markets will guide currencies lower where they can, to stay competitive. That argues for investors to find shelter in dollar-denominated emerging-market bonds . Indonesia has economic and reform momentum behind it. Its widely held 10-year dollar bonds yield 4.13%, up from 3.3% before the election. Quasi-sovereign dollar bonds attached to oil companies such as Thailand<U+2019>s PTT and Indonesia<U+2019>s Pertamina should also hold up. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election may have kicked up a storm, but emerging markets should sail through intact. Write to Anjani Trivedi at anjani.trivedi@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Beleaguered drugmaker Mylan NV<U+2019>s third-quarter results<U+00A0>on Wednesday<U+00A0>might look pretty good. Don<U+2019>t be fooled though; a financial hit from the EpiPen drug-pricing controversy is coming. Analysts polled by FactSet estimate Mylan had adjusted earnings of $1.46 a share in the September quarter, up 3% from the same period a year ago. Revenue is expected to have increased 16% to $2.7 billion. And analysts at RBC Capital Markets reckon prescriptions of the lifesaving EpiPen allergy treatment rose through at least a portion of the third quarter . The September quarter is the most crucial time of year for EpiPen sales, thanks to children, the main customers, going to summer camp and then returning to school. Roughly 40% of Mylan<U+2019>s specialty drug segment<U+2019>s sales, dominated by EpiPen, have come in the third quarter in the past two years. But the picture gets murkier from there. Mylan cut its full-year earnings target last month. That came as Mylan said it would take a $465 million charge to settle a Justice Department investigation over whether Medicaid overpaid for EpiPen. And, while Mylan reiterated its forecast for 2018 adjusted earnings of $6 a share, it didn<U+2019>t provide an outlook for next year. EpiPen<U+2019>s list price is over $600 for a pack of two, up more than 500% since Mylan began selling it in 2007. Public and political pressure over drug pricing intensified this past summer when Hillary Clinton called<U+00A0>those<U+00A0>price increases <U+201C>outrageous.<U+201D> In response to criticism, Mylan said it plans to sell a generic EpiPen at half the price. As Mylan<U+2019>s best-selling product with fat profit margins, EpiPen has catapulted its specialty drug revenue. Analysts expect it to hit $1.35 billion this year, more than double what it was five years ago. But this segment<U+2019>s revenue is now forecast to drop 25% next year. And its contribution to overall revenue, at about 12% this year, is expected to halve by 2018. It could face more competition, too. Kaleo Pharma said it will reintroduce Auvi-Q , an EpiPen rival, in the first half of next year. Mylan<U+2019>s shares have lost half their value over the past 18 months and currently trade near a three-year low. One good reason bargain-hunters aren<U+2019>t pouncing: They are allergic to more bad news on the legal and pricing front.",

        "original_post": "Investors are unusually nervous about Tuesday<U+2019>s election, but markets have been unusually calm. It<U+2019>s a situation that, one way or the other, will rapidly resolve itself. Up until the news that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had resumed its scrutiny of Hillary Clinton, investors were pretty sure that Mrs. Clinton would win. Since then, perceptions have changed. Betting-market odds, which tend to mirror financial market perceptions, still favor Mrs. Clinton but give Donald Trump a better chance of winning. As the polls have shifted, investors have hedged the possibility of a Trump victory by bidding up the price of options used to hedge against a stock market downturn. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX, has risen to 22.1 from 15.4 before the FBI news came. That is as high as the so-called fear gauge has been since the immediate aftermath of the U.K.<U+2019>s Brexit vote. Such a jump in the VIX is extremely rare for a period when the stock market has been pretty calm. Here<U+2019>s why: Technically, the VIX measures investor expectations of upcoming volatility in the S&P 500. In reality, the VIX is usually just a measure of how volatile the stock market has been. The correlation between the VIX and the S&P 500<U+2019>s daily price swings over the past 30 trading days<U+2014>what<U+2019>s known as realized volatility<U+2014>tends to be strong. Over the past week, the spread between the VIX and a realized volatility index constructed by The Wall Street Journal has grown to its widest since a brief plunge in stocks roiled markets in August 2015. In other words, the VIX is actually behaving as it is supposed to, as an indication that investors are betting on future volatility. Either the market or the VIX is right, and the gap between them will close quickly following the election. There are two ways that can happen. The market can tumble, meaning realized volatility jumps to meet the VIX. The other is the market stays calm and the VIX falls back in line. In that scenario, the stock market would be pushing higher. What a victory for Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Trump would mean for the stock market over the long run is, of course, something that investors don<U+2019>t really know. But for now, their chips are stacked around the table, and the dice are about to roll. Write to Justin Lahart at justin.lahart@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Donald J. Trump contributed another $10 million to his presidential campaign on Friday, providing a needed financial boost to his bid at a critical juncture. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s donation was revealed in disclosures filed late Friday night with the Federal Election Commission. He had pledged to make the donation in an interview aired earlier in the evening with the Fox New host Bret Baier. The donation came after earlier disclosures, filed on Thursday, revealed that Mr. Trump had not contributed any cash to his campaign in October despite claims that he would be spending heavily and despite earlier pledges to match the small contributions of his grass-roots supporters. That earlier disclosure covered only the first three weeks of October; Mr. Trump typically wires money to his campaign toward the end of the month. The donation brings Mr. Trump closer to his promise of spending $100 million of his own money on his presidential bid, which he says would allow him to remain clear of the influence of special interests. As of Friday, he had contributed $65.5 million in cash and a half-million dollars more of in-kind rent and staff salaries. As of mid-October, Mr. Trump had only $16 million in cash on hand, a small amount for a modern presidential campaign, and additional cash in joint accounts he controls. Hillary Clinton had $62.4 million. Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook , Twitter and the First Draft newsletter .",

        "original_post": "Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is on track to become the fifth presidential nominee in U.S. history to lose the election in the electoral college while also winning the national popular vote. On Wednesday morning at 11 a.m. EST , Mrs. Clinton had amassed 59,384,720 votes, compared with President-elect Donald Trump <U+2018>s 59,211,893<U+2014>a difference of more than 125,000 votes. With several states still to be called, Mr. Trump has amassed 276 electoral votes, six more than the threshold needed to win. If that trend holds up, Mrs. Clinton will become the first candidate since Al Gore in 2000 to prevail in the popular vote while also trailing in the electoral college. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s electoral tally was driven higher by narrow victories in the battleground states of Florida and North Carolina, as well as victories in blue-leaning states including Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. But those narrow electoral wins were offset by larger popular vote margins in states like California and New York, with victories in those states reaching 60%.

        "original_post": "Republicans on Tuesday jumped on Bill Clinton <U+2019>s reference to some of the gaps in the U.S. health system as an acknowledgment of shortcomings in the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The former president and husband of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was speaking in Flint, Mich., on Monday, when he noted that while the current system works fine for lower-income people, and while 25 million more people now have health coverage, other people are seeing their premiums doubled and coverage cut in half. <U+201C>The people that are getting killed in this deal are small businesspeople and individuals who make just a little too much to get any of these subsidies,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>Why? Because they<U+2019>re not organized, they don<U+2019>t have any bargaining power with insurance companies, and they<U+2019>re getting whacked.<U+201D> He later said: <U+201C>It<U+2019>s the craziest thing in the world.<U+201D> Mr. Clinton then argued in favor of his wife<U+2019>s position that more Americans who don<U+2019>t qualify for subsidies be allowed to buy into Medicare and Medicaid to get coverage. One major criticism of the health law has been a marked rise in premiums for 2017. Individuals can buy their insurance on the individual market as well as on the ACA<U+2019>s exchanges. Those who are eligible for subsidies can only get them on the ACA<U+2019>s exchanges. The subsidies help offset the cost of the higher premiums. That leads to a situation where millions of people will pay more for coverage next year, while those who qualify for subsidies will largely have their premium increases absorbed by the subsidies. <U+201C>President Clinton spoke about the importance of the Affordable Care Act and the good it has done to expand coverage for millions of Americans,<U+201D> Angel Urena, a spokesman for Mr. Clinton, said in a statement. <U+201C>And while he was slightly short-handed, it<U+2019>s clear to everyone, including President Obama, that improvements are needed.<U+201D> On Tuesday, Mr. Clinton, while campaigning for his wife, more broadly reaffirmed his support for the Affordable Care Act. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, meanwhile, mocked Mr. Clinton for his comments. <U+201C>Can you imagine what he went through after making that statement?<U+201D> Mr. Trump said at a rally Tuesday. <U+201C>He went through hell, but honestly, there have been many nights when he has gone through hell with Hillary.<U+201D> Democrats have been increasingly saying the law has problems that should be addressed. Mrs. Clinton wrote a September article in the New England Journal of Medicine said Americans face <U+201C>rising out of pocket costs and a health care system that is too fragmented.<U+201D> President Barack Obama<U+2014>who has also suggested a government-run option be added as an insurance option in the ACA<U+2014>is expected to praise the health law<U+2019>s accomplishments in a speech Wednesday.

        "original_post": "J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. has finally turned the page on a U.S. probe into its Asia hiring practices. But in the aftermath, it remains unclear how U.S. investment banks will earn money from the massive Chinese market. The bank agreed to pay $264 million to resolve charges that it hired relatives of Chinese government officials and managers of state-owned enterprises to win banking business. Several other U.S. banks are under scrutiny for similar practices, including Citigroup , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley , according to regulatory filings. More settlements are likely to follow. For shareholders of these banks, the regulatory fines and reputational damage are regrettable. But the enduring tragedy is that for all their efforts, these banks haven<U+2019>t won a lasting presence in China<U+2019>s deal-making scene. Chinese companies are increasingly turning to local banks to underwrite their IPOs and advise them on deals, both on the mainland and in Hong Kong. This is partly because Chinese banks have grown into formidable competitors. But it likely also has to do with a political climate in China that is far from welcoming to foreign business interests. Chinese banks now bring in the solid majority of investment-banking revenue in Asia, up from a very small share 10 years ago. Strictly complying with U.S. practices on relationships with government officials won<U+2019>t make it any easier for U.S. banks to win back share. There are glimmers of hope for foreign deal makers. The Wall Street Journal has reported that the Chinese government is now considering allowing U.S. banks to run their own investment-banking businesses in mainland China, where they previously could only operate through joint ventures. But this won<U+2019>t do anything to change the preference of local firms to work with Chinese banks. In Hong Kong, where foreign banks have unfettered access, they are still getting squeezed out. In 2013, American and European banks accounted for six of the top 10 banks for underwriting Hong Kong IPOs, according to Dealogic. So far this year, only two still rank in the top 10. And of course, if economic tensions between the U.S. and China rise under the coming Trump administration, even this potential Chinese concession may be off that table. In this new world, Western banks may be consigned to acting as middlemen between Chinese and foreign interests, which are still likely to seek advice from a Western, rather than Chinese, investment bank . This means banks with experience and connections in China, like Goldman Sachs and UBS, can still profit from their expertise. That isn<U+2019>t nothing. But it is hardly what Western bankers hoped for when they rushed into China in the 1990s. J.P. Morgan<U+2019>s settlement with regulators is another reminder that for outsiders, making a buck in China is never as easy as it seems.",

        "original_post": "The community policing program in Gary, Ind. , and other cities faces an uncertain future under a Justice Department led by Sen. Jeff Sessions , who is President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s pick for attorney general. The Justice Department under the Obama administration funded the $5.75 million National Initiative for Building Community Trust & Justice program in six cities, including Gary, and had planned to expand the program nationally if it was deemed a success, people involved in the program said. During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump repeatedly called for tactics like stop and frisk, which a federal judge in 2013 found unconstitutional as it was being practiced in New York City, and <U+201C>tougher<U+201D> policing to bring down crime in violent cities. Sen. Sessions has said that President Obama blames police for violence and hasn<U+2019>t strongly supported officers. Mr. Sessions has supported tough-on-crime legislation and introduced the Thin Blue Line Act last year, which would impose harsher penalties on those who target police officers. Separately, one of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s closest advisers, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, is considered one of the champions of <U+201C>broken windows<U+201D> policing, which targets those in high crime areas for minor infractions. Police chiefs and coordinators of the new law-enforcement program say that policing decisions are made at a local level and that they have no plans to return to previous tactics. <U+201C>You can<U+2019>t be punishing an entire area for a crime spike or go arresting people there for jaywalking,<U+201D> said Jerry Wiley, a former Birmingham, Ala., patrolman and the coordinator of the policing program there. <U+201C>We have to treat people better.<U+201D> In Gary, officers are starting to see themselves as more than just cops in a hurting city. <U+201C>This is about legacy,<U+201D> said Nicholas Sanchez, an officer who heads the new training in Gary. <U+201C>We have the opportunity to change the way we are seen across America.<U+201D> Funding for the program beyond next year <U+201C>is definitely a concern,<U+201D> said Joy Holliday, the coordinator of the National Initiative in Gary. <U+201C>Hopefully, we have done enough to prove the benefit of our method.<U+201D> Write to Shibani Mahtani at shibani.mahtani@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Glenn Beck , the fiery conservative media personality and former Fox News host, says that he briefly considered voting for Hillary Clinton and called opposing Donald J. Trump the <U+201C>moral, ethical choice<U+201D> <U+2014> even if doing so leads to Mrs. Clinton winning the presidential election. His comments were made after the release on Friday of a 2005 recording of Mr. Trump boasting about sexual assault that set off a war between the presidential nominee and a broad swath of the Republican establishment, including Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker. Reacting to the recording, Mr. Beck wrote over the weekend that each person <U+201C>must decide what is a bridge too far<U+201D> and said he supported calls for Mr. Trump to withdraw from the presidential race. <U+201C>It is not acceptable to ask a moral, dignified man to cast his vote to help elect an immoral man who is absent decency or dignity,<U+201D> Mr. Beck wrote on Facebook . <U+201C>If the consequence of standing against Trump and for principles is indeed the election of Hillary Clinton, so be it. At least it is a moral, ethical choice.<U+201D> Mr. Beck was a high-profile symbol of the Tea Party movement whose show on Fox News ran until 2011, when he founded TheBlaze TV, a subscription-based online streaming network. He left the Republican Party in 2015 after accusing it of being insufficiently conservative. Mr. Beck has spoken at length over the years about his dislike for Mrs. Clinton and was an ardent Trump opponent during the Republican primary campaign, likening him to Adolf Hitler and advocating on behalf of Senator Ted Cruz. With Mr. Trump in the general election, though, Mr. Beck said in an interview on Sunday with Vice News that he had considered voting for Mrs. Clinton. <U+201C>I will tell you that it has crossed my mind to vote for Hillary,<U+201D> he said in the interview, which aired Monday night. <U+201C>It has crossed my mind. I think Donald Trump is so unstable, so dangerous, that it has crossed my mind.<U+201D> In the end, though, Mr. Beck said that he decided against voting for Mrs. Clinton. He said that he would instead back a little-known third-party candidate, Darrell Castle of the Constitution Party. <U+201C>I reject the notion of a binary choice,<U+201D> he wrote on Tuesday on his personal website. <U+201C>I will not vote for the <U+2018>lesser of two evils.<U+2019> <U+201D> On Facebook , Mr. Beck said he wanted his fans to know that <U+201C>the world does not end<U+201D> if Ms. Clinton wins the election. He said pushing back against a Clinton White House through protests, the media or <U+201C>political and procedural maneuvering<U+201D> would be a worthy effort, but warned conservatives that they would be morally tainted by a vote for Trump. <U+201C>If one helps to elect an immoral man to the highest office, then one is merely validating his immorality, lewdness, and depravity,<U+201D> he wrote.",

        "original_post": "One of the more memorable moments from last night<U+2019>s coverage of Donald Trump <U+2019>s stunning victory in the U.S. presidential election was CNN commentator Van Jones<U+2019>s impassioned speech during which he questioned how he would explain the election results to his children and minorities. Mr. Jones, a one-time member of President Barack Obama <U+2019>s administration, called the result a <U+201C>white-lash.<U+201D> He said that while some see Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory as a miracle, others see it as a <U+201C>nightmare.<U+201D> <U+201C>I have Muslim friends who are texting me tonight saying, <U+2018>should I leave the country?<U+2019><U+201D> Mr. Jones said on air during CNN<U+2019>s election coverage Tuesday night. One problem for CNN is that outside of its broadcast, many people appear to have watched that video courtesy of the web publisher NowThis on social media platforms. As of late Wednesday afternoon, the video had over 6.4 million views on CNN<U+2019>s Facebook page and over 34,000 retweets from CNN<U+2019>s Twitter account. However, the clip had already generated a whopping 23 million views on Facebook and resulted in over 16,000 retweets on Twitter for NowThis, which posted the video in the wee hours last night. Just after noon on Wednesday, NowThis had removed the clip from Facebook. It remains on Twitter , with the headline <U+201C>Everyone should hear what @VanJones68 said on CNN tonight.<U+201D> When NowThis posted the clip to Facebook last night, the video featured its logo, not CNN<U+2019>s, in the upper corner. The headline atop that video read <U+201C>Everyone in America needs to watch this.<U+201D> As a result, CNN isn't happy with NowThis, Facebook or Twitter. <U+201C>CNN views this as a violation of our intellectual property rights,<U+201D> said Andrew Morse, executive vice president of editorial for CNN, which is owned by Time Warner Inc. <U+2019>s Turner. <U+201C>We take that very seriously. The video was used without attribution or permission. We are currently exploring our options with regards to NowThis, Facebook and Twitter.<U+201D> NowThis declined to comment, while Facebook and Twitter didn<U+2019>t immediately respond to requests for comment. The skirmish is the latest example of traditional media companies seeking to protect their content in a digital world where publishers are quick to aggregate or flat out repurpose their work in search of quick traffic. In fact, according to the analytics firm Tubular Labs, 312 versions of that clip were uploaded online to various web outlets last night. It<U+2019>s worth noting that CNN<U+2019>s Mr. Morse recently spoke out about how Facebook is and isn<U+2019>t helping media companies make money on Facebook Live. <U+201C>If we can<U+2019>t figure out a way to monetize it, it<U+2019>s hard to see the long-term viability,<U+201D> he said.

        "original_post": "The Commission on Presidential Debates said Friday that the first debate on Monday was marred by an unspecified technical malfunction that affected the volume of Donald J. Trump <U+2019>s voice in the debate hall. Mr. Trump complained after the debate that the event<U+2019>s organizers had given him a <U+201C>defective mike,<U+201D> contributing to his widely panned performance against Hillary Clinton. Mrs. Clinton lampooned Mr. Trump<U+2019>s claim, telling reporters on her campaign plane, <U+201C>Anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night.<U+201D> Mr. Trump was clearly audible to the television audience. And there is no evidence of sabotage. But it turns out he was on to something. <U+201C>Regarding the first debate, there were issues regarding Donald Trump<U+2019>s audio that affected the sound level in the debate hall,<U+201D> the commission said in its statement. The commission, a nonprofit organization that sponsors the presidential debates, released no other information about the malfunction, including how it was discovered, which equipment was to blame, or why the problem was admitted to only on Friday, four days after the debate. Reached by phone, a member of the commission<U+2019>s media staff said she was not authorized to speak about the matter. Some members of the audience, held at Hofstra University in New York, recalled in interviews that the amplification of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s voice was at times significantly lower than that for Mrs. Clinton. And at times Mr. Trump appeared to be hunching down to get his face closer to his microphone. Zeke Miller, a reporter for Time Magazine who attended the debate, mentioned the difference on Monday in a report to the traveling press pool for Mr. Trump. From his vantage point, Mr. Miller wrote, Mr. Trump was sometimes <U+201C>a little quieter<U+201D> than Mrs. Clinton. In an interview, Mr. Trump said he had tested out the audio system two hours before the event and found it <U+201C>flawless.<U+201D> Only during the debate did he notice the problem, Mr. Trump said, and he tried to compensate by leaning down more closely to the microphone. He complained that the changing volume had distracted him and alleged again that someone had created the problem deliberately. <U+201C>They had somebody modulating the microphone, so when I was speaking, the mike would go up and down,<U+201D> Mr. Trump said. <U+201C>I spent 50 percent of my thought process working the mike.<U+201D> He had wanted to pause the debate to address the problem, Mr. Trump said, but felt he could not. <U+201C>How can I stop the show if I had 100 million people watching?<U+201D> he said. Asked whether he was reconsidering participating in the next debate, scheduled for Oct. 9, Mr. Trump did not answer directly. <U+201C>I want to do the next debate, but everybody is talking about the mike,<U+201D> Mr. Trump said.

        "original_post": "Bond investors just can<U+2019>t afford to relax. Last week<U+2019>s rally in bonds , caused by risk aversion in the face of a volatile U.S. presidential election campaign, reversed early Monday. Whatever the result of Tuesday<U+2019>s vote, global bonds face a considerable challenge. In truth, even last week<U+2019>s gains for bonds were relatively modest. At 1.82% in the U.S. and 0.15% in Germany, 10-year yields are close to the highest they have been since the Brexit vote in June. The only exception to the steady grind higher is Japan, where yields have been flatlining. But that is because the Bank of Japan has taken control of the yield curve, making the market largely irrelevant. The U.S. is now in the driver<U+2019>s seat. Monday<U+2019>s relapse for bonds came after the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation said that there was no change to its recommendation that Hillary Clinton not face charges related to her email practices while secretary of state. Risk appetite bounced back, with stocks rallying. The Brexit vote and moves in U.K. bonds may be instructive. The June 23 vote initially led to a big rally in global bonds, driven by both risk aversion and the idea that more global central-bank stimulus might result. But U.K. yields have since risen due to expectations of higher inflation caused by the steep fall in sterling and increased political uncertainty about how Brexit will occur. Moreover, despite the relatively small size of the gilt market, statistical analysis shows that changes in U.K. yields since the vote have tended to lead movements in other bond markets, BlueBay Asset Management notes. A similar pattern could emerge for U.S. Treasurys. A victory for Donald Trump would likely initially spur further risk aversion, because uncertainty about U.S. policy would be high. Hard-wired responses in financial markets would kick in and Treasurys would probably rally. But investors might not want to rush in. Political uncertainty and concerns over protectionism and fiscal policy could mean investors demand a higher risk premium for U.S. bonds. A victory for Mrs. Clinton, on the other hand, would be more likely to push investors back into risky assets such as stocks, also hurting bonds. The focus could move swiftly back to the Federal Reserve<U+2019>s efforts to raise rates. Whether it is populism, the shift away from disinflation, or concerns about central-bank policy, the forces arrayed against bonds still look to have the upper hand.

        "original_post": "FRANKFURT<U+2014>Europe<U+2019>s largest economy is expected to gain speed at the end of the year, as strong industry and consumer spending should lift the country out of a summer lull, Germany<U+2019>s central bank said Monday. The Deutsche Bundesbank pointed to strong industry data, such as sentiment and capacity utilization, as signals that Germany would regain momentum after lackluster quarterly growth of only 0.2% in the third quarter. This followed growth of 0.7% in the first quarter and 0.4% in the second. <U+201C>In the final quarter of 2016, growth in the German economy is likely to pick up again considerably after the temporary slowdown in the third quarter,<U+201D> said the Bundesbank in its monthly bulletin. <U+201C>Sentiment has recently brightened significantly,<U+201D> the bank said, noting that this was especially the case in manufacturing, <U+201C>in which there was also continued clear growth in capacity utilisation and a rise in order intake.<U+201D> In its preliminary growth estimate last week, the country<U+2019>s statistics office said that while private consumption contributed to growth, capital investments were a drag on growth . The Bundesbank, however, signaled that the trend here could reverse. <U+201C>High capacity utilisation is likely to stimulate the previously declining level of investment in machinery and equipment.<U+201D> In addition, the domestic economy remains in good shape. <U+201C>The ongoing favourable income and labor market prospects combined with healthy consumer sentiment also suggest a distinct increase in private consumption expenditure.<U+201D> German retailers are expecting a banner Christmas season. The country<U+2019>s retail association HDE said earlier in November that it expected nominal Christmas sales to grow by nearly 4% in annual terms. Private economists last week said they expected the German economy to grow at a faster pace in the fourth quarter than in the third but warned that protectionist policies from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump could weigh on growth over the longer term. Germany<U+2019>s statistics office will issue a more detailed analysis of third-quarter growth on Nov. 24th. Write to Todd Buell at todd.buell@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Copper prices rose Monday amid continued market optimism that a Trump presidency would boost infrastructure spending in the U.S. Copper for December delivery settled up 0.5% at $2.5210 a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, closing near its highest level in more than a year. The gains extended a multiweek rally for the industrial metal, which picked up steam after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election last week. <U+201D>Given that Trump campaigned on a platform of increased infrastructure investment within the U.S...the metals complex is understandably bullish on the prospect of a Trump presidency and the raw material requirements that his plans would require,<U+201D> Dane Davis, an analyst at Barclays , wrote in a report. Falling copper inventories in China, the world<U+2019>s biggest consumer, are also supportive of prices, Barclays said. A decline in inventories tends to suggest that metal is being moved out of warehouses for consumption. Improved demand outlook in China has boosted copper prices in the past month, as the government has proposed more spending on buildings and infrastructure. <U+201D>In terms of copper demand, our strategists believe these expectations reinforce our longstanding view for a modest improvement in market prices over the midterm,<U+201D> Citi analysts wrote about China<U+2019>s economic plans. However, some analysts remain skeptical over copper<U+2019>s ability to hold on to gains. <U+201D>In the near-term, the market<U+2019>s reaction to the election reinforces our view that base metals prices can continue to stay well supported into the year-end; however, while hard to quantify and time at this juncture, ultimately we believe the overshoot will correct itself as the fundamental demand impacts eventually underwhelm,<U+201D> J.P. Morgan said in a Monday note. The London Metal Exchange<U+2019>s three-month copper contract closed up 0.2% to $5,559.00 a metric ton. Other base metals closed mixed on Monday. Zinc rose 5.5% to $2,607.00 a ton, nickel rose 0.5% to $11,260.00 a ton and lead rose 4% to 2,195.00 a ton. Aluminum prices fell 0.6% to $1,735.00 a ton and tin fell 2.7% to $20,830.00 a ton.

        "original_post": "WASHINGTON<U+2014>The Supreme Court Monday dashed President Barack Obama <U+2019>s hopes of having his immigration plan reconsidered before he leaves office<U+2014>turning down a White House request to try again to resolve the program<U+2019>s legality after deadlocking 4-4 in June . The Supreme Court<U+2019>s tie-vote left in place a lower-court decision temporarily blocking implementation of the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program. The plan would provide work authorization to more than four million illegal immigrants whose children are U.S. citizens or lawful residents. A 26-state coalition led by Texas has sued opposing the plan. Losing parties are entitled to ask the Supreme Court to rehear a case, but such requests almost never are granted. In its July petition for rehearing, the Justice Department sought to put the case back on the docket in the hopes the high court would get a ninth justice who would be able to break the tie. Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, leaving the court short-handed<U+2014>and equally balanced between conservatives and liberals. Senate Republicans have kept a promise to deny consideration of Mr. Obama<U+2019>s nominee for the high-court vacancy, U.S. Circuit Judge Merrick Garland, leaving little prospect of a ninth justice taking the bench before the president<U+2019>s term expires. Assuming proceedings continue through the lower courts, the immigration case could return to the Supreme Court, perhaps as early as next year. Political events, however, could overtake the litigation. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has pledged to crack down on illegal immigrants and cancel Mr. Obama<U+2019>s plans for lenient treatment of those with significant ties to the U.S. Meanwhile, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has said she would go further than Mr. Obama<U+2019>s immigration plan.

        "original_post": "It was probably inevitable. With Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump battling for the presidency, Spy magazine is returning to chronicle every daily twist and turn of the campaign<U+2019>s final stretch. In its new iteration, Spy is resurfacing as a short-lived digital pop-up that will be available on Esquire magazine<U+2019>s website, Esquire.com. The new edition launched Tuesday and will last appear on Election Day. Esquire is owned by closely-held Hearst Corp. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re pleased to do a quick sprint,<U+201D> said David Carey, president of Hearst Magazines. <U+201C>You never know where something like this may lead.<U+201D> Spy, a raucous humor magazine, was co-founded in 1986 by Graydon Carter, now editor of Vanity Fair; author Kurt Andersen, and Tom Phillips. In its day Spy lampooned many of the rich and famous, describing Mr. Trump as a <U+201C>short-fingered vulgarian<U+201D> and portraying Mrs. Clinton on the February 1993 cover as clad in a leather dominatrix outfit. The publication was sold in 1994 to investor Jo Colman, chief executive and owner of Psychology Today. Mr. Colman closed Spy in 1998 but retained ownership. Mr. Colman said that he has licensed Spy to Hearst Corp. for the length of the digital edition. The new Spy has a staff of four led by special projects editor Josh Wolk. It is launching with six to eight stories. Going forward, Spy hopes to publish as many as five original pieces daily. Wieden & Kennedy is overseeing advertising. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s a fearless project and we<U+2019>re happy to be involved,<U+201D> said Colleen DeCourcy, global executive creative director, via an email. Mr. Andersen said in an interview that he<U+2019>s among those contributing to the first day<U+2019>s edition. <U+201C>I wish it well,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s amazing that it<U+2019>s back in the picture.<U+201D> Mr. Andersen<U+2019>s piece is in the form of an introductory letter to readers. Fans can expect to find new versions of such classic Spy features as <U+201C>Separated at Birth<U+201D> and <U+201C>Logrolling in Our Time.<U+201D> Some original Spy stories may also be republished. <U+201C>There may be a lot of humor surrounding this election, but there<U+2019>s ample room for Spy<U+2019>s special appreciation of the absurd,<U+201D> said Jay Fielden, who became Esquire<U+2019>s editor-in-chief last April after having served as editor of sister magazine Town & Country. <U+201C>Spy<U+2019>s past dovetails with the rise of the two people running for president. It will be a fact-based journalistic satire digitally reimagined.<U+201D> Mr. Fielden, who remains editorial director of Town & Country, added that Nov. 8 will be the edition<U+2019>s last day <U+201C>unless there are any hanging chads.<U+201D> Write to Jeffrey A.

        "original_post": "When Donald Trump, hand on the Bible on Jan. 20, swears to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, we the people will have good reason to doubt he knows what he<U+2019>s talking about. Consider what he tweeted out on Tuesday: <U+201C>Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag - if they do, there must be consequences - perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!<U+201D> Here<U+2019>s where we explain what shouldn<U+2019>t need explaining. Flag-burning is constitutionally protected speech. The Supreme Court has made this clear, in a ruling joined by Mr. Trump<U+2019>s favorite justice, Antonin Scalia. It<U+2019>s popular to want to punish flag-burners <U+2014> pandering politicians, including Hillary Clinton, have tried. But the First Amendment exists to protect unpopular, even repulsive forms of expression. As the Supreme Court said in a 1990 decision finding a federal law against flag-burning unconstitutional, <U+201C>Punishing desecration of the flag dilutes the very freedom that makes this emblem so revered, and worth revering.<U+201D> It<U+2019>s interesting that so many of the people, like Mr. Trump, who are eager to punish flag-burners are at the same time so untroubled by speech that offends minorities, women and other Americans. They rail against any concern about that kind of speech as <U+201C>political correctness.<U+201D> But in this country, flag-burning is about as politically incorrect as anything you can do. Where is their courageous defense of speech now? Isn<U+2019>t Mr. Trump the man who stood up for the freedom to say brutally unpleasant things? Who said, at the Republican convention: <U+201C>I will present the facts plainly and honestly. We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.<U+201D> The court, by the way, has also declared that citizenship cannot be stripped away , not by Congress or the president, not in this democracy. Some may choose to read Mr. Trump<U+2019>s social-media rants as relatively meaningless <U+2014> the ramblings of a sleepless id, unmoored from thought or knowledge but tuned to Fox News, which apparently was airing a piece on college flag-burners at about the time Mr. Trump sent his tweet. But we don<U+2019>t have the luxury of merely mocking someone who is now as powerful as Mr. Trump. Before you tune him out, remember what the right-wing propaganda site Breitbart was celebrating on Tuesday <U+2014> that Mr. Trump<U+2019>s social-media presence allows him to get his message to millions, bypassing <U+201C>corporate media.<U+201D> He has more than 16 million Twitter followers. With Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, he can feed lies and ignorance directly to 36 million people. He tweets, he posts, he incites. He trolls. He commands a global platform and will soon be America<U+2019>s commander in chief. But it has to be said, and said again: This is not normal. It demeans the presidency.

        "original_post": "Echoes of Donald Trump<U+2019>s worst campaign instincts <U+2014> on gun control and the news media <U+2014> are registering down ballot in North Carolina, a crucial toss-up state where Senator Richard Burr, a Republican, is in a tight re-election race. At a private gathering of Republican volunteers last weekend, the senator said he had stopped at a local gun shop and <U+201C>nothing made me feel better<U+201D> than seeing Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s photo on the cover of a gun-rights magazine. Not realizing he was being recorded, the senator drew laughter from the crowd as he added: <U+201C>I was a little bit shocked at that <U+2014> it didn<U+2019>t have a bullseye on it.<U+201D> Mr. Burr had to quickly apologize for an <U+201C>inappropriate<U+201D> comment when his offensive remarks turned up in a CNN report. His bullseye talk recalled Mr. Trump<U+2019>s remark in August that <U+201C>Second Amendment people<U+201D> could <U+201C>maybe<U+201D> find a way to deal with Hillary Clinton and her gun safety agenda if she reached the White House. Later in the week, in a move that recalled Mr. Trump<U+2019>s crusade to demonize and black-ball selected media outlets, Mr. Burr<U+2019>s campaign vindictively banned the state<U+2019>s main newspaper, The News & Observer, from receiving advance notice of the senator<U+2019>s daily campaign schedule. Republican officials accused the newspaper of bias in its coverage of the challenge Mr. Burr is facing from Deborah Ross, a Democrat. They are neck and neck in opinion polls. The paper recently reported on Mr. Burr<U+2019>s extensive fundraising activities and criticism of his poor attendance at Senate committee meetings. Mr. Burr has dealt with criticism about his support for Mr. Trump by warning that the greater danger comes from a President Clinton. In the private talk last weekend, he again echoed Mr. Trump in speculating that criminal charges could arise from the latest inquiry into Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s handling of emails. <U+201C>Could she pardon herself? And the answer is yes,<U+201D> he said, fantasizing that a Clinton victory could be followed by her indictment.",

        "original_post": "The Democrats<U+2019><U+00A0>two<U+00A0>congressional campaign arms raised record sums in September, signaling growing expectation among donors that the party will win a majority in the Senate and significantly diminish Republican strength in the House of Representatives. The Democratic Senatorial<U+00A0>Campaign Committee raised $19 million last month, the largest fundraising haul in its history, and ended the month with $28.5 million in the bank. September was the ninth consecutive month that the group raised more than its Republican counterpart. The National Republican Senatorial Committee also saw a record month, bringing in $15 million and ending September with $12.3 million on hand. But the group took out a loan for an additional $15 million to fund a late advertising<U+00A0>push, including in Missouri, North Carolina and Indiana, where it hadn<U+2019>t anticipated spending to protect its candidates. Without the loan, the NRSC would be out of cash. On the House side, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee raised $21 million in September, leaving the group with $45.5 million in the bank as it entered the final full month of the campaign. The National Republican Congressional Committee hasn<U+2019>t released its September fundraising figures yet; its fundraising has lagged behind the DCCC<U+2019>s all but one month this year. Still, the Republican group entered September with $65.5 million on hand. <U+201C>Whether House Republicans still stand with Trump, or just recently<U+2014>and desperately<U+2014>fled from him out of political calculation, we know voters will also hold House Republicans accountable on<U+00A0>Nov. 8,<U+201D> DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Luj<U+00E1>n said in a statement. The record fundraising total for Senate Democrats will fuel the party<U+2019>s effort to retake control of the chamber. They must pick up a net of five seats, or four if Hillary Clinton is elected president. Although most nonpartisan analysts think it unlikely Democrats will win the 30 House seats needed to take the majority, Republican nominee Donald Trump<U+2019>s unpopularity has some in the party predicting a net gain in the double digits. Indeed, Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) has used the specter of a Democratic majority led by Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) to goad donors. Separately, the Congressional Leadership Fund, an affiliated super PAC working to elect House Republicans, said on Friday<U+00A0>it would spend $10 million in advertising to protect Republican members of Congress who are considered safe but could be toppled in a Democratic wave. That brings the super PAC<U+2019>s spending total this year to $40 million.",

        "original_post": "WASHINGTON<U+2014>Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo White plans to step down in January,<U+00A0>opening the door to a<U+00A0>new Republican-appointed leader who could move to loosen rules on Wall Street and curb the aggressive enforcement approach Ms. White prosecuted. The change in command portends a significant shift at the SEC, which has for six years focused on tightening rules required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, a regulatory overhaul championed by Democrats. A Republican SEC chairman, appointed by President-elect Donald Trump, also could pull back on a host of rules that Ms. White conceived, including curbs on mutual funds<U+2019> use of derivatives, and stricter controls on algorithmic traders and off-exchange venues known as dark pools. Ms. White<U+2019>s departure also creates uncertainty in the short run because the SEC would have to operate with just two of the five commissioner<U+00A0>seats<U+00A0>filled after she leaves. Gridlock could ensue because one commissioner would have an effective veto on any regulatory decision or enforcement<U+00A0>action. <U+201C>Everything under Dodd-Frank is now up in the air,<U+201D> said Scott Kimpel, a partner at Hunton & Williams LLP who previously worked as a legal adviser to a Republican SEC commissioner. During Ms. White<U+2019>s tenure, which began in April 2013, the SEC overhauled the regulation of money-market mutual funds, credit-rating firms, stock exchanges, and electronic trading venues. She frequently navigated political infighting at the SEC to complete Dodd-Frank requirements, and such friction could continue under a Republican chairman. The SEC is normally governed by five commissioners, including three from the president<U+2019>s party and two from the other. President Barack Obama nominated two candidates to fill the existing vacancies more than a year ago, but the gridlocked Senate hasn<U+2019>t confirmed them. Republican Commissioner Michael Piwowar is likely to lead the agency as acting chairman after Ms. White exits, although Mr. Trump could nominate someone else as Ms. White<U+2019>s permanent successor. The SEC also pursued record numbers of enforcement cases during Ms. White<U+2019>s term, including claims against private-equity firms such as Blackstone Group LP and Apollo Global Management . Her handpicked priorities included the policing of financial-reporting fraud and punishing even the smallest violations on the theory that it would deter a culture of misconduct. Mr. Trump hasn<U+2019>t yet signaled his choices to fill SEC vacancies. But his aides have tapped Paul Atkins, a conservative former SEC commissioner, to handle issues related to the transition for the SEC and other financial regulatory agencies. The change in leadership at the SEC is just one of many ways financial regulation is expected to change course sharply<U+2014>through personnel and policy<U+2014>during Mr. Trump<U+2019>s presidency. His transition team<U+00A0>on Nov. 10 issued a statement saying it was crafting a plan to <U+201C>dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act.<U+201D> Write to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com , Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.com and Andrew Ackerman at andrew.ackerman@wsj.com",

Click here to receive this daily Opinion summary via email. Our columnist William McGurn writes on the <U+201C>cheap moralizing<U+201D> of Never Trumpers: <U+201C>Instead of weighing the prosaic facts<U+2014>i.e., the practical ramifications of having Mrs. Clinton sitting in the Oval Office versus Mr. Trump<U+2014>how much easier it is to try to end all discussion by pronouncing the GOP nominee repellent .<U+201D> Former Sen. Phil Gramm writes on one of those ramifications. To transform ObamaCare <U+201C>into a nationalized health-care system , a president is needed who has the willpower to impose the coercive details, nail down hard deadlines and unleash agencies to tighten controls and squeeze the life out of private insurers. In 1993 Hillary Clinton unapologetically proposed to do just that . If she is elected president she will have the unilateral power under ObamaCare to do it. The loss of what remains of Americans<U+2019> health-care freedom is an election away .<U+201D> Yale President Peter Salovey defends the university<U+2019>s commitment to free speech in an op-ed today : <U+201C>Those who worry that free speech is imperiled at Yale should take note of the facts. In the course of all the events and discussions of the past year, the Yale administration did not criticize, discipline or dismiss a single member of its faculty, staff or student body for expressing an opinion .<U+201D> Caterpillar Inc.

But it<U+2019>s also worth pointing out how hard it is to manage commodities-based businesses in the age of unpredictable monetary policy .<U+201D> The recent agreement by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut oil production <U+201C>is a victory for American oil-field engineering, which has triumphed over OPEC members<U+2019> social engineering<U+2014>with potentially perilous consequences for oil-exporting nations,<U+201D> writes Gary Sernovitz . Australia confirmed last week that its navy won<U+2019>t conduct freedom-of-navigation patrols in the international waters of the South China Sea, <U+201C>giving China<U+2019>s bid to dominate the strategic area a boost.

        "original_post": "LONDON<U+2014>Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said Wednesday that he is still leaning toward backing an interest-rate rise increase in December, saying the outlook for monetary policy in the short term is unchanged following Donald Trump <U+2019>s victory in this month<U+2019>s presidential election. <U+201C>A single policy rate increase, possibly in December, may be sufficient to move monetary policy to a neutral setting,<U+201D> Mr. Bullard said in a speech at an event hosted by UBS Group AG in London. Mr. Bullard is a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee. The panel meets next month in a gathering many had expected to result in a short-term rate rise, although that outcome had been clouded by Mr. Trump<U+2019>s unexpected victory . Speaking to reporters, Mr. Bullard said his own view of the economy hasn<U+2019>t changed since the election, as that data showed continued progress toward the Fed<U+2019>s goals on unemployment and inflation. <U+201C>Given the data I have to date, I haven<U+2019>t changed my outlook,<U+201D> he said. Mr. Bullard added that, unlike some other Fed officials, he believes just one quarter-point rise in the central bank<U+2019>s short-term policy rate is necessary over the next couple of years. The St. Louis Fed president has advanced the argument that the U.S. economy is in a low-rate <U+201C>regime,<U+201D> where productivity growth and the economy<U+2019>s potential to grow rapidly are subdued. Mr. Bullard said it would take time for the economic effects of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s presidency to become clear. During his campaign for the presidency, Mr. Trump talked up the need for greater spending on infrastructure. Mr. Bullard said such spending could raise U.S. productivity in future years. Longer-term, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s policies on immigration and trade were also likely to have economic effects, he added. Mr. Trump has advocated renegotiating trade deals and restricting immigration . Mr. Bullard said that after almost a decade of central bank stimulus aimed at stabilizing the economy, it is time that policy makers in the U.S. worked to raise the economy<U+2019>s long-term growth potential, such as well-designed infrastructure improvements aimed at boosting productivity. <U+201C>What we really need is to get the trend growth rate higher,<U+201D> he told reporters. Mr. Bullard<U+2019>s remarks come amid a debate in Europe and the U.S. over the extent of central bank intervention in the economy. Mr. Trump publicly criticized Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen during his campaign for the presidency, saying the Fed<U+2019>s low-rate policies aided President Barack Obama. Mr. Bullard said such debates are healthy but that having an independent central bank focused on inflation and unemployment is the best policy. <U+201C>I think we are doing very well with respect to our mandate,<U+201D> he said.

        "original_post": "Donald J. Trump posted a tweet on Sunday morning highlighting a new interview with a woman who claimed in 1999 that she was raped by Bill Clinton , signaling that he may bring up the accusation at Sunday<U+2019>s debate in an effort to counter criticism after the release of a recording showing him speaking of women in vulgar sexual terms. A video clip of the interview, which runs for about eight and a half minutes, was posted as an exclusive on Breitbart News , the website that was run by Steve Bannon before he became Mr. Trump<U+2019>s chief strategist. In it, the woman, Juanita Broaddrick, recounts her story, which was first televised in an interview with the NBC newsmagazine show <U+201C> Dateline ,<U+201D> several months after impeachment proceedings against Mr. Clinton had begun. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s promotion of the video followed the Friday release of a recording from 2005 in which he made vulgar sexual comments, causing many prominent Republicans to say they could not support his candidacy and upsetting his campaign . Ms. Broaddrick has said that the rape occurred in an Arkansas hotel room in 1978. Twenty years later, she told F.B.I. investigators working on behalf of the former independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr that Mr. Clinton had raped her, recanting an affidavit that she had signed the previous year in which she said that the incident had not taken place. At the end of the video that was published Sunday morning, Ms. Broaddrick accuses Hillary Clinton of being a knowing enabler of her husband. She says that Mrs. Clinton had at first thanked her kindly for helping with Mr. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign for governor, before changing her attitude, and <U+201C>with this very angry look on her face<U+201D> asking Ms. Broaddrick if she understood the impact of her actions. <U+201C>And that frightened me,<U+201D> Ms. Broaddrick says. Aaron Klein, the Breitbart reporter who interviewed Ms. Broaddrick, asks her if she thinks Mrs. Clinton knew what Ms. Broaddrick says she had experienced. <U+201C>At that moment, and I have to go by what I felt then and the look that she gave me, I felt like she knew,<U+201D> Ms. Broaddrick says. <U+201C>And that she was telling me to keep quiet.<U+201D> About an hour after he posted the video, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s mood seemed bolstered at the effect that the clip had had on his supporters, whose messages of encouragement he had been steadily posting. <U+201C>So many self-righteous hypocrites,<U+201D> he wrote about his Republican critics in another Twitter post. <U+201C>Watch their poll numbers <U+2014> and elections <U+2014> go down!<U+201D> Correction: October 9, 2016 An earlier version of this article incorrectly reported the period of time between when Juanita Broaddrick claimed she was raped and when she spoke with F.B.I. investigators. It was 20 years, not 10. Jillian Rayfield contributed reporting.

Wake us when President-elect Trump makes his picks. Yet despite this media melodrama, the process is exposing Mr. Trump to impressive people.

        "original_post": "Republican Donald Trump has won Ohio, a state with 18 electoral votes that his campaign considered a <U+201C>must win<U+201D> on the path to the White House. Mr. Trump was declared the victor with 53.3% of the vote when the Associated Press called the race with 68% of precincts reporting. No Republican in modern history has won the White House without also winning Ohio<U+2014>a fact that raised the stakes for Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory there. Ohio voted twice for President Barack Obama, but the state looked more in play this year. Its large population of blue-collar voters, many of whom had cast ballots for Mr. Obama or sat out of the past few elections, put their allegiances with Mr. Trump. The GOP nominee<U+2019>s success in attracting white, working-class voters raised the prospect during the campaign that the Republican Party could attempt to take an unexpected path to the White House through the largely white and slow-to-diversify upper Midwest. Mr. Trump promised to capture the Rust Belt with his populist messages on trade and immigration. Though the Clinton campaign<U+2019>s ground operation in the state was superior to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s, with many more campaign offices and a more sophisticated voter-turnout plan, early voting patterns in some counties pointed to lackluster Democratic interest. Mr. Trump also benefited from the coattails of an unparalleled door-knocking operation led by the state<U+2019>s Republican U.S. senator, Rob Portman, who is up for re-election. Demographic data isn<U+2019>t available for early voters in Ohio, but African-American turnout in early voting dropped nationwide. That may have hurt Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in Ohio. African-American turnout was central to Mr. Obama<U+2019>s Ohio wins.",

        "original_post": "In their bid to put a substantial dent in the Republican majority in the House of Representatives, Democrats closed the final fundraising period before Election Day with record fundraising hauls, putting liberal-aligned groups in a good position to out-spend GOP groups on House races across the country. In the period ending Oct. 19, the House Democrats<U+2019> campaign arm raised $10 million, their best October on record, according to a spokeswoman. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee raised more than $176 million in total through the election cycle. An affiliated super PAC, House Majority PAC, raised $14.8 million during the same October period, for a total of more than $48 million. Groups backing House Republicans brought in less money . The National Republican Congressional Committee raised $8.3 million as of Oct. 19, for a total of $139 million through the cycle. The primary House GOP super PAC, Congressional Leadership Fund, raised $5.4 million in October, bringing its group<U+2019>s total to $43.5 million. The Democrats<U+2019> fundraising advantage has allowed them to out-spend Republicans on TV advertisements across the map, according to officials on both sides. That is partly due to the fact that Republican groups are being forced to defend districts considered safe earlier this year. Nonpartisan analysts think it unlikely the Democrats can win the net 30 seats they need to claim the House majority, but expect them to pick up 10 to 20 seats. Democrats are also benefiting from the help of outside groups spending money in House contests as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump <U+2019>s slide in the polls tilts the election landscape in favor of Democrats. This week, Priorities USA, the main super PAC backing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, began airing its first ad in a House race, backing Monica Vernon against incumbent Republican Rep. Rod Blum of Iowa. Increasingly confident of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s victory in the presidential race, environmental, labor and women<U+2019>s groups are also training resources on down-ballot races. By contrast, House Republicans must rely primarily on their campaign arm and affiliated super PAC, which have proved less prodigious fundraisers than Democrats. Senate Republicans are facing a similar lack of outside advertising support this year, as groups such as Freedom Partners, a super PAC backed by the Koch Brothers, shift their resources to on-the-ground efforts. The NRCC and the Congressional Leadership Fund did close Oct. 19 with more cash in the bank than their Democratic counterparts. House Republicans<U+2019> campaign arm had $26.5 million, compared with Democrats<U+2019> $21.6 million. Congressional Leadership Fund entered late October with $15.2 million on hand, compared with $11.3 million for their Democratic counterparts. Still, operatives on both sides say the slight GOP cash advantage isn<U+2019>t enough to erase Democrats<U+2019> overall lead.

        "original_post": "In his eulogy recently for Israeli statesman Shimon Peres, President Obama spoke of the <U+201C>unfinished business<U+201D> of Israeli-Palestinian peace. Now he or Donald Trump have an opportunity to advance the cause<U+2014>by backing legislation to stop the flow of U.S. tax dollars to Palestinian terrorists. Since the 1990s, as the U.S. and other countries have sent billions of dollars in aid to the Palestinians, Palestinian leaders have paid hundreds of millions of dollars in rewards to those who carry out bombings, stabbings and other attacks in Israel. These payments, codified in Palestinian law, are an official incentive program for murder that in any other context would be recognized as state sponsorship of terror. But the U.S. and other Western states have looked the other way while continuing to send aid, giving Palestinian leaders no incentive to stop. Senators Lindsey Graham, Dan Coats and Roy Blunt have introduced a bill to end U.S. economic aid unless Palestinian leaders stop rewarding terrorists. It<U+2019>s called the Taylor Force Act, after the 28-year-old U.S. Army veteran stabbed to death in March by a Palestinian in the Israeli city of Jaffa. Other American victims of recent Palestinian terrorism include 13-year-old Hallel Yaffa Ariel and 18-year-old Ezra Schwartz. <U+201C>They will never achieve peace when you pay one of your young men to kill someone like Taylor Force. That<U+2019>s inconsistent and it needs to stop,<U+201D> Mr. Graham (R., S.C.) says. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re not going to invest in a group of people that have laws like this. It<U+2019>s just not a good investment.<U+201D> The same Palestinian laws guarantee civil-service employment to terrorists upon their release from prison<U+2014>the bloodier their crime, the cushier their post.<U+201C>If you<U+2019>re in jail for five to six years, you come out with the civilian rank of department head or lieutenant in their security forces, you get to choose. If you<U+2019>re in jail 25 to 30 years, you become a deputy minister or a major general,<U+201D> Mr. Graham adds. Mr. Coats (R., Ind.) notes that Congress tried to stop subsidizing terror payments in 2014, but Palestinian leaders dodged that law with a <U+201C>shell game<U+201D> that passed payments through the Palestine Liberation Organization, which technically isn<U+2019>t a recipient of U.S. aid. When lawmakers raised this with the State Department they got only a <U+201C>tepid<U+201D> response, says Mr. Coats. One State Department report praised the payments as <U+201C>an effort to reintegrate<U+201D> released prisoners into society. The truth is these payments are blood-soaked gifts from a Palestinian leadership still devoted more to destroying Israel than to building a Palestinian state. This has always been the chief impediment to peace. Mr. Obama is unlikely to act in his final days, but the Trump Administration and new Congress could send a powerful message by passing the Taylor Force Act.",

        "original_post": "Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. may have become mainstays on the presidential campaign trail, but most New York City voters have no interest in either running for mayor. Eight out of 10 city voters said they don<U+2019>t want to see either of the two adult children of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump run for mayor, according to a Wall Street Journal-NBC 4 New York-Marist poll released Wednesday. Donald Trump Jr., 38, told CNN in July that he would <U+201C>love to<U+201D> run for mayor and wants to keep his <U+201C>options open,<U+201D> sparking speculation about a potential bid against Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat who is seeking re-election in 2017. The poll found 80% of voters in the overwhelmingly Democratic city said they didn<U+2019>t want to see Donald Trump Jr. run for the office; 81% said they didn<U+2019>t want to see Ivanka Trump, 34, enter the race, either. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign didn<U+2019>t return a request for comment. In the five boroughs, about 10% of active voters are registered Republicans. Before Mr. de Blasio won election in 2013, the city elected the GOP mayoral nominee five times. Mr. de Blasio<U+2019>s predecessor, Michael Bloomberg, was a lifelong Democrat who changed parties before running for City Hall; he is now unaffiliated with any party. Asked whether the Trump children might have a shot at becoming mayor, Ed Cox, chairman of the New York state Republican Party, laughed. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m sure it<U+2019>s nothing they<U+2019>re concerned about right now, nor should they be,<U+201D> he said. Nicholas Kokkinis, 25, a registered Democrat in Manhattan, said the Trump children represented much of what is wrong with America and would be riding on their father<U+2019>s coattails. <U+201C>I pretty much detest the Trump brand name,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m not even sure where to start.<U+201D> Joe Katz, a 91-year-old Republican from Queens, said having one of the Trump children run the city wasn<U+2019>t a bad idea. <U+201C>I wouldn<U+2019>t be opposed to that,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>Anybody but de Blasio.<U+201D> Eric Phillips, a spokesman for the mayor, said the Trumps don<U+2019>t stand a chance. City Councilman Joseph Borelli, a Staten Island Republican and frequent surrogate for the GOP presidential nominee, said he believed New Yorkers misunderstood the Trumps, especially Ivanka, who he said would be his favored Trump to run for mayor. <U+201C>People fail to realize how independently successful she is,<U+201D> Mr. Borelli said, referring to Ms. Trump<U+2019>s clothing line. <U+201C>She<U+2019>s a very strong woman in a male-dominated field.<U+201D> Write to Mara Gay at mara.gay@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "The New York Observer, the salmon-colored society paper owned by President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is closing its weekly print edition and will go online only, the company has announced. In a memo to readers on Friday, Joseph Meyer, the chairman and chief executive of Observer Media, the publication<U+2019>s parent company, said that the move was driven by market realities as readers migrate online and away from the printed edition. <U+201C>We reach more people in an hour online than we reach in a week through print, and will continue to focus on bringing our content to readers wherever they are, via new digital, social, and mobile platforms,<U+201D> wrote Mr. Meyer, who is Mr. Kushner<U+2019>s brother-in-law . Mr. Meyer said the Nov. 9 issue was the Observer<U+2019>s last. In shifting its content entirely online, <U+201C>New York<U+201D> will be dropped from the title to reflect the broader national focus of the publication since it rebranded its website as simply Observer.com in 2015. Mr. Kushner, the heir to a real-estate empire founded by his father and a close adviser to Mr. Trump, acquired the paper in 2006. In the months leading up to the election, Mr. Kushner had reached out to media executives about launching a television venture built around Mr. Trump<U+2019>s appeal, people familiar with the matter had said. The weekly paper dates to 1987 when it was founded by former investment banker Arthur Carter to chronicle city culture, media, politics and real estate for a well-heeled audience residing mostly on Manhattan<U+2019>s Upper East Side. The paper became a proving ground for many young writers, and in the mid-1990s featured Candace Bushnell <U+2019>s column on which the HBO series <U+2018>Sex and the City<U+201D> was based. The end of the Observer<U+2019>s print edition comes at a rocky time for the newspaper industry. Print advertising sales are plunging even faster this year, leading many publishers to cut jobs, trim print editions and broadly rethink their business models. A spokesman for the Observer said the closure of the print edition resulted in some staff members being let go but that more people would ultimately be hired as the publication seeks to expand the areas it covers.

        "original_post": "WASHINGTON<U+2014>Americans<U+2019> optimism about the economy came roaring back in November, hitting a nine-year high as the economy heads into the key holiday shopping season. The Conference Board said Tuesday its index of consumer confidence jumped to 107.1 in November after dropping to an upwardly revised 100.8 in October. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected the index to rise to 101.8 in November. Tuesday<U+2019>s report is <U+201C>consistent with an improving labor market and solid growth in consumer spending,<U+201D> said Jim O<U+2019>Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, Ltd. The results showed consumers shrugging off uncertainty ahead of the U.S. presidential election, as most people in the survey were contacted before Nov. 8. A small sample of respondents was polled following the election, with a cutoff date of Nov. 15. <U+201C>Whether the increase reflects merely relief that it<U+2019>s over or joy on the part of Trump supporters is unclear, but the bottom line is that the index is now at its highest since July 2007,<U+201D> said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Consumers<U+2019> assessment of both current and future economic conditions strengthened over the month, with the present situation Index rebounding strongly to 130.3, from 123.1 in October. The expectations index hit 91.7, up from 86.0. Consumers<U+2019> outlook for the labor market also improved, with slightly more saying jobs were <U+201C>plentiful<U+201D> than in October. The monthly employment report will be released Friday by the Labor Department. <U+201C>November was a rare case when all of the various consumer confidence measures moved decisively in the same direction, which raises the likelihood that moods actually may have changed in a meaningful way,<U+201D> said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities. Mr. Shepherdson said the expectations index<U+2019>s level is consistent with real consumer spending rising by about 3.5% annually, but he noted that pace of gains isn't sustainable relative to real income growth closer to 2.5%. The survey showed consumers<U+2019> expectations for inflation rates 12 months hence dropped to 4.7% from 4.8% in October, and down from 5.0% in September. Economists track confidence because when consumers are upbeat, they are more likely to boost personal spending, which accounts for the bulk of the U.S. economy. New figures on consumer spending showed it advancing 2.8% in the third quarter, according to revised figures released Tuesday by the Commerce Department. That helped drive U.S. gross domestic product to its strongest quarterly growth in two years. The Conference Board<U+2019>s index had risen to 103.5 in September before dropping in October. That was consistent with rising personal spending and retail sales in September. Retail sales then posted another brisk gain in October. That suggests Americans had felt comfortable opening up their wallets for several months leading up to the U.S. election. A separate measure of consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan also showed sentiment rose in November. Write to Anna Louie Sussman at anna.sussman@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "We were a sleep-deprived nation Wednesday. Preliminary results from the wearable device company Fitbit found that its U.S. users on average slept about 30 minutes less on election night than the prior two Tuesday nights. That<U+2019>s a statistically significant difference, and especially large given that sleep data from the 10 million Fibit users nationwide usually varies by a minute or two from night to night. Wearable device companies had previously reported data showing that the election<U+2014> particularly debate nights <U+2014>resulted in Americans losing sleep in statistically significant amounts. But those numbers paled in comparison to election night. On the night of the first presidential debate, for example, Fitbit users nationwide slept an average of 4.2 minutes less than they did the Monday before and the Monday after the debate. The San Francisco-based Fitbit gets its data when users sync their trackers wirelessly to mobile devices or computers through an app that displays their personal stats. Fitbit analyzes the aggregated data after removing identifying information. Data from two other wearables companies also showed users losing statistically significant amounts of sleep on presidential debate nights. Those who own wearable devices tend to skew younger and wealthier than likely voters. Write to Sumathi Reddy at sumathi.reddy@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "The biggest <U+201C> super PAC <U+201D> in the presidential race is opening up a last-minute burst of advertising on Hillary Clinton <U+2019>s behalf, seeking to bolster her in three hotly contested states as she fends off renewed questions about her private email server . The group, Priorities USA Action, is spreading $6 million across nine television markets in three states, according to a Democratic media buyer. Some of the spending will occur in Wisconsin, a state where the group had not previously spent any money this election and where Donald J. Trump is running close to Mrs. Clinton. Priorities USA Action will also spend money in Miami and Jacksonville, Fla., for the first time, while adding to its spending across cities in Pennsylvania. It was not clear which ads the group planned to run, although it has largely focused on commercials attacking Mr. Trump. One recent ad features audio in which Mr. Trump can be heard rating women<U+2019>s appearances . Another offers voters a rapid-fire compilation of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s most provocative or offensive statements about women, the disabled and nuclear war. The wave of advertising comes as Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign is devoting additional firepower to North Carolina, a state where she leads Mr. Trump. Taken together, the new efforts suggest a kind of pincher move against Mr. Trump, with Mrs. Clinton hoping to make North Carolina, traditionally a Republican-leaning state, unobtainable for the Republican nominee, while the super PAC seeks to cut off Mr. Trump<U+2019>s electoral exit routes , which would require him to win Pennsylvania or perform well in Wisconsin and other states in the Upper Midwest. As of Oct. 19, Priorities USA Action had $15 million in cash on hand, according to documents filed with the Federal Election Commission.

        "original_post": "President-elect Donald Trump said Friday he will nominate Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency, which would place the former Army officer and five-year member of Congress at the helm of the spy agency that has been heavily involved in global counterterrorism operations since the 2001 terror attacks. Name: Mike Pompeo Age: 52 Education: U.S. Military Academy at West Point, Harvard Law School Background: After graduating from West Point, Mr. Pompeo served as a cavalry officer <U+201C>patrolling the Iron Curtain<U+201D> before the fall of the Berlin Wall, and he served with the 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry in the Fourth Infantry Division, according to the biography on his congressional website . He went to Harvard after he left active duty, later returning home to Kansas to run two small businesses before he was elected to the House in 2010 as part of the tea-party wave. He is a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Intelligence Committee, and he was a member of the special committee investigating the 2012 attacks on the diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. Outlook: Mr. Pompeo would take the reins of the CIA as Mr. Trump said on the campaign trail he wanted to bring back the practice of harsh interrogation methods including waterboarding and <U+201C>a hell of a lot worse,<U+201D> as well as refilling the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with prisoners. Those views have prompted some concern among former military officers and intelligence officials. The current CIA director, John Brennan, in 2014 publicly distanced the agency from its use of the controversial interrogation techniques after a scathing Senate report found them to be ineffective. While in Congress, Mr. Pompeo emerged as a staunch critic of the Obama administration<U+2019>s pursuit of an agreement with Iran to curb its nuclear program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. After Republicans failed to scuttle the deal, Mr. Pompeo became active in the push to hold Iran to account for noncompliance and repeatedly has pledged to work to undo the deal. At the CIA, he would have more access to secret information about Iran<U+2019>s activities since the deal took effect earlier this year. Messrs. Pompeo and Trump also would have latitude to broaden the U.S. use of targeted killings in drone strikes and the use of indefinite detention and military tribunals for those suspected of terrorism. President Barack Obama took steps to limit the U.S. use of these practices, but he didn<U+2019>t eliminate them outright. Mr. Brennan undertook a massive reorganization of the CIA last year. Mr. Pompeo, if confirmed by the Senate, would have to decide whether to preserve that system or try something else. Write to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Mining and metals company stocks surged on Wednesday after the election of Donald Trump, as investors looked to the president-elect<U+2019>s promises to revive U.S. manufacturing and rehabilitate the country<U+2019>s aging infrastructure. Swiss commodities giant Glencore PLC was up 3% while the world<U+2019>s second largest miner by market value, Rio Tinto PLC gained 2.5%. ArcelorMittal , the world<U+2019>s largest steelmaker, was up 3.9%. Overall, in London, the FTSE 350 mining index was up 3.4% compared with a 0.2% drop in the FTSE 100 index. Among the biggest winners here was Mexican precious metals producer Fresnillo PLC, which rose 9%. <U+201C>The market is telling you that the mining sector is the biggest beneficiary of a Trump election, particularly precious metals,<U+201D> said Jeremy Wrathall, senior analyst at Investec Securities. Mr. Trump had made rejuvenating the U.S. coal industry a large part of his platform, but that wasn<U+2019>t seen as the main factor driving global mining company stocks higher. Other reasons include a weakening dollar, making it cheaper to purchase U.S. dollar denominated commodities. Both copper and nickel were up 2.7% and 2.9% respectively. Over the longer term, investors expect Mr. Trump<U+2019>s promise to spend more on infrastructure, hospitals, highways and railways to result in extra demand for commodities such as copper, steel and aluminum. This <U+201C>volume effect would take at least a year or so<U+201D> to hit miners<U+2019> earnings, said Mr. Wrathall. Mr. Trump has also called upon Mexico to pay for the construction of a long wall on the U.S. border and to revisit trade agreements with key partners to extract a fairer deal. The Mexican peso fell to its lowest level ever against the U.S. dollar as a result, following Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s promises have appealed to many voters in the rust belt-states that were formerly a bastion of U.S. manufacturing but which are now suffering from increased competition abroad. It has also raised the specter of economic uncertainty among some investors who fear Mr. Trump<U+2019>s talk of protectionist trade policies and higher fiscal spending could hinder U.S. growth prospects, according to Liberum Capital analyst Richard Knights. Investors responded by piling out of the U.S. dollar to invest in gold, a safe-haven asset class that investors typically flock to amid economic uncertainty as a way to preserve capital. Spot gold was up 2.2% at $1,302 an ounce. The gold price rise spurred shares in West Africa<U+2019>s Randgold Resources Ltd. and Russia<U+2019>s Polymetal International PLC to rise 7.9% and 6.5% respectively. Fresnillo, however, climbed the most out of the U.K.<U+2019>s FTSE 100 index given that it earns all of its revenue in U.S. dollars (through the sale of gold and silver) and incurs a significant chunk of its costs in Mexican pesos. This means its profit margin should expand in U.S. dollar denominated terms due to gold and currency movements. Write to Alex MacDonald at alex.macdonald@wsj.com",

Mr. Trump said the deal is <U+201C>an example of the power structure I am fighting.<U+201D> AT&T, the country<U+2019>s second largest wireless company, reached a deal this weekend to acquire Time Warner, one of the largest content companies in the U.S. with networks like CNN and HBO, according to people familiar with the transaction. AT&T also owns DirecTV, one of the largest pay-television firms. Mr. Trump also said he never would have approved Comcast Corp. <U+2019>s 2011 acquisition of NBCUniversal, which similarly combined content and distribution companies.

And we<U+2019>ll look at breaking that deal up and other deals like that.

John Bentel, who served as a top information technology staffer during Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s time as secretary of state, declined to answer more than 90 questions as part of a deposition in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the State Department, according to the<U+00A0>conservative group Judicial Watch, which brought the lawsuit. As part of the suit, Judicial Watch was granted permission to interview a number of current and former State Department officials about how and why Mrs. Clinton used a home-based email server for all her government business. The lawsuit seeks records from Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s time in office. A judge also ordered Mrs. Clinton to answer written questions but declined to require her to testify in person. She isn't a defendant in the lawsuit. <U+201C>As is standard, the department cannot comment as this matter is in ongoing litigation. Beyond that, we would refer you to Mr. Bentel and his representatives,<U+201D> a State Department official said. Two attorneys for Mr. Bentel didn<U+2019>t immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Bentel is the second former State Department official to avoid answering questions as part of Judicial Watch<U+2019>s lawsuit. Bryan Pagliano, who helped set up Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s server, also invoked his right against self-incrimination when testifying as part of the lawsuit. Cheryl Mills, who served as Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s chief of staff in government and her lawyer, cited rules protecting attorney-client privilege to avoid answering a number of questions. <U+201C>The fact that yet another State Department official took the Fifth highlights the disturbing implication that criminal acts took place related to the Clinton email and our Freedom of Information Act requests,<U+201D> said Judicial Watch<U+2019>s president, Tom Fitton. The Fifth Amendment protects the right of Americans not give statements that might implicate them in a crime and isn't an admission of guilt or criminal activity.

        "original_post": "TRENTON<U+2014>New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is haunted by two story lines this holiday season: the fallout from the criminal convictions of two of his former associates, and speculation over whether he will join the administration of President-elect Donald Trump. So, anticipation swirled after his office said the Republican governor would hold a news conference on an undisclosed topic Tuesday. It turned out to be an announcement on a $300 million, four-year renovation of the New Jersey Statehouse. The governor acknowledged the large media presence. <U+201C>I want you all to take a deep breath and relax,<U+201D> he said. Although he didn<U+2019>t completely close the door on joining the Trump administration, Mr. Christie issued his strongest statement yet that he intends to stay in Trenton until January 2018. He is prevented by term limits from seeking re-election again. <U+201C>I am telling you that I am completing my term,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m not going anywhere.<U+201D> A spokesman for the state Department of the Treasury said the renovation likely would be paid for using long-term debt. Renovations will include the installation of fire sprinklers, chimney and window repairs, and a revamp of the heating, cooling and ventilation system. The Statehouse dates to 1792. Work is to start immediately. The governor took no questions from reporters, and he ignored a shouted question from Wayne resident Bill Brennan, an activist who is pursuing an official misconduct case against Mr. Christie. A Bergen County judge found probable cause in the case and issued a criminal summons in October against Mr. Christie. The governor<U+2019>s private attorneys, state prosecutors and Mr. Brennan are scheduled to appear in court on the matter Wednesday. Mr. Christie has appealed the complaint, which a spokesman has described as <U+201C>dishonorable.<U+201D> Write to Kate King at Kate.King@wsj.com",

Trump transition official Steven Mnuchin, who is considered a candidate for treasury secretary, told reporters in New York that he and Mr. Trump had already discussed their proposed tax-code rewrite. <U+201C>I think the other thing<U+2014>very big focus<U+2014>is regulatory changes, looking at the creation of an infrastructure bank to fund infrastructure investments,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>We want to be in a position where in the first 100 days we can execute the economic plan.<U+201D> Last month, two other economic advisers to Mr. Trump sketched out a proposal for $1 trillion in new infrastructure construction over 10 years that relies entirely on private financing. To jump-start the building projects, the government would provide tax credits to developers. That paper, from economist Peter Navarro and financier Wilbur Ross, didn<U+2019>t specifically reference an infrastructure bank, and instead criticized a proposed infrastructure bank by Democratic rival Hillary Clinton as a <U+201C>high-risk<U+2026>leveraging scheme<U+201D> that was potentially as <U+201C>rife with economic problems as it is with the prospect of crony capitalism.<U+201D> David Malpass, an economist who is overseeing economic policy in the Trump transition, told economists last month any infrastructure program would focus primarily on attracting private investment, and reducing permitting and other hurdles to construction. <U+201C>What<U+2019>s broken in the system is not the sources of financing for infrastructure, but the obstacles to actually getting it built,<U+201D> Mr. Malpass said. Given the large amounts of cash earning little because of low and negative interest rates around the world, <U+201C>All I have to do is show you an infrastructure project that returns zero<U+2026>and it<U+2019>s going to break even,<U+201D> said Mr. Malpass.

        "original_post": "The battle for the House of Representatives can be hard to follow on election night, involving three dozen swing seats scattered across the country among 435 total races. Analysts say Democrats will win anywhere from five to 20 seat s, short of the 30 they need to regain control of the chamber. Here are some of the bellwether races to watch: Rep. Darrell Issa (R) vs. Doug Applegate (D) California<U+2019>s 49th Congressional District The struggle for survival by Rep. Issa, an eight-term congressman, makes for one of the highest-profile House races. Mr. Applegate, running as an outsider, is a former Marine colonel whose middle-class life contrasts with Mr. Issa<U+2019>s status as the richest man in Congress. Mr. Issa is a staunch Donald Trump supporter and critic of President Barack Obama, but he has tried to tack the other way in the campaign, circulating mailers that highlight his work with Mr. Obama. The president called that tactic <U+201C>the definition of chutzpah.<U+201D> Rep. John Mica (R) vs. Stephanie Murphy (D) Florida<U+2019>s Seventh Congressional District Rep. Mica, 73, faces a significant challenge in battling the 38-year-old Ms. Murphy, who works at an investment firm and teaches at a local college. The district was recently redrawn, putting Mr. Mica into a suburban area with a younger, more racially diverse population that tends to align with Democrats. Rep. Will Hurd (R) vs. Pete Gallego (D) Texas<U+2019> 23rd Congressional District Former Rep. Pete Gallego is trying to retake a seat he lost in 2014, when Republicans swept the midterm elections. The race is unfolding in a heavily Latino district that shares a more than 800-mile border with Mexico, and the rematch will be closely watched for signs that Democrats are being helped by Hispanic outrage at Mr. Trump<U+2019>s positions and remarks on immigration. Rep. Rick Nolan (D) vs. Stewart Mills (R) Minnesota<U+2019>s Eighth Congressional District Rep. Nolan is in a tight race with Mr. Mills, who in 2014 tried to oust him but lost amid a fuss over his shoulder-length hair. This time around, Mr. Mills has cut his hair and cast himself as a conservative, to benefit from Mr. Trump<U+2019>s popularity among the white working-class voters who populate the district. Rep. Barbara Comstock (R) vs. LuAnn Bennett (D) Virginia<U+2019>s 10th Congressional District Rep. Comstock aims to hang on to this district, which spans exurban and suburban areas outside Washington, D.C., by putting the maximum distance between herself and Mr. Trump. Last month, she said she couldn<U+2019>t in good conscience vote for the GOP presidential nominee. Republicans have fought hard to keep the seat; House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) has campaigned with Ms. Comstock multiple times and raised money for her. Democrats have poured in millions to boost Ms. Bennett, who runs a real-estate company. Write to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "SolarCity Corp. reported a third-quarter loss of $225.3 million on sales of just $201 million, eight days before shareholders vote on its planned merger with Tesla Motors Inc. The San Mateo, Calif.-based solar panel-installer narrowly beat analyst expectations, and the financial results were slightly better than the same period of last year when the company posted a loss of $234.3 million on $114 million in revenue. Shares of SolarCity traded 0.6% higher after hours around $20.12, after closing<U+00A0>down 4% on Wednesday. Many solar energy stocks tumbled after news broke that Republican nominee Donald Trump was elected president. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he wants to repeal federal tax subsidies for renewable energy. SolarCity installed 187 megawatts of solar panels during the third quarter, down from 256 megawatts installed in the same quarter of 2015. At the same time, operating expenses rose 19% to $258 million. Elon Musk, who is chairman of both SolarCity and Tesla, said earlier this month that SolarCity would add more than $500 million of cash to Tesla<U+2019>s balance sheet, and that the solar panel installer would contribute more than $1 billion in revenue next year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect SolarCity to report 2016 sales of $694 million, rising to $939 million in 2017. The company plans to start building a new type of solar roofing product next year in conjunction with Tesla at a factory in Buffalo, N.Y., but didn<U+2019>t offer any new details about how it would finance the operation. The product is part of Mr. Musk<U+2019>s vision for how the two companies<U+2019> combination would result in an integrated system of solar panels, wall-mounted batteries and electric cars. SolarCity has an agreement with state officials to spend $5 billion over 10 years at the factory, and the state is spending $750 million on construction and equipment for the project. SolarCity said it wouldn<U+2019>t hold a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss results this week, pending the outcome of the shareholder vote set for Nov. 17.

        "original_post": "Having embraced Donald Trump for the presidency, the National Rifle Association is planning a major push to nationalize its <U+201C>concealed carry<U+201D> campaign, which has already enabled millions of citizens to go armed into public places in the name of self-defense. Republican lawmakers, ever enthusiastic about the gun lobby<U+2019>s agenda, will control both houses of Congress next year when Mr. Trump assumes the presidency. His campaign celebrated the N.R.A.<U+2019>s fantasy that citizens can stand up to gunmen by shooting it out. Research refutes this idea; it is far more likely that guns are used to harm the owners or other innocent people than to stop a crime. There were eight million Americans with concealed-carry permits in 2012, according to federal data. That number has been growing rapidly with the gun lobby<U+2019>s success in loosening state restrictions, making it possible for permit holders to pack guns in university classes and many public venues. The N.R.A. goal in the Trump administration is to pass an expansive national law that would require states to recognize concealed-carry permits issued by other states. Varying Republican proposals in Congress range from focusing on a special permit applicable in all states to a broad mandate that would force states with tight restrictions to accept a visitor<U+2019>s right to carry a weapon, even if that person came from a state with lax permit standards or no permit requirement at all. Concealed-carry laws have helped to create a booming market for the gun industry. This was clear in the shopping spree after Thanksgiving , when there were a record 185,713 gun sales processed on Black Friday alone by the federal background check agency. The allure of customized small pistols (<U+201C>What color do you want?<U+201D>) can make them seem bling-like as a fashion accessory. But since 2007, concealed-carry permit holders have been responsible for at least 898 deaths not involving self-defense, according to the Violence Policy Center, a gun safety group. This includes 29 mass shootings by permit holders who killed 139 people. Separate research has found that despite the overwhelming number of guns in America, they are very rarely used in self-defense or to stop crimes. The self-defense myth of concealed carry nevertheless carries on, at the expense of public safety.

        "original_post": "Carrier Corp. has agreed to keep in Indiana roughly half of the 2,100 jobs it had planned to shift to Mexico, after a lobbying effort from the incoming Trump administration. In exchange for keeping about 1,000 jobs in Indiana, the company will receive new government incentives, said a person familiar with the matter. The terms of the agreement couldn<U+2019>t immediately be learned. Carrier, a division of United Technologies Corp. that makes heating and air conditioning equipment, had announced plans earlier this year to shift some production to Monterrey, Mexico, as part of a broader corporate cost-cutting. The decision became a target during the presidential campaign of Donald Trump, who pledged to prevent such outsourcing or punish U.S. firms that shifted jobs abroad. In a statement posted Tuesday to its Twitter account, Carrier said the company was <U+201C>pleased to have reached a deal with President-elect Trump & VP-elect Pence to keep close to 1,000 jobs in Indy. More details soon.<U+201D> Mr. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence are expected to travel to Indiana on Thursday to announce the details of the agreement with Carrier. Trump transition officials have been in close contact with Carrier and United Technologies executives for weeks trying to iron out specifics of the package. <U+201C>If they<U+2019>re saving us some jobs, anything<U+2019>s positive,<U+201D> said Chuck Jones, president of United Steelworkers Local 1999 in Indianapolis. Union leaders had complained this year about Carrier<U+2019>s lack of cooperation with workers on the plans for closing the plant. The news was reported earlier by CNBC and the New York Times . Mr. Pence, who is governor of Indiana, had taken the lead in negotiating with United Technologies officials, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Mr. Pence has held wide-ranging talks with the company in the weeks since the presidential election, which focused not just on Mr. Trump<U+2019>s objections to the North American Free Trade Agreement and free trade, but also on key priorities for the company in the coming Republican Congress, including an expected tax reform package that could hold windfalls for big manufacturers like United Technologies. Mr. Pence has also in the past held the company to account for its plans to close the two affected plants<U+2014>a Carrier Corp. factory in Indianapolis employing 1,400 workers and another factory in Huntington, Ind. for its electronic controls unit employing 700. The governor negotiated a deal earlier this year under which he clawed back state and municipal incentives previously granted to Carrier, after the company<U+2019>s February announcement that it would leave for Mexico. Mr. Trump lambasted the move on the campaign trail this year, at one point suggesting he would impose a 35% tariff on Carrier products made in Mexico that it shipped to the U.S. But lately he has presented a more friendly side, tweeting on Thanksgiving Day that he was <U+201C>making progress<U+201D> convincing the company to keep jobs in Indiana. <U+2014>Damian Paletta and William Mauldin contributed to this article.

        "original_post": "MEXICO CITY--Mexican inflation moved further from the central bank<U+2019>s target in early November as a weaker peso continued to affect goods prices and a seasonal increase in residential electricity rates pushed up energy costs. The Consumer Price Index rose 0.77% in the first two weeks of the month, moving the annual rate up to 3.29% from 3.06% at the end of October, the National Statistics Institute said Thursday. Core CPI, which excludes energy and fresh fruit and vegetables, rose 0.23% in the period to an annual rate of 3.33%. The increases were above the median estimates of economists polled by The Wall Street Journal, which saw CPI rising 0.68% and core CPI up 0.12%. Residential electricity rates contributed the most to November<U+2019>s inflation, rising 26% as summertime subsidies applied to help households cope with the cost of air conditioning ended in 12 cities. Gasoline, airfares and the price of tourism packages also rose. The weaker peso and the risk it poses for inflation has prompted the Bank of Mexico to raise interest rates four times this year to the current 5.25% from 3.25% at the end of 2015. The central bank has also increased its forecasts for inflation, which it expects to end this year above its 3% target and stay above the target through 2017. Inflation was below 3% for 17 consecutive months through September. A number of private economists have raised their forecasts for next year above 4%, partly as a result of peso depreciation following the election victory of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, given the impact a Trump administration could have on trade and investment. The weaker peso, which affects the cost of imports, has pushed up goods prices more than those of services. Core goods were up an annual 4.07% in mid November, while services prices were 2.71% higher. In a report his week, the central bank said it expects the difference between goods price increases and services price increases as a result of currency depreciation to continue for a relatively long time.

        "original_post": "TOKYO<U+2014>Fast Retailing Co. aims to reach 3 trillion yen ($27 billion) in sales without making major acquisitions, its chief executive said, rejecting speculation that Asia<U+2019>s biggest apparel maker would look to overseas deals to accelerate growth. Tadashi Yanai, chief executive of the company known for its Uniqlo stores, also weighed in on the U.S. presidential election, saying he was dismayed by the victory of Donald Trump and might revise his U.S. strategy unless Republicans disavow the <U+201C>America first<U+201D> stance Mr. Trump took during the campaign. Mr. Yanai recently lowered his goal for sales in the year ending August 2021 to <U+00A5>3 trillion from <U+00A5>5 trillion. The company, which had sales of <U+00A5>1.8 trillion in the year ended August 2016, has been expanding rapidly in China. <U+201C>We can reach <U+00A5>3 trillion through organic growth,<U+201D> Mr. Yanai said in an interview Thursday. The earlier, more ambitious target had led to speculation that Fast Retailing would need to make a major overseas acquisition. Many cash-rich Japanese companies, such as banks, life insurers and pharmaceutical companies, have been making multibillion-dollar acquisitions in places such as the U.S., where they expect faster growth than at home. In 2014, Fast Retailing held merger discussions with apparel chain J. Crew Group Inc. , people familiar with the matter said at the time. But the talks broke down and no deal was reached. In the interview, Mr. Yanai said he wasn<U+2019>t interested in J. Crew, citing its recent sales slump . Instead, he said the growth would come from Uniqlo and a lower-priced Fast Retailing chain called GU<U+2014>pronounced <U+201C>gee-you,<U+201D> which means <U+201C>freedom<U+201D> in Japanese. GU was created in 2006 and offers more trendy fashion lines compared with the more basic Uniqlo styles. Mr. Yanai said he hoped to expand GU<U+2019>s presence in Asia and eventually bring the brand to the U.S. He suggested that Uniqlo and GU could somehow merge in the future, without giving details. Uniqlo remains the company<U+2019>s flagship brand, with 1,795 stores globally, including 837 in Japan as of August. Uniqlo has scaled back ambitions to be a national player in the U.S., where it has 45 stores. Mr. Yanai said he wanted to focus on big cities, where customers appreciate the quality of the clothes and follow fashion trends. He expressed irritation at Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory, describing the Republican<U+2019>s policies as <U+201C>exclusionary<U+201D> and out of step with American traditions. <U+201C>I have to wonder: Isn<U+2019>t it embarrassing for America to have elected that kind of person as president?<U+201D> Mr. Yanai said. <U+201C>What I<U+2019>m hoping is that people of conscience in the Republican Party will try harder and make sure that they don<U+2019>t let the kind of things Trump is thinking of actually happen.<U+201D> If Mr. Trump carries out the policies he described in the campaign, Mr. Yanai said he would focus his U.S. strategy even more on urban centers.

In a statement before flying to Peru to attend the annual summit of Asia-Pacific leaders, Mr. Duterte also said the United Nations has been useless in stopping wars. He said if China and Russia decide to create a new world order, he would be the first to join them and leave the U.N., which he said was dominated by the U.S. <U+201C>You know, if China and Russia would decide to create a new order, I would be the first to join,<U+201D> he said, adding that he would quit the U.N. Mr. Duterte also criticized the global agreement to fight climate change, saying there are no penalties for violators and it isn<U+2019>t clear which industrialized countries will contribute money to support developing countries<U+2019> efforts against global warming. He said that was the reason why President-elect Donald Trump doesn't want the U.S. to spend on fighting climate change. During his campaign, Mr. Trump said he would pull the U.S. out of the Paris pact on climate change. The foul-mouthed Mr. Duterte said that like Russia, he might withdraw from the ICC <U+201C>because we the small ones are the only ones being beaten up,<U+201D> but nothing has been done for the thousands of children and women dying in bombings in Syria and Iraq. Mr. Duterte is expected to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the sidelines of the summit in Lima. He requested for the bilateral meeting because he wants to meet and be friends with Mr. Putin, whom he said was his idol. Human-rights advocates have criticized Mr. Duterte<U+2019>s antidrug campaign that has left more than 4,000 suspected addicts and pushers dead since July. They said the killings can be a basis to charge him for crimes against humanity before the Netherlands-based court. Mr. Duterte said he has intentionally used foul language<U+2014> including calling President Barack Obama a <U+201C>son of a bitch<U+201D> <U+2014>because Mr. Obama has trivialized the Philippines<U+2019> drug problem when there are already around 4 million Filipinos addicted to drugs.

        "original_post": "Petr<U+00F3>leos de Venezuela SA missed $404 million in coupon payments on three of its bonds, highlighting the continued struggles of the Venezuelan state oil company. The company, which is often known as PdVSA, failed to make payments last week on bonds maturing in 2021, 2024 and 2035, according to J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. In a note to clients, J.P. Morgan cited reports from PdVSA<U+2019>s paying agent Citigroup and Clearstream, a clearinghouse that handles the payments. PdVSA didn<U+2019>t respond to a request for comment. PdVSA now is in technical default and will have a 30-day grace period to cure the default if it makes the payments, analysts said. <U+201C>We still believe PdVSA will make these payments,<U+201D> the J.P. Morgan analysts said. They pointed to Venezuela<U+2019>s reported $10.9 billion international reserves as of Nov. 17 and the company<U+2019>s recent efforts to reduce its cash drain by extending the term of some bonds using a debt swap. The missed payments hit a nerve among investors because many are worried Venezuela, whose oil industry constitutes the lifeblood of its struggling economy, is believed by many to be on the verge of default. Despite the concerns, Venezuela hasn<U+2019>t missed any debt payment since 2002, according to Russ Dallen, a managing partner at Caracas Capital. PdVSA paid more than $2 billion over the past two months to its bondholders. It also made a $135 million interest payment on its 2026 notes on Tuesday, before missing payments on the three bonds on Wednesday and Thursday. Last month, PdVSA swapped $2.8 billion of 2017 notes for debt maturing in 2020, after several rounds of extensions. The debt exchange provided some relief to the struggling oil company, as it helped reduce its short-term cash squeeze. PdVSA bonds maturing in 2035 traded at 46.5 cents on dollar of par value, up from 45 cents last week. The bond currently yields 22.3%. PdVSA bond prices generally have fallen significantly since the U.S. election on Nov. 8, reflecting in part sharp increases in the value of the dollar and questions about how Trump administration policies might affect global trade. Write to Carolyn Cui at carolyn.cui@wsj.com Corrections & Amplifications: PdVSA will avoid default if it makes some bond payments within a 30-day grace period, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. said this week in a note to clients. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the company was in technical default. (Nov. 22, 2016)",

His equally famous comment (though not original to him)<U+2014><U+201C>Democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms<U+201D><U+2014>is closer to his real sentiments. Churchill<U+2019>s daughter Mary Soames, who died in 2014 after a long life as guardian of her father<U+2019>s legacy, was skeptical of attempts to invoke his name. <U+201C>How would you know?<U+201D> was her retort to <U+201C>What Winston Would Think.<U+201D> Even so, it<U+2019>s tempting to consider what he would make of American politics in 2016. No foreign statesman had a longer and deeper association with the United States. While he had deep respect for American democracy, Churchill<U+2019>s relationship with this country was sometimes troubled. In the 1920s he was vexed by America<U+2019>s international policy, and when his name was floated for Foreign Secretary, his wife Clementine cautioned against it, since his <U+201C>anti-American views<U+201D> would, in her mind, make him unsuitable. Used to the parliamentary system, Churchill could find the quadrennial spectacle of American elections unappealing. When he once was asked about running for president, he replied, facetiously, <U+201C>All that handshaking of people I didn<U+2019>t give a damn about would kill me.<U+201D> Churchill, who met most presidents from William McKinley to Dwight D. Eisenhower, was careful never to publicly endorse a specific candidate. Among presidents, his closest personal relationships were with Democrats Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, as well as Ike, a Republican. Churchill was above all a leader of principle and conviction, but undogmatic.

In the counties that are home to public flagship universities, only nine favored Donald J. Trump over Hillary Clinton, according to a Chronicle analysis of voting data. In the 49 counties included in the analysis, Mrs. Clinton beat Mr. Trump, on average, by about 18 percentage points. In counties with a public flagship, the percentage of voters favoring Mrs. Clinton was 11 points, on average, higher than her statewide percentage. . . . Among the places with large disparities between the vote in counties with flagships and the rest of the state was the home of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Orange County. There, Mrs. Clinton received 74 percent of the county-level vote, even though she lost the state overall, winning 46.7 percent of the vote. . . . The University of Maryland at College Park, in Prince George <U+2019>s County, is a striking example, too. The county gave Mrs. Clinton 89.3 percent of its vote, and Mr. Trump just 8.3 percent. At the state level, Mrs. Clinton still won<U+2014>but by a significantly slimmer margin. She got 60.5 percent of the Maryland vote.",

        "original_post": "What would you do if you saw someone yelling at a woman on a bus, telling her to take off her hijab? If you saw someone attack an African-American man and tell him Donald Trump could deport him? If you saw a man throw a woman off the sidewalk as she walked her dogs? As incidents of racist, sexist and Islamophobic harassment continue in the wake of Donald Trump<U+2019>s election, many Americans will have to ask themselves these questions. And while every situation is different, the tips below <U+2014> adapted from materials produced by the anti-street-harassment group Hollaback! and other organizations <U+2014> may help people respond if they see someone being harassed. Don<U+2019>t assume you have to confront the harasser. Directly confronting someone can be risky, because you can become a target, too. In many situations, another option is to talk to the person being harassed. You can ask if he or she needs help, or take a more indirect route by asking for the time or directions or starting a conversation about something other than the harassment. The artist Marie-Shirine Yener explains this tactic in a helpful comic . Taking the focus off of the harasser can make him or her retreat. In addition, approaching the person being harassed gives that person control over the situation <U+2014> he or she can choose to accept or decline your help or ask you to do something specific. If you don<U+2019>t talk to the person experiencing harassment, you may not know what, if anything, he or she needs from you. Ask someone else for help. If you don<U+2019>t feel safe intervening yourself, you can ask someone else to step in. That could be a law enforcement officer. But it could also be a bus driver, train conductor, teacher or other authority figure, or simply another bystander. If you can<U+2019>t intervene during the incident, you can still help afterward. Maybe you saw someone call a fellow subway passenger a derogatory name, then walk away. You can still approach the passenger and ask if she needs help. She might want someone to go with her to her destination or to help her report the incident to law enforcement or an anti-harassment group. Just hearing that someone else saw and recognized the harassment can be helpful for some people. Learn more. Hollaback! is offering online bystander intervention training on Nov. 29 and Dec. 1. The group, working with other organizations, has also posted some basic tips on the #MomentofTruth Tumblr. A web tutorial on bystander intervention and de-escalation, by the writer Jes Skolnik, also includes links to other resources. Men Can Stop Rape offers training for boys and men on bystander intervention and other violence prevention strategies. Information about how to intervene can help you do so safely and confidently if the need arises.",

        "original_post": "As emerging markets were roiled by President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s victory early<U+00A0>Wednesday, at least one surprising region seemed to shrug off the vote: Eastern Europe. The impact of the election was particularly clear in Russia, where the ruble rose by more than 1% against the dollar, compared with a fall of 1.7% for the Brazilian real, 1.8% for the South African rand and 8.05% for the battered Mexican peso. <U+201C>Russia may benefit from today<U+2019>s result should the U.S. start easing financial sanctions,<U+201D> said Claudia Calich, manager of M&G emerging market bond fund, in an email. Mr. Trump has<U+00A0>argued for a closer relationship between the U.S. and Russian governments. The MICEX index of Russian stocks was a green speck in a sea of red markets<U+00A0>on Wednesday, rising by 1.39%. Global stocks sold off almost everywhere else in the world. But other countries in Eastern Europe, which have traditionally relied on implicit U.S. protection and therefore seem to have much more to lose from Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election, seemed relatively unfazed<U+00A0>on Wednesday. The President-elect<U+2019>s foreign policy stance could have major geopolitical impact in the region, with a more isolationist<U+00A0>outlook on international affairs. Mr. Trump argued in Apri l<U+00A0>that many NATO countries are <U+201C>not paying their fair share,<U+201D> and suggested in an August interview that Russia doesn<U+2019>t have a military presence in Ukraine. Polish, Czech and Hungarian currencies were little moved against the dollar in trading<U+00A0>Wednesday.<U+00A0>The Polish zloty fell 0.4% against the dollar, the Czech koruna fell 0.24% and Hungarian forint actually rose by 0.1%. <U+201C>Markets, and EM [emerging markets] in particular, are holding up better than I expected,<U+201D> said Viktor Szabo, a senior portfolio manager at Aberdeen Asset Management . Stocks sold off slightly in some Eastern European countries, but not notably more than in developed Europe. Hungary<U+2019>s BUX was down<U+00A0>0.46%and Poland<U+2019>s was down 0.58%. But those countries show no more sign of being affected than others, and have exhibited nothing like the exposure that the Mexican peso has seen . Analysts and investors had a consensus explanation for the lack of a reaction in Eastern European assets. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s a certain risk to Donald Trump<U+2019>s stance on Russia and NATO members having to contribute more,<U+201D> said Jakob Ekholdt Christensen, head of emerging market research at Danske Bank , speaking<U+00A0>on Wednesday<U+00A0>morning. <U+201C>But these countries are more economically exposed to Europe and have less exposure to trade with the United States.<U+201D> The Mexican peso was most obviously impacted by Mr. Trump<U+2019>s surprise victory, due to the country<U+2019>s very close economic links to the United States. <U+201C>EM is looking massively more robust than I would have guessed,<U+201D><U+00A0>said Paul McNamara, emerging market investment director at GAM.<U+00A0><U+201C>I<U+2019>m very surprised.<U+201D> Write to Mike Bird at Mike.Bird@wsj.com and Christopher Whittall at christopher.whittall@wsj.com",

The network-equipment giant<U+2019>s shares fell in after-hours trading Wednesday, giving up the gains the stock has made since last week<U+2019>s election. Cisco was one of the few tech stocks to rally following the vote, as investors believed the company stood to benefit from President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s plans for big infrastructure projects, as well as a potential tax holiday for its bulging offshore bank accounts. That may all come to pass, but Cisco still has to contend with the here and now. The company<U+2019>s outlook for the quarter ending in January, which came as part of its fiscal first-quarter report Wednesday afternoon, was disappointing. Cisco projected a revenue decline between 2% and 4% year over year; analysts had been expecting a small gain. On its call, the company blamed a weak spending outlook for network service providers as the main reason for its caution. That will curb some enthusiasm for the stock, which is up 16% so far this year. It will also likely put more focus the company<U+2019>s war chest. About $71 billion sits in Cisco<U+2019>s coffers now, with about 90% residing offshore. Cisco<U+2019>s offshore cash balance is the third-largest in tech after Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Steve Milunovich of UBS estimates that if Cisco devotes half the repatriated cash to buybacks, it could retire about one-sixth of its shares. But that is still a big if, and Cisco in the meantime has to contend with the growth challenges of a mature business. Investors got ahead of themselves on the stock, and it won<U+2019>t be the first time in an unpredictable Trump era.",

Representatives of the Transport Workers Union Local 234 had no immediate comment. More than 4,700 transit workers have been off the job since early on Tuesday, when the union went on strike amid contentious contract talks. Key issues include pension benefits and health insurance coverage. The strike has halted subway, trolley and bus service that normally provides nearly 900,000 rides per day. SEPTA had previously said it would ask a judge to force transit employees back to work on Election Day, if it appeared the two sides wouldn<U+2019>t be able to reach an agreement before then. One concern is some people might not have time to vote if faced with a longer-than-usual commute.

        "original_post": "WASHINGTON<U+2014>U.S. consumer confidence matched its lowest level in two years in October as concerns about the economy grew ahead of the coming presidential election . The University of Michigan<U+2019>s consumer-sentiment index dropped to 87.2 from 91.2 a month earlier. That matched the September 2015 reading as the weakest since October 2014. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected consumer sentiment to register at 88.5. <U+201C>The October decline was due to less favorable prospects for the national economy, with half of all consumers anticipating an economic downturn sometime in the next five years for the first time since October 2014,<U+201D> said Richard Curtin, the survey<U+2019>s chief economist. Uncertainty generated by the presidential election may be weighing on households, Mr. Curtin said. But if job and wage growth continues alongside low inflation and interest rates, the consumer outlook may well improve again. The survey<U+2019>s gauge of current economic conditions fell to 103.2 in October from 104.2 in September and the index of consumer expectations declined to 76.8 from 82.7, the lowest level since September 2014.

        "original_post": "Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday fought back against accusations that the social network harmed political discourse this year by allowing fake news to flourish on the platform. <U+201C>Personally I think the idea that fake news on Facebook<U+2014>of which it<U+2019>s a very small amount of the content<U+2014>influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,<U+201D> Mr. Zuckerberg said at a conference in Half Moon Bay, Calif. He also said the company exposed its 1.8 billion monthly users to various views, countering the criticism that Facebook has created a <U+201C>filter bubble<U+201D> of like-minded people. He said the content is out there<U+2014>but users don<U+2019>t click on it. Facebook and smaller rival Twitter Inc. were key paths to news for voters this year as they assessed the two presidential candidates, Republican Donald Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. The surprise triumph of Mr. Trump has sparked considerable debate about the role of social media in shaping the race<U+2019>s often toxic and divisive rhetoric. Critics<U+2014>who tend to be left-leaning<U+2014>say the company needs to do more to ensure that fake news doesn<U+2019>t spread rapidly across the social network, potentially misinforming voters. Mr. Zuckerberg said that argument reflected a lack of empathy for why voters favored Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton. <U+201C>Why would you think fake news would be on one side, but not on the other?<U+201D> he said. Internal research proved that Facebook<U+2019>s algorithm doesn<U+2019>t create a filter bubble, Mr. Zuckerberg said, and the site offers a wide range of information from a variety of perspectives. <U+201C>Right now the problem isn<U+2019>t that diverse information isn<U+2019>t there<U+2026>but we haven<U+2019>t gotten people to engage with it in higher proportions,<U+201D> he said on stage. Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook was still finding the right balance between protecting user safety and free speech. Last December, Mr. Zuckerberg and other top Facebook executives agreed to maintain Mr. Trump<U+2019>s posts on his Facebook page despite the fact that two posts calling for a ban on Muslims from entering the U.S. violated the site<U+2019>s rules for hate speech, The Wall Street Journal reported last month. Asked about the decision on stage, Mr. Zuckerberg said the site is weighing <U+201C>newsworthiness as a higher part of the community guidelines.<U+201D> He said the site had to be careful when removing posts published by the president-elect, who has nearly 15 million followers on Facebook. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s mainstream political discourse and we need to be pretty careful,<U+201D> he said.

Mr Egeland ruled out airdrops of food, explaining that they were not possible in densely-populated urban areas. Government forces launched a major assault on eastern Aleppo in September. Since then, troops have pushed into several outlying areas with the help of Iranian-backed Shia militias and Russian air strikes. Rebels launched a counter-attack in an attempt to break the siege in late October. But their progress slowed after early gains.",

        "original_post": "The last election night that two New Yorkers duked it out for the presidency, a guy named Dewey set up camp at a hotel named Roosevelt. The year was 1944, and Thomas E. Dewey, the G.O.P. candidate and the governor of New York, conceded to his Democratic opponent, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt , at the Republican National Headquarters at the Hotel Roosevelt. The hotel was named for Roosevelt<U+2019>s cousin, former President Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt had soundly defeated Dewey in the Electoral College vote, 432 to 99, and Dewey gave his concession statement just after 3 a.m. on Nov. 8. Dewey said, <U+201C>It is clear that Mr. Roosevelt has been re-elected for a fourth term, and every good American will wholeheartedly accept the will of the people,<U+201D> according to The New York Times . <U+201C>I extend to President Roosevelt my hearty congratulations and my earnest hope that his next term will see speedy victory in the war, the establishment of lasting peace and the restoration of tranquullity [sic] among our peoples,<U+201D> he added. World War II ended the following year . In response, Roosevelt, who was at his home in Hyde Park, N.Y., and heard the concession speech over the radio, dispatched the following telegram to Dewey: <U+201C>I thank you for your statement which I have heard over the air a few minutes ago.<U+201D> Earlier on Election Day, Dewey told his staff that \"whatever the result, I think we have made a mighty contribution toward the unity of our country, toward the war effort and the peace to come.<U+201D> At the time, the Democratic national headquarters was in the Biltmore Hotel, on New York<U+2019>s Madison Avenue. This time, Donald J. Trump , the Republican nominee, will be watching from the New York Hilton Midtown, a few blocks from his Trump Tower home. Hillary Clinton , the Democratic nominee, will be at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on the West Side of Manhattan.

        "original_post": "Donald Trump will be the first U.S. president since Ronald Reagan to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but he didn<U+2019>t win many friends in show business during the campaign. Deep-pocketed celebrities and executives like <U+201C>Star Wars: The Force Awakens<U+201D> director J.J. Abrams and mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg repeatedly feted Hillary Clinton during the campaign; a Clinton presidency would have assured Hollywood had a friend in the White House. Mr. Trump is a different story. He received barely any support from Hollywood figures during the campaign, and routinely picked fights with some. Most relevant to Hollywood<U+2019>s business is Mr. Trump<U+2019>s rhetoric on China, which will likely become the nation<U+2019>s No. 1 box office sometime during his administration. Any frayed relations with the country would ripple through Hollywood, which is already greenlighting movies based on their appeal among Chinese moviegoers. China<U+2019>s regulators enforce mandates on movie distribution and marketing that Hollywood hopes to change; negotiating any variation of the terms is already a fraught dance for studios. There is also a bigger bull<U+2019>s-eye on the host of investments coming from China to U.S. production companies hungry for financing. Some of those deals, including Dalian Wanda Group Co.<U+2019>s pending acquisition of Carmike Cinemas Inc., are already facing political pressure in Washington that could be amplified by Trump<U+2019>s presidency, given the candidate<U+2019>s anti-China rhetoric on the trail. Chinese businessmen like Alibaba<U+2019>s Jack Ma could pull back entertainment deals if they risk angering the party by doing business in the U.S. Legislators in Washington have already decried the <U+201C>soft power<U+201D> potential that China could wield by completing such deals. Hollywood will also be leaning on political power early next year, not long after Mr. Trump is inaugurated, to renegotiate China<U+2019>s quota on the number of foreign films it lets into its theaters. The last negotiation, which raised the number of releases to 34 from 20 , was led in 2012 by Vice President Joe Biden, in conversations with Xi Jinping, then China<U+2019>s vice president and now its president. President Xi has been consolidating power in recent months and could use Hollywood as a punching bag to prove his might and resist any expansion of the quota<U+2014>a move that could cost studios billions of dollars in revenue.

Trump was captured on camera making vulgar remarks during his 11 years as the show<U+2019>s host. On Monday, Mr. Burnett broke his silence and issued a statement with a basic message: Don<U+2019>t look at me. <U+201C>Despite reports to the contrary, Mark Burnett does not have the ability nor the right to release footage or other material from <U+2018>The Apprentice,<U+2019><U+201D> read a statement issued by Mr. Burnett<U+2019>s public relations team and attributed to Mr. Burnett and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the entertainment conglomerate that acquired a majority of his production company in 2014. The statement did not elaborate on the reasons Mr. Burnett could not distribute the video, beyond a general description of <U+201C>various contractual and legal requirements<U+201D> that <U+201C>restrict M.G.M.<U+2019>s ability to release such material.<U+201D> Left unanswered was the question that has consumed the news media and the political world in recent days: Do damning recordings exist of Mr. Trump from <U+201C>The Apprentice<U+201D> set? Interest in such material has intensified since Friday when a video emerged from another show, NBC<U+2019>s <U+201C>Access Hollywood,<U+201D> that showed Mr. Trump making lewd remarks about kissing and groping women. Some commentators have argued that Mr. Burnett has a civic obligation to release video that could affect voters<U+2019> opinions of Mr. Trump. In the television industry, the use of video created for a particular show is often governed by complex arrangements with producers, distributors and actors. Many employees in the reality TV industry also sign nondisclosure agreements, in part to prevent the release of spoilers. News reports over the weekend said that Mr. Burnett had informed <U+201C>Apprentice<U+201D> crew members that any leak of material could result in significant fines and perhaps a lawsuit. In the statement on Monday, Mr. Burnett and M.G.M. denied those claims, calling them <U+201C>completely and unequivocally false.<U+201D> The statement also noted that Mr. Burnett, whose other hit series include <U+201C>Survivor,<U+201D> <U+201C>Shark Tank<U+201D> and <U+201C>The Voice,<U+201D> had supported Democratic politicians in the past.",

        "original_post": "TOKYO<U+2014>Profits at Japan<U+2019>s top banks were hurt by negative interest rates and a stronger yen in the fiscal first half, highlighting challenges in the banking industry. Japan<U+2019>s biggest lender, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. or MUFG, reported net income of <U+00A5>490.5 billion ($4.5 billion) for the April-September period, down 18% from a year earlier as the Bank of Japan <U+2019>s negative interest rates policy started squeezing bank profits. Of that, <U+00A5>30.5 billion came from the bank<U+2019>s investment in Morgan Stanley, <U+00A5>31 billion from U.S. operations including Union Bank and <U+00A5>24 billion from Bank of Ayudhya in Thailand. The stronger yen was also a downside factor because it decreased the yen value of dollars earned overseas. MUFG, which gets about 40% of its profit from outside Japan, said a stronger yen generated a negative impact of <U+00A5>65 billion. The Bank of Japan early this year started charging interest instead of paying it on certain deposits held by commercial banks. This negative-rate policy brought down interest rates across the board, squeezing banks<U+2019> margins because they have to reduce rates charged to corporate borrowers but have a hard time lowering rates on depositors<U+2019> accounts below zero. Nobuyuki Hirano, MUFG<U+2019>s president, said at a news conference that ultralow interest rates also weighed on retail investors<U+2019> sentiment, leading to weak performance in sales of financial products. <U+201C>We<U+2019>ll likely continue to see negative interest rates as a downside factor in the second half,<U+201D> Mr. Hirano said. Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. also saw slight drops in net income<U+2014>6.7% and 7.5%, respectively. Mizuho<U+2019>s net income came to <U+00A5>358 billion for the April-September period, while SMFG posted <U+00A5>359 billion in net income. Top executives at the banks said they weren<U+2019>t sure yet how Donald Trump <U+2019>s presidential victory would affect their business. Shares of Japanese banks initially fell after Mr. Trump<U+2019>s win but then surged thanks to expectations for pro-growth policies and a lighter regulatory burden in the Trump administration. Mizuho<U+2019>s president, Yasuhiro Sato, said the surge in financial stocks might not last. <U+201C>If something goes in the wrong direction, the market could react negatively,<U+201D> he said. But he added that if loan demand increases in the new administration, that would be a big business opportunity for his bank. SMFG<U+2019>s president, Koichi Miyata, said the recent market volatility may create opportunities for trading but he wasn<U+2019>t sure how the election would change lending.

        "original_post": "Silicon Valley believes in the future. It invents it, it invests in it. Just not so much when the future is a few weeks away. As David Streitfeld writes , that is starting to change. Most of the world capital of technology has in the last few weeks started paying some lip service to the presidential election. Donations have been picking up, but, relative to the vast wealth in the Valley, remain modest. Much of what action there has been has favored Hillary Clinton <U+2014> or at least, been against Donald Trump . Not universally, however: As Mr. Streitfeld wrote, Peter Thiel, a co-founder of both PayPal and Palantir and early investor in Facebook, is giving Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign $1.25 million. Mr. Thiel, a gay, self-made billionaire immigrant libertarian, also spoke at the Republican convention in July. While much of this would seem at odds with Mr. Trump<U+2019>s usual supporters, Mr. Thiel has also said his secret to success is believing something very few people believe is true. In this case, he would be doubly at odds with the Valley, where some are backing Mrs. Clinton and most are markedly silent. It is notable that the vocal minority are, like Mr. Thiel, wealthy investors and venture capitalists. Tech corporations seem remarkably wary of offending somebody by having a political opinion, even compared with other American companies. Part of that may be a general alienation of tech from government. Tech ignores the reality that Silicon Valley was largely built on military contracts, and favors a future where government plays an ever-smaller role. The difficulty may be one of orientation. Tech is aimed largely at people and companies of means, who are interested in gaining more power and autonomy. Many of government<U+2019>s obligations are to the poor, the elderly and children. In other words, people with little power. President Obama, speaking Thursday at a White House Technology conference in Pittsburgh, identified the problem. One part of his speech, starting at the 1:09:20 mark in the video, is worth quoting at length. <U+201C>Government will never run the way Silicon Valley runs because, by definition, democracy is messy,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>Part of government<U+2019>s job, by the way, is dealing with problems that nobody else wants to deal with. <U+201C>So sometimes I talk to C.E.O.s, they come in and start telling me about leadership, and here<U+2019>s how we do things. And I say, well, if all I was doing was making a widget or producing an app, and I didn<U+2019>t have to worry about whether poor people could afford the widget, or I didn<U+2019>t have to worry about whether the app had some unintended consequences <U+2014> setting aside my Syria and Yemen portfolio <U+2014> then I think those suggestions are terrific.<U+201D> That<U+2019>s not the way people think about things in Silicon Valley, where an investment is supposed to remake the world, returning the money ten- or a hundredfold. It<U+2019>s not about maybe getting a few more votes, with an uncertain return.",

        "original_post": "WASHINGTON<U+2014>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau<U+00A0>on Friday<U+00A0>asked a federal appeals court to reconsider<U+00A0>a ruling that declared the agency<U+2019>s structure unconstitutional, expressing its resolve to fight the case that could undermine its authority. The federal watchdog agency asked<U+00A0>a<U+00A0>federal appeals court here to grant a review of the case by the entire court after a panel of three judges ruled in October that its single-director structure violated the separation of powers principle. The panel then ordered a new structure that gives the president the authority to dismiss the director at will. The judges<U+2019><U+00A0>rebuke of the five-year-old agency gained further importance after Republicans won the White House and control of both houses of Congress in the Nov. 8 elections. That threw into disarray the future of the agency, which was set up under the Obama administration and often criticized by Republican lawmakers as a symbol of government overreach. Legal experts say that if the October ruling stands, President-elect Donald Trump would dismiss CFPB Director Richard Cordray long before his term expires in 2018. The agency was widely expected to seek a new hearing from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The three judges on the panel that ruled against the CFPB were all Republican appointees, though they didn<U+2019>t all agree on the same reasoning in their decision. A majority of the judges on the appeals court are Democratic appointees who may be more sympathetic to the bureau. The case was filed by PHH Corp. , a New Jersey mortgage lender, which challenged Mr. Cordray<U+2019>s decision to impose a steep fine for allegedly accepting kickbacks from mortgage insurers. It could take the appeals court a month or longer to decide whether to grant a fresh review, legal experts say. The current structure of the bureau effectively remains in place while the litigation continues. If the appeals court reconsiders the case, that process could extend well into 2017, and potentially another year or more if the litigation lands at the Supreme Court. In Friday<U+2019>s petition, the CFPB argued that the panel<U+2019>s ruling purported to override Congress<U+2019>s explicit determination in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act to create an independent agency headed by a single person. The judges had also criticized the CFPB<U+2019>s enforcement action that led to the court ruling and how the bureau interpreted a decades-old law that had long governed industry practices. It ordered the agency to reconsider the penalties that the CFPB had imposed on PHH. The CFPB said the judges misinterpreted the industry law, in a manner that <U+201C>so fundamentally defeats the statutory purpose.<U+201D> Write to Yuka Hayashi at yuka.hayashi@wsj.com",

Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks denied Mr. Ryabkov<U+2019>s assertions. <U+201C>Absolutely not,<U+201D> she said when asked if his comments were accurate. Throughout the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump faced accusations from his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, of being cozy with the Kremlin. Mr. Trump has praised President Vladimir Putin, but has said he never met the Russian leader. U.S. intelligence agencies have blamed Russian-linked hackers for stealing tens of thousands of emails from Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign chairman that were then published in daily batches on the website WikiLeaks. Mr. Putin has denied Russian meddling in the U.S. elections, saying it wasn<U+2019>t in his country<U+2019>s interest to do so. Mr. Putin welcomed Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory, saying he hoped U.S.-Russian relations would warm and that the two countries would work together on global security and international issues. While some Russian officials have openly celebrated Mr. Trump<U+2019>s win, Mr. Ryabkov played down potential for an about-face in Russian-U.S. relations. <U+201C>We wouldn<U+2019>t like our public<U+2026> to have the impression that we are overwhelmed with rosy anticipations,<U+201D> he said. <U+2014>Michael C.

Trump deemed <U+201C>Saturday Night Live<U+201D> a <U+201C>hit job<U+201D> last week, the show wasted no time in skewering his latest debate performance against Hillary Clinton. The opening sketch again featured Alec Baldwin as Mr. Trump and Kate McKinnon as Mrs. Clinton, this time with Tom Hanks as the moderator Chris Wallace, and covered Mr. Trump<U+2019>s inconsistent foreign policy and inflammatory catchphrases. The sketch begins with Mr. Trump promising to be calm and collected before erupting into a brasher persona: calling the Mexican president <U+201C>Mr. Guacamole,<U+201D> blurting out <U+201C>bad hombre<U+201D> and <U+201C>nasty woman,<U+201D> and stumbling through an incoherent description of the situation in the Middle East. In the sketch, Mr. Trump refuses to accept the results of the election and accuses the media of rigging it, <U+201C>by taking all of the things I say and all of the things I do and putting them on TV.<U+201D> Mr. Baldwin also poked fun at his own brother Stephen, who is a Trump supporter . Ms. McKinnon, meanwhile, took a triumphant tone as Mrs. Clinton, wriggling out of a question involving WikiLeaks and gleefully reciting her r<U+00E9>sum<U+00E9> from the last 30 years. As she pivoted toward the electorate (<U+201C>Who do you trust to be your president: the Republican, or Donald Trump?<U+201D>), Mr. Trump pivoted toward the day after Election Day: <U+201C>On Nov. 9, make sure to check out Trump TV <U+2014> you<U+2019>re going to hate it.<U+201D> Later in the show, Mr. Hanks portrayed a Trump supporter who surprisingly finds common ground with attendees on <U+201C>Black Jeopardy,<U+201D> a recurring <U+201C>S.N.L.<U+201D> skit.",

        "original_post": "Democrats who cheered President Obama <U+2019>s use of executive authority to end run Congress should now hope the Supreme Court rules against his excesses. Without reinforced guardrails, here comes President-elect Donald Trump. On Monday the Justices heard oral argument in NLRB v. SW Genera l, challenging Mr. Obama<U+2019>s appointment of Lafe Solomon to serve as acting General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board. The Senate didn<U+2019>t act on his nomination, but Mr. Obama still left him in the job to favor labor unions. Under the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act (FVRA), the President can appoint acting officers to fill executive-branch vacancies while their Senate confirmations are pending under certain conditions and subject to time limits. The statute grants a limited waiver to the Senate<U+2019>s advice and consent power but preserves the Senate<U+2019>s role under the Constitution<U+2019>s Appointment<U+2019>s Clause. But Mr. Obama let Mr. Solomon serve in an acting capacity without Senate consent from June 2010 to November 2013. If the Court rules the appointment improper, the decisions Mr. Solomon made during that tenure will likely be invalidated, much like NLRB decisions were invalidated when a unanimous Court rejected President Obama<U+2019>s non-recess recess appointments in NLRB v. Noel Canning (2014). The Obama Administration argued that the practice should be allowed because Congress had not previously objected. Several Justices seemed skeptical. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s sort of an estoppel against Congress,<U+201D> Chief Justice John Roberts noted, <U+201C>if they don<U+2019>t speak up in every instance where they think some prerogative or interpretation is being misapplied<U+201D> and they are <U+201C>deemed to have acquiesced in it.<U+201D> He added that <U+201C>I think it<U+2019>s a very serious burden to impose on the legislative branch.<U+201D> <U+201C>What would be the consequences if we affirm?<U+201D> Justice Anthony Kennedy asked. <U+201C>Your brief didn<U+2019>t list a great parade of horribles. It seems to me that our system is quite capable of accommodating<U+201D> a ruling on behalf of SW General, the business that sued the NLRB. The decision will bear on Mr. Trump<U+2019>s authority to pick people to fill vacancies while waiting for Congress to act on nominations. Who likes checks and balances now?",

        "original_post": "Coal has been red hot this year. The energy commodity championed by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has been <U+201C>the spectacular turnaround story of 2016,<U+201D> said Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Price. Why? In April, China introduced new coal-production caps limiting the number of working days for its miners to 276 a year from 330 previously. Prices have since rocketed, with coal vastly outperforming other commodity markets. The value of coking coal shipped from Australia, the world<U+2019>s top exporter of the steelmaking commodity, has tripled to more than US$300 a metric ton. Thermal coal, used to generate electricity, has also jumped. China recently said it would loosen restrictions on coal-production, although that was skewed to thermal coal, designed to ensure enough supplies for winter heating. And <U+201C>there is clear skepticism from market participants that production is increasing [as] there is no data yet to illustrate it,<U+201D> Macquarie Group analysts wrote in a note. The country<U+2019>s coal output was down more than 10% on-year in the first nine months of 2016. In the U.S., Mr. Trump<U+2019>s surprise victory is fanning expectations of new investment in fossil fuels, with the next president having promised to revive the country<U+2019>s beleaguered coal regions. But measures to reverse recent industry regulation could increase both supply and demand for coal in the U.S., having a muted impact on the global market. <U+201C>For prices to normalize, the market has to see a Chinese supply response,<U+201D> the Macquarie analysts said. That<U+2019>s important because China is by far the world<U+2019>s biggest producer of the energy commodity, so even a small fall in its output is meaningful in the global market. As its production has fallen, China<U+2012>also the world<U+2019>s largest consumer of both thermal and coking coal<U+2012>has purchased more from the international market. The problem is that, after a steep, multi-year downturn in world coal markets, in which output was cut and new projects shelved, imports have struggled to fill the gap. <U+201C>Admittedly, Chinese imports fell back in September, but they remain high, and the most recent shipping data suggest that imports picked up again in October,<U+201D> Capital Economics economist Thomas Pugh said. Prices have meantime shown little sign of pulling back, with steady gains posted most days in recent times. The last time Australian coking coal prices recorded a daily fall in value was at the start of August. Chinese speculators have pounced on the market, racing in to bet on a continued rise in prices. Many analysts say this should be the peak in prices. They argue high prices will ultimately trigger a rise in supplies. Macquarie forecasts coking coal to average US$200 a ton this quarter, before falling back to an average of US$150 a ton next year and US$120 the following year. It projects thermal coal will also fall following an estimated average of roughly US$83 a ton this quarter. Write to Rhiannon Hoyle at rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com",

Our corporate tax code <U+2014> the subject of my column this morning <U+2014> is a mess. It has the highest official rate of any advanced economy, which forces companies to devote time and effort to avoid paying that official rate. And it has so many loopholes that many companies end up paying relatively little, creating unfairness across industries and depriving Washington of important revenue. Without that revenue, the government has to collect more in taxes from middle-class and low-income households. So what can be done? The good news is that an overhaul of corporate tax code may be one of the first items that Congress takes up if Hillary Clinton is elected president. There are a few different options: The first, and seemingly most likely, would be the classic approach to tax reform: lowering the rate and broadening the base. This approach would reduce the official 35 percent rate, while also eliminating loopholes. Edward Kleinbard, a tax expert at the University of Southern California, has laid out such an approach , as have the bipartisan duo of Senator Ron Wyden and Senator Dan Coats. (Wyden would be in line to chair the Senate Finance Committee if Democrats win Senate control.) The second is an approach that the Center for American Progress, a think tank with close ties to Clinton, has promoted. The center has published a more radical plan from Alan Auerbach, one of the most oft-cited tax economists. He advocates giving up on trying to tax the overseas profits of American companies <U+2014> which he considers a fool<U+2019>s game <U+2014> and instead more aggressively taxing the profits they earn here. Notably, the leading proposal by House Republicans takes a related approach. The most radical approach is to reduce corporate taxes sharply and instead tax individuals<U+2019> investment income much more heavily. As with the first two options, this one has support across ideological lines, having been proposed by Eric Toder of the Urban Institute and Alan Viard of the American Enterprise Institute. All of these plans have benefits and drawbacks <U+2014> and any of them would be better than the status quo. You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook .

        "original_post": "Colin L. Powell, the Republican former secretary of state, said on Tuesday that he planned to vote for Hillary Clinton for president as he condemned her rival, Donald J. Trump, at an event on Long Island. Speaking before the Long Island Association, a trade group that frequently hosts political figures, Mr. Powell divulged his intentions come Election Day. <U+201C>I am voting for Hillary Clinton,<U+201D> he said, according to Matthew Cohen, a spokesman for the association. Mr. Powell went on to praise Mrs. Clinton for her skills as a leader and her experience. Paule Pachter, a Long Island Association board member, said that Mr. Powell was blunt. <U+201C>He said he would support Hillary Clinton and he also elaborated on several reason why he felt that Donald Trump was not the right candidate,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>He spoke about his inexperience, he spoke about the messages that he<U+2019>s sending out every day to his supporters, which really paints our country in a negative light across the globe with all our allies.<U+201D> The comments were a change from Mr. Powell<U+2019>s tone in hacked emails from his inbox that were made public in September. In the emails, Mr. Powell criticized Mr. Trump but also expressed bitterness at Mrs. Clinton for repeatedly pointing to Mr. Powell<U+2019>s email habits to explain away her own use of a private email server while she ran the State Department. Mr. Powell<U+2019>s comments make him the latest member of the Republican foreign policy and national security establishment to openly condemn his party<U+2019>s nominee, and to say that Mrs. Clinton is the preferred choice. But Mrs. Clinton came under harsh attack on Tuesday from Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, who echoed in more pointed language Mr. Trump<U+2019>s recent assertions that Mrs. Clinton should be jailed. <U+201C>When I see her, I see her in an orange jumpsuit,<U+201D> Mr. Giuliani, a former United States attorney, said on a Philadelphia talk radio station, WPHT. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m sorry, or at least a striped one.

        "original_post": "If a Trump presidency means higher bond yields and less regulation, it would be easy to think that is good news for insurers. Like many things with insurance, however, the simple answer isn<U+2019>t often right. On regulation, the biggest win could go to the very biggest U.S. insurers<U+2014> AIG , Prudential Financial and MetLife <U+2014>which may no longer be tagged as systemically important . That could cut regulatory costs. A Republican-leaning Financial Stability Oversight Council could easily decide that insurers shouldn<U+2019>t be caught by provisions meant for banks, according to some analysts. More relief could come from scrapping the Labor Department<U+2019>s fiduciary rule, which affects the sale of retirement products and is due to come into force in April. Plenty of Republicans don<U+2019>t like it , but there will be little time to introduce new legislation to repeal it unless it rises near the top of their agenda. Then there is the question of rising yields. This is only good if they rise in the right way and for the right reasons. Insurers will do best if yields rise steadily and if they are increasing due to good, well-balanced economic growth. The upsetting factor is if yields rise mainly due to higher inflation: that would drive up the costs of future claims even as higher interest rates reduce the present value of those liabilities. Also if yields rise too quickly, that would make products with income guarantees, like various annuity products in the U.S. and Europe, seem much less attractive. Savers are more likely to stop paying into these products or cash them in, which would hit insurers<U+2019> expected future profits and force them to write down the investment they made to attract these customers, known as deferred acquisition costs. But even if yields rise in a nice steady way, the trouble for insurers is that it can take years to see the benefits. They hold lots of bond investments to maturity, so the ongoing average yield of their portfolio can be quite different to the yield they can get on new investments. That characteristic has protected insurers on the way down: portfolio yields today are still much higher than yields available on new bonds. But it also means that average portfolio yields are likely to continue to decline for some time before they turn round again. MetLife said last week that the yields on its maturing bonds was between 1.5% and 2% higher than on those it was buying today. In Europe, Moody<U+2019>s estimates that this effect will shrink the industry<U+2019>s investment income by 3% to 7% each year for the next five years if rates stay where they are and companies don<U+2019>t invest in riskier assets. Insurance stocks have struggled this year as the erosion of investment income has led to concerns about the sustainability of dividends, but have bounced sharply after the election. Rising bond yields at least means income problems won<U+2019>t keep getting worse<U+2014>however, that is a long way from saying things will definitely get better. Write to Paul J. Davies at paul.davies@wsj.com",

The Republican presidential nominee was declared the winner over Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton with 51.2% of the votes, when the Associated Press called the race with 93% of precincts reporting. The GOP stronghold emerged this year as one of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s top opportunities to take a state won by Republican Mitt Romney in 2012. Polls have shown Mrs. Clinton holding a slight but steady lead, powered by the state<U+2019>s quickly diversifying demographics, including more minority and young voters who have relocated there. Mrs. Clinton held a 6-point lead in late October , according to a Wall Street Journal\/NBC News\/Marist survey. While Mrs. Clinton built up a sophisticated ground operation, with fleets of staffers and volunteers registering, persuading and turning out voters, Mr. Trump relied mainly upon the Republican National Committee<U+2019>s infrastructure to get out the vote. Mr. Trump also won despite being outspent by Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign on the airwaves nearly every week leading up to the election. Both candidates recognized the significance of a victory in the Tar Heel state. Mr. Trump and his running mate, Wisconsin Gov. Mike Pence, held frequent rallies, and Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s operation flooded the state with popular surrogates, including first lady Michelle Obama and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.). Republican Mitt Romney won the state 50% to 48% in 2012.",

Donald Trump needs to pivot fast on his core economic program and embrace cutting payroll taxes for the working class, not income taxes for the elites. That means jettisoning the campaign's $3.3 trillion individual income tax cut (10-years), which reflects warmed over GOP dogma about a Laffer Curve that has gone missing. He should replace it with a far bolder idea that is right for the present times and is based on far more compelling economics and super-smart politics.",

Startup Chorus aims to arm salespeople with AI, promising sales pitch refinements. San Francisco- and Tel Aviv-based Chorus has raised $6.3 million in seed financing led by Emergence Capital Partners. Chorus isn<U+2019>t alone. A crowded arena of startups want to improve sales, such as InsideSales and ClearSlide. But Chorus analyzes the actual sales conversations to understand the elements of winning deals. Cloud computing has helped upend traditional enterprise software markets, but artificial intelligence offers a next wave of industry change. <U+201C>How machine learning and AI will interact with enterprise software will be as fundamental a sea change as the move from client-server to the cloud was,<U+201D> said Gordon Ritter, a co-founder and general partner at Emergence Capital. Mr. Ritter invested early in Salesforce.com . Chorus, which integrates with Salesforce.com and webconferencing tools, records sales calls and then uses speech recognition and natural language processing to extract information from the voice data. The software identifies topics, even if they were not mentioned. For example, mentions of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump would be highlighted as <U+201C>politics.<U+201D> Chorus<U+2019>s dashboard shows whether planned topics were covered in the conversation or not, such as <U+201C>budget,<U+201D> or <U+201C>follow up.<U+201D> It also shows via a color-coded chart who was speaking when, to identify, for example, if a sales person was speaking too much. Salespeople can also identify when a competitor<U+2019>s name came up, and what was said to win that deal versus what was said to lose the deal. Looking at this aggregated data, sales reps and managers can see what techniques, topics or approaches work best for winning deals. This granular data is typically not captured without voice data, since only about 5% of a conversation is written into notes by salespeople, said Roy Raanani, Chorus chief executive and co-founder. The technology can identify such things as: <U+201C>high engagement<U+201D> with a prospect, an unprofessional speaking manner, hesitations in speech, or speech that is too slow or too fast. It can also identify voice pitch, and how much pitch harmony there is between a salesperson and prospect. For example, a quick change in pitch can indicate engagement, said Chorus co-founder Micha Breakstone. The software does not currently make recommendations on this type of data but could in the future. Chorus customers include Cisco<U+2019>s Meraki, Marketo, Qualtrics and Talkable. <U+201C>Chorus helps us understand, dissect and ultimately distribute best practices to get new sales representatives up to speed faster while improving existing sales representatives<U+2019> win rates,<U+201D> said Charlie Besecker, head of global enablement at Qualtrics, in an email.

Bernie Sanders, who during the Democratic primaries had demanded Hillary Clinton release transcripts of her speeches to Wall Street firms, expressed no such concern after the publication of what appeared to be hacked excerpts from those speeches . The excerpts offer evidence for many of the charges he leveled during their contentious contest, bu t Mr. Sanders is supporting Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign and on Saturday passed up the chance to criticize her. The organization that publishes secret information, WikiLeaks, on Friday released what it said was email correspondence of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, including what appeared to be excerpts from the Democratic presidential candidate<U+2019>s Wall Street speeches in recent years, which she had refused to release. The Clinton campaign declined to verify their authenticity. All the speeches were from before Mrs. Clinton launched her current presidential campaign. In the excerpts, Mrs. Clinton appears to be talking in private in a tone more favorable to free trade and to banks than she took on the campaign trail. For instance, the excerpts show that in a 2013 speech, she says, <U+201C>My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders.<U+201D> She also apparently praises Wall Street bankers and a budget proposal that included cuts to Social Security benefits. Mr. Sanders campaigned hard against Mrs. Clinton, saying she had supported damaging free trade agreements and was too close to Wall Street. He also questioned her commitment to protecting Social Security. After he lost the nomination, though, Mrs. Clinton made some policy concessions to him and he endorsed her candidacy. On Saturday, he focused on their shared policy agenda. <U+201C>Whatever Secretary Clinton may or may not have said behind closed doors on Wall Street, I am determined to implement the agenda of the Democratic Party platform which was agreed to by her campaign,<U+201D> he said. He cited the platform<U+2019>s call to break up large financial institutions and prosecuting Wall Street executives who <U+201C>engaged in illegal behavior.<U+201D> Mr. Sanders also said he would continue fighting the pending Trans Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement Mrs. Clinton praised as it was being developed when she was secretary of state, but ultimately came out against. She has said she won<U+2019>t change her mind about the trade pact if she is elected, amid concern from some trade opponents that she would reverse course again.

The problem, which reportedly affects iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s devices, is the latest challenge for Apple in China, where sales have slowed and it has brushed up against a more assertive government. The announcement also comes amid growing concerns about U.S.-China relations after the election of Donald Trump, who has described China as a currency manipulator. The China Consumers Association, which is state-approved but isn<U+2019>t an official regulator, said users have reported their iPhones shutting down automatically despite having more than 50% of battery power left. The phones can<U+2019>t be turned on again until they are plugged in<U+2014>even after a system upgrade, the association said. The consumer group said it has approached Apple about the issue and would continue to monitor it. An Apple spokeswoman had no immediate comment. Apple has invested heavily in China in recent years. Chief Executive Tim Cook has traveled more to China than any other country over the past three years and said that China will eventually surpass the U.S. as Apple<U+2019>s largest market. But Apple sales , after rocketing higher, are falling in China as the company faces more competition from homegrown rivals . Revenue in Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, fell 17% in the fiscal year ended Sept. 24, after growing 84% in the prior year. The consumer investigation follows two Apple brushes with Chinese regulators earlier this year. In June , Beijing<U+2019>s municipal intellectual-property bureau awarded an injunction against sales of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices in a patent case. The injunction hasn<U+2019>t been implemented because Apple has appealed. In April, the national government shut down Apple<U+2019>s online book and movie services because they violated local media guidelines. The complaint by the consumer group evokes memories of incidents in 2013 and 2014, when Apple was accused by state-run China Central Television of skirting warranties on iPhones and tracking user locations. China sometimes uses state-run media and semiofficial sites to signal permissible, and impermissible, behavior to foreign companies. At the same time, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s criticism of China as a currency manipulator has stoked fears of a trade war and backlash against U.S. companies like Apple that depend on China for a sizable portion of total sales. <U+2014>Eva Dou contributed to this article.

        "original_post": "Cheap mortgages were never going to last forever, but few expected this. A spike in Treasury yields since last week<U+2019>s election has had a rapid impact on home lending rates. The average 30-year fixed-mortgage rate was 4.02%<U+00A0>on<U+00A0>Tuesday, up nearly half a percentage point since the election, according to Mortgage News Daily . That marks the fastest gain in a three-day period since the so-called taper tantrum in May and June 2013, when rates spiked and home sales slumped after the Federal Reserve signaled intentions to start scaling back its stimulus programs. Concern is rising in the wake of the presidential election that higher rates will crimp the housing market. The weekly mortgage application survey by the Mortgage Bankers Association due<U+00A0>Wednesday might give observers a false sense of comfort. Capturing the results for the week ending Nov. 11, MBA<U+2019>s release will be its first since Donald Trump <U+2019>s election victory. But back in May 2013 the first week affected by higher rates showed a spike in activity, perhaps as homeowners rushed to lock in low rates. A sickening 60% slide in the index, which measures the level of purchase and refinancing mortgage application activity, followed through that September. Recent trends in housing are noteworthy. The refinance index last week fell to a six-month low, though refinancing as a percentage of mortgage activity still accounted for some 62% of applications. This was above 70% before the 2013 taper tantrum before sliding to 57% later that year. Refinancing is more rate-sensitive than purchase activity. Those in the market for a home are far less likely to change their plans. But the latest rate spike creates a quandary for many potential home buyers: Act now while mortgage rates are still historically low or wait for them to potentially resume sliding.<U+00A0>Modest changes in rates have a large impact on affordability. If, for instance, 30-year mortgage rates rise by 1 percentage point a year from now and home prices rise by another 5%, a monthly mortgage payment could jump by around 17%. A benign result<U+00A0>Wednesday, or even a poor one, won<U+2019>t mean much. Watch this space closely, though. Mr. Trump <U+2019>s surprise victory threatens to crash the house party.

        "original_post": "Minutes from the Federal Reserve<U+2019>s September meeting released Wednesday made it clear the central bank aims to raise overnight rates soon. Three committee members wanted to raise them right away, while others said the decision was <U+201C>a close call.<U+201D> Their decision was largely based on the economy<U+2014>whether strong job growth had tightened the labor market to the point it would push inflation above Fed<U+2019>s 2% goal. Two other factors will likely determine whether the central bank raises rates, one that was discussed in the minutes and one that wasn<U+2019>t. The first was whether the market was prepared for a rate increase, the second was the presidential election. Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal<U+2019>s Heard on the Street team. Subscribe to the podcast. The Fed staff, in its review of the financial situation, pointed out that investors didn<U+2019>t expect the bank to raise rates in September. They noted in the minutes that market-based probabilities put the odds of a September rate increase at about 15%. Such a specific discussion of the odds hasn<U+2019>t always appeared in Fed minutes. The situation is different now: Futures markets put the chances of a rate increase by the end of the year at about 65%, according the CME Group . The move would likely come at the Fed<U+2019>s December meeting, since its early November meeting comes the week before Election Day. But the election itself may represent the biggest risk to the Fed<U+2019>s hope of raising rates. The Fed steered clear of the political lightning rod, but the presidential election looms large over its rate decisions. Fed officials don<U+2019>t want to raise rates during a period of market turmoil. A victory by Donald Trump would likely be more unsettling for markets than if Hillary Clinton wins, given the uncertainty about what Mr. Trump might do in office. Even some members of his economic team openly disagree with him on the economy . If bond and foreign-exchange markets in particular are roiled by a Trump victory , that would raise the odds of the Fed staying on hold. Conversely, a victory by Mrs. Clinton, who is widely seen as a status quo candidate, might relieve markets, though some stock-market sectors could get hit. If markets stay calm enough, investors would likely be facing higher rates. That would add a bit of spice to the political transition.",

        "original_post": "LONDON<U+2014> AstraZeneca PLC<U+2019>s net profit climbed in the third quarter as a one-off tax windfall helped offset sharply lower sales of the company<U+2019>s best-selling cholesterol pill, after several cheap generic versions launched earlier this year. The drug giant posted net profit of $1 billion for the three months to Sept. 30, 32% higher than in the same period a year earlier, while revenue dipped 4% to $5.7 billion. Analysts had expected net income of $731 million and revenue of $5.87 billion. Cambridge, England-based Astra said profit was lifted by a $453 million payment relating to agreements between the Canadian tax authority and those of the U.K. and Sweden. Core operating profit, a measure that strips out certain one-time gains and losses, declined 2% to $1.7 billion. Stripping out currency effects, net profit increased 4%, revenue fell 4% and core operating profit declined 13%. Astra is leaning on a string of new drugs such as blood-thinner Brilinta and cancer drug Tagrisso to return the company to sustainable growth after years of flat or falling revenue, as old best-sellers lose out to cheaper copycats after losing patent protection. Those new products did drive revenue growth, but not enough to offset the sharp decline in sales of old blockbusters such as Crestor<U+2014>which lost patent protection earlier this year<U+2014>and heartburn medicine Nexium. Crestor sales slumped 44% to $688 million in the third quarter, while Nexium revenue declined 20% to $516 million. Chief Executive Pascal Soriot has said the company<U+2019>s recently-launched medicines, plus several still in clinical testing will increase revenue to $45 billion by 2023 compared with $25 billion in 2015. That promise was a key part of his defense against an unsolicited, and ultimately failed, takeover bid by Pfizer in 2014. Mr. Soriot said that strong growth trajectory should start in the second half of next year. At the same time, drug company revenues are under pressure from increasingly cost-conscious governments and health insurers, especially in the lucrative U.S. market. Mr. Soriot said the election of Donald Trump in Tuesday<U+2019>s election wouldn<U+2019>t alleviate that pressure. He also said it was too early to predict how a repeal or substantial modification of the Affordable Care Act<U+2014>one of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign promises<U+2014>would affect the industry. <U+201C>The U.S. marketplace has always been [one] that supports innovation and new differentiated medicines,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>We hope it will remain the same.<U+201D> Astra<U+2019>s revenue was also boosted by $674 million in so-called externalization revenue, or the proceeds from the sale of rights to drugs that fall outside its core therapy areas of cancer, respiratory and cardiovascular disease. The company backed earlier guidance to say it expects a low-to-mid-single-digit decline for both revenue and core earnings per share. Write to Denise Roland at Denise.Roland@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Hurricane Matthew has led Democrats to push for Florida to extend its voter registration deadline of Tuesday, as the party fears that its get-out-the-vote effort will be derailed in the waning days of the drive because of mass evacuations and other aftereffects of the storm. Gov. Rick Scott , a Republican, declined on Thursday to extend the deadline after a call from Hillary Clinton <U+2019>s presidential campaign to accommodate people disrupted by the storm. <U+201C>Everybody has had a lot of time to register,<U+201D> Mr. Scott told reporters in Tallahassee. With the registration deadline on Tuesday, the storm caused Democratic-leaning groups to put off plans for registration drives, which typically draw a surge of new voters in the final days before registration ends. About 50,000 people registered in the last five days before the cutoff in 2012, according to Daniel A. Smith , an elections expert at the University of Florida. Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign manager, Robby Mook, asked for more time to sign up new voters in Florida, the most contested of all battleground states. <U+201C>Our hope would be that a little bit more time will be given for people who were expecting to be able to get registered before the election,<U+201D> Mr. Mook said on Thursday. <U+201C>We certainly expect that the governor and local officials will make that possible.<U+201D> Both Republicans and Democrats in Florida, a state that President Obama won by a mere 74,000 votes in 2012, have aggressively sought to add more of their supporters to the rolls this year. Republican registration has increased by 265,501 through August, and Democrats added 213,094, according to the state Division of Elections . Democrats accused Mr. Scott, who helps run a <U+201C>super PAC<U+201D> that supports Donald J. Trump , of playing politics with his decision not to extend the registration deadline. But a spokeswoman for the governor, Jackie Schutz, fired back in The Miami Herald, <U+201C>For any political party to ask this in the middle of a storm is political.<U+201D> Meanwhile, Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina, a Republican, extended voter registration in her state, also in the path of Hurricane Matthew, beyond the original Saturday deadline. Heavily populated South Florida avoided a direct hit by the storm, although more than 500,000 people in the state were without power, the governor said in a news conference.

So somebody comes after him and says that he<U+2019>s done something nefarious and horrible, and he just goes back at them with all guns blazing <U+2014> you know, boom, boom, boom. And admits nothing, never admit anything, never say you made a mistake, just keep coming. And if you lose, declare victory. And that<U+2019>s exactly what happened there. He lost as clearly as you could lose but he loudly proclaimed his victory.<U+201D> This quotation comes from Tony Schwartz, the ghostwriter of Donald Trump<U+2019>s book, <U+201C>The Art of the Deal.<U+201D> Schwartz is talking about Trump<U+2019>s response to a 1970s lawsuit against his company for refusing to rent apartments to African-Americans. But of course the description also applies to so much else <U+2014> including Trump<U+2019>s support for the Iraq War , his <U+201C> birther <U+201D> conspiracy theory, his refusal to release tax returns and, most recently, his history of sexual assault. Over the past week, multiple women have come forward with stories of Trump<U+2019>s kissing, touching and grabbing them against their will. Trump has responded by calling them liars and insulting them (even though he had previously bragged about precisely the behavior the women describe).

Marc Fisher, another writer, similarly described a lesson that Trump had learned from a mentor: <U+201C>You need to fight back harder than they ever hit you.<U+201D> Keep in mind that all of the Frontline interviews took place before Trump<U+2019>s sexual accusers came forward <U+2014> and yet the descriptions capture Trump<U+2019>s response to a T.

        "original_post": "Right-wing Israeli politicians see Donald Trump<U+2019>s election as helpful toward their goal of burying the prospect of a Palestinian state. On Wednesday, Israeli lawmakers gave preliminary approval to a bill that would retroactively legalize settlements built on private Palestinian land in the West Bank . The bill is intended to prevent the court-ordered demolition of an illegal outpost by Dec. 25. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposes the bill and Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit has said it violates international law . Still, the fact that it cleared a major hurdle represents an alarming gain for pro-settlement Israelis. Education Minister Naftali Bennett, who heads the Jewish Home party, the most ardent supporter of settlements, proclaimed that <U+201C>the era of the Palestinian state is over.<U+201D> This is at odds with the Israeli government<U+2019>s official position, which holds out hope for a two-state solution <U+2014> an outcome Washington has sought to broker for decades. On Wednesday, Israel <U+2019>s defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, said that the government should strike a deal with the Trump administration to authorize expanded construction in the major West Bank settlements. Any move in that direction would be misguided and dangerous for the United States. <U+201C>One of the most effective ways that ISIS and other terrorist groups have attracted recruits is by tarring the United States with Israel<U+2019>s expanding occupation of the West Bank,<U+201D> Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont said in a statement. <U+201C>This legislation to retroactively legalize illegal settlements will be welcomed by those murderous groups as further evidence that America<U+2019>s closest ally in the region is bent on destroying a peaceful solution, including the possibility of a Palestinian state.<U+201D> Pro-settlement Israelis were particularly heartened by an interview Jason Greenblatt, a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Trump, gave to Israel<U+2019>s Army Radio after the election, in which he said Mr. Trump did not view the settlements as <U+201C>an obstacle for peace.<U+201D> Mr. Trump<U+2019>s personal views on the settlements are unclear. He recently told The Wall Street Journal that he aspired to broker the <U+201C>ultimate deal,<U+201D> to bring an end to the conflict between Israel and Palestinians, <U+201C>for humanity<U+2019>s sake.<U+201D> If that is indeed his aspiration, he should immediately signal to the Israelis <U+2014> not to mention his advisers <U+2014> that he will need time and consultation to develop a coherent policy on the region. Absent such a signal, the right wing in Israel will be further encouraged to forge ahead with a new and dangerous expansion of settlements.

        "original_post": "The holiday shopping season is the most important time of year for retailers. It is also one of the most underwhelming for their stock prices. Retail stocks have been among the biggest winners in the postelection rally. Macy<U+2019>s Inc. has jumped 20%, Nordstrom Inc. is up 13% and J.C. Penney Co. has surged 19%, to name a few. Overall, the S&P Retail Select Industry Index has risen about 5% since Donald Trump <U+2019>s election victory, outpacing the S&P 500. Retail<U+2019>s good times likely have a short shelf life. Historically, the performance of retail stocks has been less than stellar at a time when their businesses have been most in focus. Since 2000, the S&P 500 retail sector has underperformed the broad market from Thanksgiving through year-end in 11 of 16 years, according to research firm Bespoke Investment Group. Retail stocks have posted a median gain of 0.7% over that time, half the S&P 500<U+2019>s median gain. Expectations are high for this holiday season. The National Retail Federation forecasts total holiday sales excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales will increase 3.6%, to $655.8 billion. That is well above the 2.5% average gain over the past decade. That comes even as Black<U+00A0>Friday<U+00A0>has declined in importance over the years thanks to the proliferation of online shopping and discounts stretching over longer periods. Even so, forecasting holiday season patterns is never easy. Holiday spending last year missed the federation<U+2019>s 3.7% forecast, instead coming in at 3%. Sure enough, retail stocks underperformed the S&P 500 last year in the holiday season through Christmas. That pattern might also explain why short sellers, who bet on stock declines, are pouncing once again ahead of the holidays.<U+00A0>About 5.3% of available shares of U.S. retailers were on loan to short sellers, according to financial-data provider IHS Markit Ltd. That gauge of short-selling activity hovers near its highest level over the past two years. <U+201C>Faith in the rally is tenuous,<U+201D> said Simon Colvin, an analyst at IHS Markit. Short sellers are focused on retailers such as Williams-Sonoma Inc., Finish Line Inc. and Nordstrom, with the amount of shares sold short in those stocks recently surging to double-digit percentages. By comparison, IHS Markit<U+2019>s short-interest proxy for the overall S&P 500 is 2.8%. In the Black<U+00A0>Friday<U+00A0>shopping rush, leave retail stocks on the shelves.

Prospects for trade and globalization plus higher U.S. interest rates are reasons for concern. But Russia looks like an exception<U+2014>in part because of its already-isolated status. Russia financial markets bucked the trend Wednesday . While the MSCI Emerging Markets stock index fell 2.5%, the MSCI Russia gained 1.9%. The ruble rose against the dollar, even as currencies like the Mexican peso, South African rand and Turkish lira took a pasting. The bull case rests on hopes for the easing of sanctions , based on Mr. Trump<U+2019>s apparent desire for a closer relationship with Russia . But even without that, Russia may be okay if U.S. policies lean toward protectionism<U+2014>it isn<U+2019>t reliant on constant flows of capital in financial markets. It runs a current account surplus and its government debt level is low. The outlook for the Russian economy is improving as the hit from lower oil prices fades. The International Monetary Fund forecasts a return to growth next year, albeit at a 1% pace. Overreliance on commodities, poor demographics and weak investment continue to be problems. Russian President Vladimir Putin <U+2019>s unpredictable nature and tensions over Syria and Ukraine aren<U+2019>t going away, even if Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election looks like good news for him . In the near term, oil may still be the swing factor for Russian markets. Falling prices would be a setback, albeit a familiar one, but some see Mr. Trump<U+2019>s inflationary policies as positive for commodities in general. The key factor that makes Russia different is that it has already suffered a deterioration in its international relations. U.S. protectionism won<U+2019>t make Russia<U+2019>s position worse. But a friendlier Washington could give Russia a boost. Other emerging countries may face new threats to their economic models. Even if detente proves a stretch, Russia<U+2019>s exposure to shocks looks more limited. Write to Richard Barley at richard.barley@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Evidence emerges that the President<U+2019>s consigliere solicited corporate donations to nonprofit foundations in return for influence and used access to sensitive government information to help make policy. Prosecutors raid government and foundation offices looking for evidence of corruption. This is not a prediction for the first 100 days of a Hillary Clinton administration. It<U+2019>s a scandal that has seen South Korean President Park Geun-hye<U+2019>s approval rating fall to 14%. Ms. Park campaigned in 2012 as a reformer of Korea<U+2019>s corporate-political power nexus. Yet once in office she failed to contain the power of the chaebol , the family-run conglomerates that dominate the economy, and she resurrected practices from the 1970s when her father, Park Chung-hee, was dictator. These included using the National Security Law to disband an opposition party and prosecuting critics for criminal defamation. At the center of the current scandal is Choi Soon-sil, the leader of the Church of Eternal Life and a confidante of the President for four decades. Last year she set up the Mir and K-Sports Foundations to promote Korean culture overseas. Within months they raised $72 million from corporate donors, allegedly with the help of the Culture Ministry and the Federation of Korean Industries. Critics say that the foundations were intended to fund Ms. Park<U+2019>s retirement activities. Investigators are probing whether Ms. Choi used some of the funds to buy homes in Germany. Both women deny the accusations. Journalists have found advance copies of the President<U+2019>s speeches on a computer once owned by Ms. Choi, as well as footage of her giving orders to presidential staff. This confirms public suspicions that she wields political power behind the scenes. Simmering anger over chaebol abuses explains the public<U+2019>s furious reaction to the scandal over the past month. Ms. Park criticized her predecessors for pardoning chaebol owners, but then she pardoned the chairman of the SK Group last year. Regulators also allowed Samsung to push through a merger consolidating the power of the founder<U+2019>s grandson Lee Jae-yong that hurt minority shareholders. Ms. Park<U+2019>s public apology and the resignation of her aides has failed to appease public anger. With 15 months left in her term, she has little to no support in the National Assembly. South Korea needs strong leadership to reform its economy and maintain its competitiveness. It also must reckon with North Korea<U+2019>s accelerating drive to put nuclear warheads on missiles capable of reaching the South, Japan and the U.S. Koreans elected Ms. Park in part out of nostalgia for the high-growth years of the 1960s and 1970s, but she failed to make a clean break from the darker aspects of her father<U+2019>s rule. The country will now have to pay a price for this ethically challenged inheritance.",

        "original_post": "For several years a group of conservative media types has lectured Republicans that the key to their political salvation is to expand the child tax credit. Well, they<U+2019>ve now found their candidate<U+2014> Hillary Clinton, and therein lies a political lesson. This week Mrs. Clinton proposed to double the current $1,000 per child tax credit to $2,000 up to age 4. She<U+2019>d also expand eligibility to people who aren<U+2019>t working or earning very little. Oh, and in a press release, the Clinton campaign threatened that the new proposal is <U+201C>only a down payment<U+201D> on other family-friendly tax ideas<U+2014>or not so family friendly. Mrs. Clinton is promising <U+201C>tax relief<U+201D> for <U+201C>those without children, and with older children.<U+201D> If it takes a village to raise a child, she now wants to subsidize the entire village. The child tax credit, which was created in 1997, is a tutorial in how social spending through the tax code becomes its own political engine. It was originally a $500 deduction. The George W. Bush tax bill of 2001 converted it to a partially refundable credit of $1,000, on the notion that low-income Americans don<U+2019>t owe enough income taxes for a deduction to be valuable. The tax freebie does nothing to increase economic growth and it costs a bundle in lost revenue. Mrs. Clinton began her campaign with a promise to increase the credit<U+2014>details to come, as they did Tuesday<U+2014>and also boost the separate credit for child-care expenses and mandate <U+201C>free<U+201D> maternity leave. Donald Trump answered with his own expanded child subsidy in September<U+2014>a deduction that would allow parents to write off the average state cost of child care for up to four kids while applying the earned-income tax credit to deliver more benefits to low-income non-taxpaying families. The political lesson is that once Republicans cede the liberal premise that the tax code is the appropriate venue for social engineering, liberals will always come through with a higher transfer payment and a chicken-in-every-tax-pot pitch. Marco Rubio proposed lifting the child tax credit to $2,500, not that it did him much political good. But if Mr. Rubio were the GOP nominee, a lot would be different in this race. For example, Mrs. Clinton would probably have proposed tripling the credit to $3,000.",

        "original_post": "House Republicans sent a letter on Tuesday to every government agency asking them to halt all rulemaking until President-elect Donald Trump takes office. The letter, sent by the House Republican committee chairmen and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, warns federal agencies against finalizing pending rules that may have <U+201C>unintended consequences<U+201D> for consumers and businesses. At a press conference<U+00A0>on Tuesday, Mr. McCarthy said that, following Barack Obama <U+2019>s election in 2008, House Democrats, led by then-congressman and eventual White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, had made a similar request. He also noted that the Congressional Review Act allows Congress to <U+201C>come back and vote<U+2026>out<U+201D> any <U+201C>midnight<U+00A0>regulation<U+201D> federal agencies try to finalize in the administration<U+2019>s final weeks. The House also will vote later this week on a bill to prevent<U+00A0>last-minute<U+00A0>regulations, though the White House has promised to veto that bill. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest stressed last week that the administration intended to continue exercising its authority until it is officially out of office. <U+201C>President Obama will be President of the United States through January 20th and he will exercise all of the authorities of that office until then,<U+201D> he said. Besides sending the letter, some committee chairmen took their plea directly to agency heads. In a hearing with Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo White, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) urged her to not complete additional rules, including any unfinished rules mandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law, before Mr. Trump takes office in January. The comments came a day after Ms. White announced her plans to leave the agency at the end of the Obama administration. <U+201C>I do intend to carry out the agenda I outlined<U+2026> as much as I can,<U+201D> Ms. White testified. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump repeatedly vowed to roll back the Obama administration<U+2019>s regulatory agenda, promising to cut up to 70% of all federal regulations. <U+2014>Andrew Ackerman and Kristina Peterson contributed to this article.

        "original_post": "WASHINGTON<U+2014>A federal judge issued a nationwide injunction blocking a sweeping regulation set to qualify millions more Americans for overtime pay Dec. 1, delivering a blow to one of President Barack Obama <U+2019>s signature workplace rules. The Labor Department completed the rule in May as part of the Obama administration<U+2019>s goal to restore and expand the middle class -- either by raising incomes for workers in industries such as retail, food service and beyond or by giving them back personal time they<U+2019>ve forgone while working extra hours unpaid. The rule would require employers to start paying overtime to workers earning salaries of less than $47,476 a year<U+2014>a threshold the business community and many states say is too big a jump from the current $23,660 last updated in 2004. Some workers whose salaries exceed the threshold can qualify for overtime pay depending on job duties. Even without court action, the fate of the rule has been far from assured as it also faces a possible strong challenge from Donald Trump, the president-elect who has vowed to roll back business regulations. The injunction was issued Tuesday by Judge Amos Mazzant in Texas. Judge Mazzant in the order said the challengers had made a sufficient case <U+201C>that the Department<U+2019>s salary level under the Final Rule and the automatic updating mechanism are without statutory authority.<U+201D> The Labor Department wasn<U+2019>t immediately available for comment. The legal challenges to the rule originated as two separate complaints<U+2014>one by a group of twenty-one states and the other by a coalition of more than 50 business groups. The plaintiffs, whose cases have since been consolidated, sought to overturn the rule on the grounds that it overstepped the government<U+2019>s authority. Among other things, the lawsuit originally filed by the states alleged that a mechanism in the rule that automatically will increase the overtime threshold every three years was finalized without going through a rule-making process plaintiffs contend is required by law. The plaintiffs said that step -- an unprecedented move made by the Labor Department<U+2014>means stakeholders won<U+2019>t have the chance to provide their input before the massive changes take effect.

        "original_post": "A national apartment building company said it would take President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s name off three New York City high-rises after tenants complained they were embarrassed living in buildings associated with someone who is so unpopular on Manhattan<U+2019>s West Side. Equity Residential , which owns tens of thousands of apartments across the U.S., told residents in an email that it would give the towers the more <U+201C>neutral<U+201D> names 140, 160 and 180 Riverside Blvd. Now, the buildings are all named Trump Place. The new names <U+201C>will appeal to all current and future residents,<U+201D> the email said. In the weeks leading up to the Nov. 8 election, hundreds of residents in the buildings signed a <U+201C>Dump the Trump Name<U+201D> petition. The buildings had his name emblazoned on the outside like many of the properties the billionaire has developed. The name is also on the carpet and on employees<U+2019> uniforms. Many New Yorkers were disappointed by Mr. Trump<U+2019>s surprise victory, and Manhattan has been the scene of many Trump protests. The decision by Equity Residential to rename the buildings is <U+201C>a little triumph after last week,<U+201D> said Kevin Dumont, a resident in one of the buildings. In a statement, the Trump Organization said: <U+201C>This recent change is simply the enforcement of a pre-existing agreement which has been in place for years. It was mutually agreed upon.<U+201D> The statement doesn<U+2019>t elaborate on when that agreement took place. Marty McKenna, a first vice president of Equity Residential, said: <U+201C>We have been speaking to the Trump Organization for some time regarding the use of the name. We agreed to wait until after the election to avoid being involved in the political situation.<U+201D> Mr. McKenna declined to say when those discussions started. Equity Residential<U+2019>s chairman is real estate mogul Sam Zell. A venture of Mr. Trump and a group of Hong Kong investors developed the buildings along the Hudson River in the 1990s. They were sold to Equity Residential in 2005. For decades, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s strategy has been to brand a range of products with his name to convey an image of wealth and success. That strategy began to backfire during the campaign when a wide range of companies began to distance themselves from his name because of his controversial remarks about immigrants, women and others. Earlier this year, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s hotel company decided to brand a new line of hotels without the Trump name. That brand, which is targeting a younger tech-savvy crowd, is called Scion.

        "original_post": "Thinking seriously about getting a job in Canada if your candidate loses the presidential election next week? You may face plenty of competition from your fellow Americans. Job searches by Americans looking for open roles in Canada are already up 58% this year over the total 2015 number, according to job site Monster. Between January and October, 30,296 queries from U.S. users included the keyword Canada, compared with 19,693 for all of 2015. That is still a small fraction of total searches; more than 69 million job queries are performed every month on Monster.com. The top occupations those users searched for up north were engineering and information technology, a sign that workers with critical expertise may be toying with the idea of relocating. Other popular searches were for accounting, banking, sales and human-resources positions. Monster doesn<U+2019>t have evidence that there is a direct connection between the data and a rancorous race that has sharply divided American voters. But the overlap is striking, says a Monster spokesman. Working in Canada isn<U+2019>t as simple as buying a ticket to Toronto, eh. Most foreign workers, temporary or permanent, must have a permit and a job offer from a Canadian firm, and the application process can be lengthy. Some professionals may be eligible for the Express Entry immigration process if they qualify as skilled workers , a designation based in part on work experience, education and language ability. The good news: for 2017, the Canadian government has approved a 7.4% increase , to 172,500, in the number of immigrants it will take through its economic programs, which include skilled workers. A separate survey from ZipRecruiter, also an online job platform, surveyed job seekers in late October and found that 47.8% planned to vote for Hillary Clinton and 39.8% for Donald Trump. The site reran its poll on Monday, following the news that the FBI was reviewing newly discovered emails of Mrs. Clinton. Support for Mrs. Clinton rose incrementally, to 48.5%, while Mr. Trump<U+2019>s moved to 39.9%. The remainder of expected votes mostly went to the third-party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein.

        "original_post": "MEXICO CITY<U+2014>Unemployment in Mexico fell to its lowest level in nine years in October amid strong private-sector job growth that has supported consumption and helped keep the economy expanding. Seasonally adjusted unemployment fell to 3.6% of the workforce last month from 3.8% in September and 4.4% a year before, helped in part by fewer people looking for work, the National Statistics Institute said Monday. It was the lowest unemployment rate since December 2007. Unemployment in the 32 largest cities fell to 4.4% from 5% in September and 5.1% a year earlier. The decline in unemployment has been slow but steady since the shock of the 2008-2009 crisis, to which the economy has been slow to adjust, said David Kaplan, a senior economist at the Inter-American Development Bank who specializes in labor markets. <U+201C>This shouldn<U+2019>t be interpreted as great news,<U+201D> he said, adding that although wages began rising a little more than inflation toward the end of 2014, they are still quite far from pre-crisis levels. Growth in jobs and wages, along with low inflation and increased consumer lending, have lifted <U+00A0>private consumption, which in turn fueled the 2.3% growth in economic output in the first three quarters of the year. Strength in consumption and the labor market likely gave the Bank of Mexico some comfort about the impact on the economy as it raised interest rates four times this year to confront peso weakness and the currency risk to inflation, Goldman Sachs Latin America economist Alberto Ramos said in a note. The jobs numbers and an apparent stabilization of the balance of payments suggest the economy may not be performing as far below capacity as generally perceived, although an expected economic slowdown and uncertainty following the election of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump could begin to undermine a so-far resilient labor market, he added. The Bank of Mexico last week lowered its economic growth forecast for 2017 by half a percentage point to 1.5%-2.5%. Labor Ministry data show the number of formal private sector jobs increased by 171,552 in October to 18.8 million, up 4.1% from a year before. The unemployment rate is based on a broader survey which takes into account public-sector workers, the self-employed and those employed in informal conditions. Informal employment rose to 57.4% of those in work from 56.9% in September, and underemployment<U+2014>people who have work but need more<U+2014>rose to 7.7% from 6.8%. The peso<U+2019>s fall to new lows against the U.S. dollar has also begun pushing up inflation as prices of imported goods rise. Annual inflation, which had been below the central bank<U+2019>s 3% target for 17 consecutive months through September, accelerated to 3.3% in mid-November.

Donald Trump<U+2019>s tax avoidance isn<U+2019>t just a story about Donald Trump. It<U+2019>s also a story about the American tax system and how kind it has been to the wealthy over the past few decades. The truly wealthy <U+2013> like those in the top 0.1 percent of earners <U+2013> paid more than half of their income in federal taxes in the 1950s, <U+2019>60s and <U+2019>70s. Since then, Washington has bestowed very large tax cuts on them, with declines in the top income-tax rate, the estate tax rate and corporate taxes. The wealthy have also become expert at dodging taxes, as Trump did. Over the same period, of course, the rich have received much bigger pre-tax pay increases than the middle class and poor. It is a double whammy of rising inequality. And it<U+2019>s unfair: much of the growing bounty from the American economy has flowed to a small slice of the population. The tax rates of the 1950s, <U+2019>60s and <U+2019>70s may well have been too high. But the current rates are still far below those levels <U+2013> and, again, pre-tax inequality is far higher. In today<U+2019>s economy, higher tax rates at the top make sense. My reading of the data is that President Obama<U+2019>s tax increases have closed about half of the gap between the lows of the total federal tax rate on the top 0.1 percent during George W. Bush<U+2019>s presidency and the highs of post-World War II years. Obama has effectively used the money to reduce inequality, paying for tax cuts for everyone else, health insurance, education and other programs, as well as deficit reduction. Here<U+2019>s where we return to Trump. His clearest policy proposal is a gigantic tax cut for the wealthy, reversing the progress Obama has made against inequality. Trump would shower $1.3 million a year on the average member of the top 0.1 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, wants to raise their taxes further (but still not to the levels of the post-War years). The larger meaning of Trump<U+2019>s tax avoidance seems quite clear. He<U+2019>s running for president partly to help other wealthy people be like him <U+2013> and avoid paying taxes. If you want to understand his economic agenda, look at his tax dodge.

        "original_post": "Gold is being let down by India and Donald Trump. Ahead of last week<U+2019>s U.S. presidential election, investors looking to bet on a victory by Mr. Trump bought gold assets on the theory that the resulting policy uncertainty would be a boost for such havens. But a week after his win, gold is hovering close to a six-month low of around $1,230 a troy ounce as investment flows out of gold-focused exchange-traded funds and gold futures. Instead of uncertainty markets seem to be expecting a strong U.S. economy, sending the dollar higher and gold<U+2014>which generally has an inverse relationship with the dollar, the currency in which it is priced<U+2014>lower. BMI Research cut its average-price forecast for 2017 to $1,300 an ounce from the previous $1,400. The Indian half of the gold-price pincer is also policy-driven. In a surprise announcement last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi <U+2014>seeking to curb counterfeiting, flush out tax-evading tycoons and uncover bribes stored in cash<U+2014> voided the highest-value currency (500 rupee and 1,000 rupee bills, worth about $7.50 and $15, respectively), requiring them to be turned in for new notes by Dec. 30. The result has been a cash crunch just ahead of the gold<U+2019>s peak demand time, the wedding season, which this year runs from Nov. 20 to Dec. 14. India vies with China as the world<U+2019>s top market for physical gold, between them accounting for half of global demand. <U+201C>The entire trade has come to a halt,<U+201D> says Mukesh Mehta, president of India Bullion and Jewellers Association. <U+201C>India seems to be moving towards a cashless economy.<U+201D> Compounding the cash crunch is market chatter that India may temporarily ban gold imports to choke off conversions of illegal cash stashes. <U+201C>That would negatively impact gold prices,<U+201D> said Simona Gambarini, commodities economist at Capital Economics. This has been a hard year for gold in India. Gold imports in the first nine months of 2016 were off an estimated 50% from a year earlier, driven down in part by a 1% excise tax on manufactured gold products that took effect earlier this year, prompting jewelers to close their shops in protest for several weeks starting in March. There was a brief surge in sales during October<U+2019>s festival month, but this week many jewelers<U+2019> shutters are down again. Traders cite the drop in demand and also merchants<U+2019> concern that tax authorities will be especially vigilant about gold sales during the currency changeover. As for the Trump effect, some analysts believe they just got the timing wrong. <U+201C>We still think that some of his policies are inflationary and that would not be bad for gold,<U+201D> a traditional inflation hedge, says Ms. Gambarini of Capital Economics. <U+201C>Markets (for risk assets) are being too optimistic based on the basis of a couple of speeches since he became president-elect.<U+201D> Write to Biman Mukherji at biman.mukherji@wsj.com",

The third and final piece of attack is a threat to investigate and potentially jail his opponent if he wins. <U+201C>If I win,<U+201D> he said at the second debate , <U+201C>I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.<U+201D> Trump also told Hillary Clinton <U+201C>you<U+2019>d be in jail<U+201D> if someone with his temperament were in charge of the justice system.

Trump has adopted the language of despots <U+2014> lie-filled accusations meant to delegitimize both his opponent and the country<U+2019>s entire democratic system of governance.

Trump drew 71.6 million viewers, the third-highest total ever for a presidential debate, according to data from Nielsen released on Thursday. The debate did not approach the record-setting first debate on Sept. 26, which had 84 million viewers , but it did surpass the second debate audience of 66.5 million . By this point, record ratings have become a familiar story line for this year<U+2019>s election cycle. Wednesday night closed out a 14-month debate season that featured two dozen debates, many of which set records, including: <U+25A0> The most-viewed debate ever (the first presidential debate). <U+25A0> The highest-rated primary debate and the highest-rated non-sports cable event ever (the first Republican debate, which drew 24 million viewers in August 2015). <U+25A0> The highest-rated Democratic debate ever (the first Democratic debate in October 2015 had 15.8 million viewers ). Chris Wallace of Fox News moderated Wednesday<U+2019>s debate and received something that<U+2019>s been elusive this election cycle for moderators: nearly universal praise. One of Mr. Wallace<U+2019>s questions provided the day<U+2019>s biggest headline. When Mr. Wallace pressed Mr. Trump on whether he would unequivocally accept the election results, he refused to say he would. <U+201C>I will keep you in suspense,<U+201D> he said. Unlike the first two presidential debates, Wednesday<U+2019>s debate did not go head-to-head against a National Football League game, though it did have competition from Game 4 of the National League Championship Series (The second debate on Oct. 9 ran opposite <U+201C>Sunday Night Football,<U+201D> so NBC did not broadcast the debate at all). Fox News had the highest ratings of any network on Wednesday, 11.3 million, besting ABC<U+2019>s 11 million, which ranked second. The ratings did not include streaming statistics or C-Span, so the total audience was most likely quite a bit larger.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump didn<U+2019>t respond to a request for comment. The mayor said his administration would fight any attempt to deport people in the city, any effort to undermine abortion rights and any movement to repeal the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as ObamaCare. Mr. de Blasio, who supported Democrat Hillary Clinton's White House bid, said he was <U+201C>still processing<U+201D> what the election might mean for the city. When asked what went wrong for Democrats and whether he thought Mrs. Clinton was the right person to be the Democratic nominee, Mr. de Blasio said he needed to give the issues more thought. The mayor said he was hopeful that he could work with Mr. Trump to increase investment in infrastructure. Mr. de Blasio said he was confident the city could protect the personal information of immigrants who had enrolled in a city identification card program from being used by the Trump administration for deportations. <U+201C>We are not going to sacrifice a half million people who live among us,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re not going to tear families apart. We will do everything we know how to do to resist that.<U+201D> Asked what his message was to Muslim New Yorkers, the mayor said: <U+201C>We have your back.<U+201D> During the campaign, Mr. Trump had recommended banning Muslims from entering the U.S. Mr. Trump has called Mr. de Blasio <U+201C>the worst mayor in the U.S.<U+201D> Write to Mara Gay at mara.gay@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "This is Queer Awareness Month at Columbia University. Yet instead of advocating for gay rights in the nearly 80 countries where homosexuality is a crime, the Columbia chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine is using the month for programming that defames Israel. <U+201C>Good Gay\/Bad Gay,<U+201D> for example, claims Israel has an <U+201C>imperialist LGBT agenda.<U+201D> The organization attacks Britain and the U.S. along similar lines. That is, Students for Justice in Palestine is denouncing Western criticism of the anti-gay bigotry of Arab and other governments. Such criticism, it says, is nothing more than a cynical tactic for the West to distract from its own imperialist oppression. This twisted perspective is integral to the anti-Israel movement and what it calls <U+201C>intersectional<U+201D> activism. <U+201C>Intersectionality<U+201D> argues that all victims of oppression<U+2014>racism, sexism, imperialism, classism, etc.<U+2014>should express solidarity with one another. The national Students for Justice in Palestine organization states in its mission statement: <U+201C>We believe that all struggles for freedom and equality are interconnected and that we must embody the principles and ideals we envision for a just society.<U+201D> Freedom, equality and justice<U+2014>all noble-sounding goals. The trouble is that on campuses across the country Students for Justice in Palestine puts its opposition to Israel at the fore of its activism, harming both the credibility of its supposed vision and the very people on whose behalf it claims to struggle. In March, for example, transgender-rights activist Janet Mock was prevented from speaking at Brown University by, among others, the campus chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine. Why? Because she was being hosted by a student group that operates under Hillel, the principal Jewish student organization on campus. Of the 10 countries that impose the death penalty for homosexual acts, nine do not have diplomatic relations with Israel. Students for Justice in Palestine apparently thinks it<U+2019>s more important to show solidarity with fellow Israel-haters in those countries than with the oppressed gays there. In the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza, homosexuality is not illegal, but gays are commonly intimidated by family members and others, and the government doesn<U+2019>t protect their rights. This is why many Palestinian gays flee to Israel, which has a thriving LGBT community and whose law recognizes same-sex relationships and protects gays from workplace discrimination. Reasonable people can differ about many aspects of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but treatment of gay people isn<U+2019>t one of them. Universities ought to be forums for intellectual discourse, and there should be ample room for clashing opinions and debate. But there should be no place for fraud. Students for Justice in Palestine is maligning Israel, insulting gays and discrediting itself. Mr. Feith, a junior at Columbia, is president of Aryeh: Columbia Students Association for Israel.",

        "original_post": "President-elect Donald Trump picked Sen. Jeff Sessions (R., Ala.) to be his attorney general, turning to one of his earliest supporters in Congress and a veteran conservative lawmaker to be the nation<U+2019>s top law enforcement official. Name: Jeff Sessions Age: 69 Education: B.A., Huntingdon College, Montgomery, Ala.; J.D., University of Alabama. Background: Mr. Sessions practiced law in Alabama and served as a U.S. attorney there for 12 years after a 1981 appointment by President Ronald Reagan. After being elected Alabama attorney general in 1994, he ran for the U.S. Senate in 1996. As a senator,<U+00A0>Mr. Sessions has been a leading lawmaker on the Senate Judiciary and Budget Committees. Outlook: The focus at the Justice Department is likely to shift considerably under Mr. Sessions, especially on issues of immigration, criminal justice and civil rights. Mr. Sessions has been a law-and-order conservative, criticizing President Barack Obama for commuting hundreds of prison sentences for drug offenders, as well as efforts by the Justice Department and U.S. Sentencing Commission to reduce criminal sentencing guidelines for certain drug offenses. He has expressed concerns about upticks in violent crime and argued the department should remain vigilant in federal drug prosecutions. A major opponent of illegal immigration, Mr. Sessions could play a supporting role in efforts by the Trump administration to deport undocumented immigrants, especially those with criminal records. As a U.S. attorney in the 1980s, Mr. Sessions was criticized for prosecuting three civil-rights activists for voter fraud, charges for which the defendants were acquitted. He also came under fire for saying that groups like the NAACP engaged in un-American activities. The Senate denied him a federal judgeship in 1986, amid concern that he was insensitive to minorities.

        "original_post": "OTTAWA<U+2014>As Canada braces for a new U.S. president who has vowed to shake up global trade , Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said<U+00A0>Thursday<U+00A0>he is open to talks with President-elect Donald Trump about ways to improve the plight of workers under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Trudeau said he spoke briefly<U+00A0>Wednesday<U+00A0>night with Mr. Trump, in which he told Mr. Trump he is ready to work constructively with the incoming administration on bolstering U.S-Canada ties. Canada<U+2019>s economy relies heavily on exports to the U.S. under Nafta, and Mr. Trump has vowed to repeal the agreement unless he can renegotiate better terms for Washington . <U+201C>If Americans want to talk about Nafta, I am more than happy to talk about it,<U+201D> the Canadian leader told reporters at an event in Sydney, Nova Scotia. <U+201C>We can look toward how to improve the benefits for workers and citizens and economic growth.<U+201D> Canadian officials have been relying on nonenergy exports to the U.S. to offset some of the fallout from lower commodity prices. Exports have disappointed though , prompting the Bank of Canada to downgrade the economic outlook, maintain its policy rate at 0.5% and <U+201C>actively<U+201D> discuss at recent meetings providing further easing to stoke growth. Canada<U+2019>s trade surplus with the U.S. climbed over the decades under Nafta, to roughly 117 billion Canadian dollars ($87.46 billion) last year from about C$37 billion in 1993, according to National Bank Financial. Roughly three-quarters of Canadian exports are U.S.-bound, so any<U+00A0>push by Mr. Trump <U+201C>to let air out of Nafta tires would be bad news for Canadian growth,<U+201D> economists at the investment bank said. While most of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s ire over Nafta is focused on Mexico, trade watchers suggest Mr. Trudeau must be at the table when it comes to any Nafta renegotiation<U+2014>if only to protect Canada from tariff increases. For now, Mr. Trump and his team will wait to see how Canada and Mexico react, said Eric Miller, head of the Washington-based Rideau Potomac Strategy Group, a consultancy that specializes in North American trade. <U+201C>They know Canada has to be at the table if this Nafta renegotiation is going to happen.<U+201D> Mr. Miller added that Mr. Trump and his team likely don<U+2019>t have much concern over Canadian trade, outside of certain agricultural products such as dairy, and lumber. In 2015, Canada was the U.S.<U+2019>s largest trading partner, with two-way trade<U+2014>exports plus imports<U+2014>totaling $671.5 billion, according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

        "original_post": "A top political adviser to former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has told allies he is considering running against Mayor Bill de Blasio next year, according to people familiar with the matter. But those close to the adviser, Kevin Sheekey, said they don<U+2019>t know whether he is serious. Mr. Sheekey, now an executive at Bloomberg LP, a financial news and information service founded by the former mayor, hasn<U+2019>t begun fundraising or building a campaign apparatus but has spoken with a number of people about the possibility, these people said. Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, is running for re-election in 2017. Messrs. Sheekey and Bloomberg didn<U+2019>t respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Mr. de Blasio said the mayor <U+201C>is happy to match his record against anyone.<U+201D> Mr. Sheekey, who has never held elected office, worked for the late U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York Democrat, and served in Mr. Bloomberg<U+2019>s administration for two terms. In 2010, he returned to Bloomberg LP, where he worked before Mr. Bloomberg ran for mayor. Mr. Sheekey, 50 years old, is known for his political savvy and has a reputation for floating trial balloons about the mayor to the news media. When one longtime aide to Mr. Bloomberg saw a 2015 New York Post article suggesting Mr. Bloomberg could run for mayor of London , the person joked: <U+201C>Looks like Kevin is bored.<U+201D> Mr. Sheekey was involved in unsuccessful efforts to convince Mr. Bloomberg to run for president. Over the summer, he traveled with Mr. Bloomberg, who won three terms as mayor on the GOP ticket but is now unaffiliated with any party, to Philadelphia for the Democratic National Convention. In recent weeks, Mr. Sheekey has posted <U+201C>Kevin Sheekey for Mayor<U+201D> buttons on social media, including Twitter. The buttons are a spoof made for a birthday party for Mr. Sheekey, people familiar with the matter said. Bradley Tusk, another Bloomberg adviser who ran Mr. Bloomberg<U+2019>s 2009 re-election campaign, launched a campaign earlier this year to unseat Mr. de Blasio. So far, Mr. Tusk has been looking for a candidate to run against the mayor with little luck. <U+201C>Kevin knows what competent, honest government looks like,<U+201D> said Mr. Tusk, a friend of Mr. Sheekey. <U+201C>Compare his experience with Bloomberg and Moynihan to de Blasio<U+2019>s bumbling tenure of corruption, ineptness and laziness, and the contrast is very strong.<U+201D> Mr. Sheekey, who lives on Manhattan<U+2019>s Upper West Side and is listed in Board of Elections records as a Democrat, may have a difficult time unseating Mr. de Blasio. Whether voters would want a mayor so closely linked to Mr. Bloomberg is unclear. Bill Lipton, who runs the union-backed Working Families Party, said Democrats would likely want to unite against a Donald Trump presidency instead of having an intraparty squabble. He said he wasn<U+2019>t sure if anyone would run against Mr. de Blasio. Still, Mr. Lipton said, <U+201C>anything can happen in politics.<U+201D> Write to Josh Dawsey at JOSHUA.DAWSEY@dowjones.com",

Earnings for black males rose 75% in the 1940s and another 45% in the 1950s. In the era of affirmative action, the black middle class has continued to expand, but at a slower rate than it was growing before.<U+201D> William Galston writes today that in response to anti-trade sentiment, policy makers must come up with <U+201C> responsible alternatives to both hyperglobalization and the populism it spawns . It may mean adopting policies that corporations oppose in order to broaden public support for an international market economy.<U+201D>",

        "original_post": "This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. Mark Lilla<U+2019>s much-discussed piece in yesterday<U+2019>s Times tapped into a debate about <U+201C>identity politics.<U+201D> Lilla argued that Democrats had lost the election by focusing on ethnicity, gender and sexuality rather than <U+201C>appealing to Americans as Americans and emphasizing the issues that affect a vast majority of them.<U+201D> His view fits with the post-election conventional wisdom: that Democrats must do better appealing to the white working class to regain power. I largely agree , but I also think that Democrats need to be careful about alienating their current constituencies <U+2014> particularly since many of those constituencies are growing. So I spent some time yesterday looking for critiques of Lilla, to think through their arguments. The core criticism was that Lilla was wrong to suggest the political left deserves blame for initiating the focus on racial (and other) groups. <U+201C>The label of <U+2018>identity politics<U+2019> is mostly ridiculous whenever used, because American politics historically was based on white male identity,<U+201D> Vann R. Newkirk II of The Atlantic wrote on Twitter. <U+201C>Trump<U+2019>s entire candidacy & now presidency was based on one of the most effective campaigns of identity politics in history.<U+201D> Likewise, Ira Madison III, at MTV.com, wrote : <U+201C>Trump is confirming racists and white nationalists for his cabinet, but it<U+2019>s the liberals focusing on identity politics that are getting us into trouble?<U+201D> You<U+2019>ll find similar points in the comments section of Lilla<U+2019>s article, including one from Sara , one of the first comments under <U+201C>Readers<U+2019> Picks.<U+201D> All of these arguments make a vital historical point: This country<U+2019>s deep racial problems stem from discrimination, not from oversensitivity about discrimination. And it would be a terrible mistake for anyone to shy away from criticizing Donald Trump<U+2019>s alarming choices for attorney general and chief White House strategist. At the same time, there<U+2019>s a reality that Democrats would be foolish to underestimate. This country<U+2019>s political system <U+2014> the rules for electing both Congress and the president <U+2014> is biased toward large, sparsely populated areas. Those areas tend to be overwhelmingly white. Unless Democrats can win more support from white voters than they did this year, the party will be left to complain about the country<U+2019>s political situation rather than do something about it.

        "original_post": "U.S. consumer sentiment surged in November, signaling rising confidence in the economy as the presidential campaign ended and Donald Trump was elected to the nation<U+2019>s highest office. The University of Michigan said Wednesday its final reading of consumer sentiment rose to 93.8 this month from a preliminary November reading of 91.6 and a final October reading of 87.2. <U+201C>The upsurge in favorable economic prospects is not surprising given Trump<U+2019>s populist policy views, and it was perhaps exaggerated by what most considered a surprising victory as well as by a widespread sense of relief that the election had finally ended,<U+201D> said Richard Curtin, the survey<U+2019>s chief economist. The preliminary November figure was based on interviews between Oct. 27 and Election Day. The final number, which was the highest since May, includes both pre- and post-election interviews. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a final November reading of 91.8. The post-election rise in optimism was widespread across different regions of the country, income and age groups. <U+201C>The gain was driven by a pop in assessments of the economic outlook, essentially a Trump honeymoon result, which may or may not last,<U+201D> said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities. The Michigan index had matched a two-year low in October, just as outcome of the bare-knuckles campaign appeared relatively uncertain. The turnaround was also apparent in subindexes. The survey<U+2019>s reading of current economic conditions jumped to 107.3 from October<U+2019>s final reading of 103.2. The gauge of future expectations climbed to 85.2 from 76.8.

        "original_post": "Hillary Clinton has spoken for years of the <U+201C>glass ceiling.<U+201D> What<U+2019>s one more night? Dispensing with subtlety, Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign said on Wednesday that it would ring in election night at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, the unglamorous glass fortress on Manhattan<U+2019>s West Side. The symbolism seems clear. Mrs. Clinton has referred repeatedly of busting through <U+201C>the highest, hardest glass ceiling<U+201D> <U+2014> at least figuratively <U+2014> by installing a woman in the Oval Office. If Election Day breaks her way, she will address the nation beneath a literal one. For Mrs. Clinton, it is a return to Manhattan after a campaign spent across the East River. Her headquarters are in Brooklyn, and when she clinched the Democratic nomination in June, she convened a celebration at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Correction: October 26, 2016 An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the convention center where Hillary Clinton will spend election night; it is the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, not Jacob J. Javits. The mistake also occurred in a caption.

        "original_post": "Reflation and monetary policy retreat are the themes of the day in the U.S. But in Europe, the latest inflation figures paint a different picture. The European Central Bank still has choppy waters to navigate. Eurozone inflation hit its highest level in November since April 2014, but at just 0.6%, it remained far adrift of the ECB<U+2019>s target of below but close to 2%. Headline inflation will rise further as the drag from energy prices turns into a boost: Citigroup forecasts a rate of 1.5% in the first quarter of 2017. That will raise more questions about the future of the ECB<U+2019>s bond-buying program, already the source of speculation in markets addicted to the flow of asset purchases. But core inflation<U+2014>excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco<U+2014>just isn<U+2019>t budging. It stood at 0.8% in November, the same as in the previous three months. Services inflation, a proxy for domestic price pressures, is just over 1%. While headline inflation is set to rise, it isn<U+2019>t clear that core will follow. Barclays forecasts average core inflation in 2017 of 1%. That, combined with the eurozone<U+2019>s still-high unemployment rate, provides backing for continued very accommodative monetary policy, even if the ability of central bankers to achieve their aims is increasingly in doubt. It remains to be seen whether the ECB can reframe the debate, while sticking to its mandate. A key judgment will be whether the rise in headline inflation is sustained. There could be greater discussion of pay dynamics<U+2014>the notes from the ECB<U+2019>s October meeting highlighted subdued growth in eurozone wages, up 1.1% from a year earlier in the second quarter. The market<U+2019>s focus at next week<U+2019>s ECB meeting will be on the exact details of bond purchases , particularly with political risk in Italy and France hitting bond markets and U.S. rates rising. But investors shouldn<U+2019>t lose sight of the big-picture backdrop of limp inflation. Write to Richard Barley at richard.barley@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "LONDON<U+2014>The U.K. and China on Thursday agreed to deepen ties between their financial services industries, in part of Britain<U+2019>s ongoing push to establish London as a global hub for Chinese finance that has gained added significance since the country voted to leave the European Union. The U.K. Treasury said in a statement that London and Beijing agreed to a <U+201C>strategic plan<U+201D> for financial services following a meeting in London between Treasury chief Philip Hammond and Chinese Vice Premier Ma Kai, who also met with Prime Minister Theresa May and Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney. The plan includes measures to permit British financial firms greater access to Chinese markets, and vice versa. The U.K. has for years sought to deepen its economic ties to the world<U+2019>s second-largest economy, a courtship that has drawn criticism from those uneasy about giving Chinese firms a foothold in potentially sensitive parts of industry . The U.K.<U+2019>s approach contrasts with the more-skeptical U.S., which is likely to grow more so under President-elect Donald Trump. Mr. Trump frequently castigated China and Chinese trade practices on the campaign trail. Some European nations are also cool on Chinese investment. Germany<U+2019>s economics ministry in October halted a <U+20AC>670 million ($728.89 million) Chinese acquisition of chip equipment-maker Aixtron SE , the latest sign of alarm about a wave of Chinese takeovers. For the U.K., though, bolstering trade and investment with faster-growing economies is a key plank of its post-Brexit strategy. Mrs. May visited India this week to talk up U.K.-India trade. As part of the financial-services accord announced Thursday, Beijing has agreed to let some British banks act as underwriters for so-called panda bonds, yuan-denominated debt issued to Chinese investors by non-Chinese firms, and to gradually relax rules that prevent foreign owners holding more than 50% of certain types of financial firms operating in China, including life insurance and mutual-fund companies. For its part, the U.K. has granted licenses permitting a handful of Chinese financial firms to open offices in London, including China Life Insurance Co. Ltd. and Shanghai Clearing House,<U+00A0>the Treasury said. There were also deals covering financial technology and green finance. <U+2014>Jenny Cross contributed to this article.

        "original_post": "Accept your emotions. Your feelings don<U+2019>t have to dictate your actions, says Susan David, a psychologist at Harvard Medical School and author of <U+201C>Emotional Agility.<U+201D> Research shows that people who suppress their feelings have a diminished sense of well-being, Dr. David says. They also find that emotions they have ignored will bubble up at the worst time. This <U+201C>amplification<U+201D> is what happens when you find yourself yelling at Aunt Gertrude across the Thanksgiving table. You can avoid this by processing your emotions. Dr. David, cautions against what she calls a common cognitive bias: We judge ourselves by our intentions but others by their actions. <U+201C>People are more than just one vote,<U+201D> she says. Plan for the <U+201C>if-then<U+201D> scenario. Coach yourself on how you might respond in a calm way if a certain topic comes up. Strategies might include reminding yourself to take deep breaths, or politely excusing yourself to help in the kitchen if you need a break. Remember that the other person is complex. No one is perfect. <U+201C>Everyone is trying to make sense of the world and do their best,<U+201D> says Dr. David. So try to see each family member as a well-rounded being. This doesn<U+2019>t mean you have to agree with them. But you need to recognize that they have other life experiences that have informed their views. Keep in mind what is shared. Did Grandpa teach you to ride a bike? Did you spend summers building forts with your cousins? Do your aunt and uncle love your children? Remember this. Just listen. Be silent and let the other person speak. Think of this as a spiritual practice, says Melinda Johnston, founder of the Buddhi Institute in Rochester, N.Y. This will allow the other person to be heard and to release his or her emotions, which will eventually lower the tension. The trick is to allow your rational mind, which will want to argue, to let go. It is fine to have the thought that your loved one is an idiot. But don<U+2019>t engage with your internal narrative. Think of your thoughts as clouds floating by. <U+201C>The goal is to offer each other kindness,<U+201D> says Ms. Johnston. <U+201C>And that is a gift.<U+201D> Use <U+201C>I<U+201D> but not <U+201C>you<U+201D> statements. <U+201C>I feel nervous,<U+201D> is fine. <U+201C>If someone tells me they are sad or angry or upset, I am empathic,<U+201D> says Emiliana Simon-Thomas, science director of the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley. <U+201C>But using a judgmental statement<U+2014>I am upset because of what you did<U+2014>is a difficult way to start a conversation.<U+201D> Take a cue from the Zulus. They have a greeting, <U+201C>Sawubona,<U+201D> that roughly translates as <U+201C>I see you, and by seeing you I bring you into being.<U+201D> Dr. David, who grew up in South Africa under Apartheid, says we need to see our own emotions and make room for them. And we need to see others as complex human beings. <U+201C>How can we bring our country together if we can<U+2019>t bring the holiday table together?<U+201D> she says. <U+2014>Elizabeth Bernstein",

If granted, the reprieve would put on hold court proceedings while the incoming Trump administration and House Republicans decide how to address the president-elect<U+2019>s promise to unwind or repeal the health law. <U+201C>In light of public statements by the president-elect and his campaign, there is at least a significant possibility of a meaningful change in policy in the new administration that could either obviate the need for resolution of this appeal or affect the nature and scope of the issues presented for review,<U+201D> the House<U+2019>s lawyers argued, suggesting the lawsuit could ultimately be dropped. Lawyers for the Obama administration opposed the delay. Congressional Republicans have been pushing for repeal of the health law since it was enacted in 2010. Mr. Trump has vowed to keep some of the more popular aspects such as a prohibition on insurance company discrimination against customers with pre-existing conditions, and a provision that allows young people to remain on their parents insurance through their mid-20s. At the heart of the lawsuit filed by the House of Representatives in 2014 is a dispute over billions of dollars in subsidies for low-income Americans to help them pay for health insurance on federal or state government insurance exchanges. Republicans have said Congress never appropriated the spending, while the Obama administration argues the subsidies were funded. A U.S. District Court judge sided with House Republicans in May, saying that Congress never funded the subsidies.

Democrats have begun to dream. They<U+2019>ve begun to dream of winning not only the White House and Senate but the House of Representatives too. In our polarized country, where many people vote for one party down the ticket, Donald Trump now trails Hillary Clinton by enough that the Democrats could win the 30 net seats they need to win House control. And with both the presidency and Congress, the party could go on a binge of policy making, much as it did in 2009 and 2010. It could do more to attack climate change. It could cut taxes for the middle class and poor while raising them on the rich. It could rebuild highways and invest in mass transit. It could fix the lingering problems with Obamacare. It could expand voting rights and workers<U+2019> ability to join a labor union. What stands between Democrats and this progressive wish list? One of the party<U+2019>s biggest weaknesses does. The Democrats are not very good at winning local and statewide elections in many places. As a Democratic officeholder recently said to me: The other side is better than us at the local level. For one thing, Democrats haven<U+2019>t yet hit on a successful strategy for turning out voters in midterm elections. That hurts them in congressional and governor races, as well as in state legislatures, which in turn allows Republicans to control the gerrymandering process. Democrats have also failed to build a strong bench of candidates. This year, Democrats did not even field a candidate in some districts. In others, the Democratic candidate seems too weak to create a competitive race. The Republican group that oversees its House campaigns recently chortled about the Democrats<U+2019> <U+201C>embarrassing recruiting failures and primary losses for their chosen candidates.<U+201D> In part, Democrats failed to recruit strong candidates because they did not imagine that they might win a blowout. But that<U+2019>s not really a good excuse. The stakes are too high, and the opportunity to change federal policy comes along too rarely. You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook .

        "original_post": "COPENHAGEN<U+2014>The Panama Canal Authority<U+2019>s chief executive is concerned about anti-trade rhetoric taking center stage in the U.S. election campaign, but he believes American consumers will step up their shopping after the result and boost shipping cargo volumes across the isthmus by a double-digit percentage. <U+201C>Talk of trade barriers and protectionism are a big part of the U.S. campaign, but globalization is here to stay and once the dust settles, we expect consumers will start buying again, boosting demand,<U+201D> Jorge L. Quijano told The Wall Street Journal on the sidelines of the Danish Maritime Forum conference. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized global trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for the repatriation of U.S. businesses with production lines outside the U.S. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has said she would work to improve trade agreements signed by previous administrations. The shipping industry moves the vast majority of the world<U+2019>s traded goods, from oil and food to electronics, clothes and cars. The Panama Canal<U+2014>a man-made waterway linking the Pacific and Atlantic oceans<U+2014>handles about a third of Asia-to-Americas trade. The Panama Canal Authority spent $5.4 billion for a new set of wider locks that opened in June, accommodating ships carrying up to 13,000 containers, rather than 5,000 containers previously. The American Association of Port Authorities expects around $155 billion will be invested by 2020 to expand U.S. ports to handle the bigger ships. South American terminals are also in an expansion race. Mr. Quijano said he expects cargo volumes through the canal to increase by 10% to 12% in the year ending September 2017, and continuous growth in coming years as the shipping industry emerges from one of its longest-ever downturns. Mr. Quijano expects the canal to generate $2.86 billion in revenue this fiscal year, up $350 million from last year. Containers make up 47% to 50% of the canal<U+2019>s revenue, bulk carriers around 20% and tankers around 15%, with other ships like car carriers and general cargo ships making up the remainder. Mr. Quijano said Panama doesn<U+2019>t plan to follow Egypt<U+2019>s Suez Canal in asking major shipping lines to pay tolls three to five years in advance in return for a 3% discount. <U+201C>In these difficult times, I think shipping companies would prefer to have flexibility in paying tolls rather than signing up to long-term commitments,<U+201D> he said. The new locks have made the Panama Canal more competitive with the Suez Canal, shortening the one-way journey by sea from Asia to the U.S. East Coast by roughly five days and eliminating the need for a trip around Cape Horn to get to the Atlantic. Some 6% of global trade in terms of capacity, or 340 million tons of goods, passed through the Panama Canal last year. Write to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "In Detroit, Hillary Clinton <U+2019>s winning margin was 90,000 votes smaller than President Barack Obama <U+2019>s in 2012. In Flint, Mich., where a water crises drew visits by both presidential candidates, the Democratic 2012 winning margin of 57,000 votes was cut by two-thirds. Turnout was down Tuesday, preliminary estimates show, but not uniformly. In urban areas that drive the Democratic tally in much of the industrial Midwest, there were signs African-American enthusiasm for Mr. Obama didn<U+2019>t fully transfer to Mrs. Clinton. In some of the smaller communities that powered Republican Donald Trump to victory, meanwhile, turnout appeared to rise. The number of votes cast statewide rose in Pennsylvania and Florida<U+2014>formerly Democratic states that Mr. Trump won<U+2014>as well as in Michigan, where he was maintaining a lead. But nationwide, fewer voters went to the polls. Mr. Trump appeared to have won the election, in fact, with fewer votes than GOP nominee Mitt Romney drew in his losing 2012 race. Mr. Trump in preliminary totals had about 59.6 million votes, 1.6 million shy of his party<U+2019>s total in the last election. The overall picture was of a decline in Democratic support in urban areas combined with a big increase in Republican margins in many communities outside urban areas. In Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan, Mr. Trump won rural communities and manufacturing centers. Stark County, Ohio, home to the steel-industry hub of Canton, had split its vote nearly evenly in 2012. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump carried the county by 17 points. Rural Clark County, Wis., backed Mr. Trump by 33 points, up from a 9-point GOP advantage in 2012. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory was unconventional: In a nation growing more urban, he was able to excite and turn out voters from small towns and rural communities that often draw little attention in American politics. He energized white, working-class voters without pushing away as many minority voters as many analysts and opinion surveys had predicted. While African-American voters declined slightly as a share of the electorate, Mr. Trump did slightly better among the group than the GOP did in 2012: He lost those voters by 80 points, compared with 87 in 2012. Earl Phillip, an African-American and former North Carolina campaign director for Mr. Trump, said surveys he conducted in swing states this year showed that some black voters saw Mr. Trump as a change agent who could rebuild communities. <U+201C>We don<U+2019>t get anybody willing to say <U+2018>Hey, I<U+2019>m willing to teach you how to fish so you can survive longer,<U+2019> <U+201D> he said<U+00A0>Wednesday. <U+201C>We get people saying, <U+2018>Here<U+2019>s the fish.

        "original_post": "KUALA LUMPUR<U+2014>Malaysia said it would deepen trade ties with China and other countries after Donald Trump <U+2019>s election in the U.S. likely torpedoed plans for an American-led free trade accord with Washington<U+2019>s chief Asia allies. Malaysia appeared to be the first Asian country to shift its focus toward a proposed China-led trade group rather than the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP), which the Obama administration freighted with strategic significance as a counterweight to China<U+2019>s rise. During the campaign, Mr. Trump outlined a more isolationist and protectionist vision for the U.S. Malaysia<U+2019>s trade minister said his government would focus its hopes on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a group led by China. The minister, Mustapa Mohamed, said TPP members would discuss the status of that accord next week during a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Lima, Peru, the first one since Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election. <U+201C>We hope to get more clarity when we meet next week,<U+201D> Mr. Mustapa said. Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress told the White House they won<U+2019>t advance the TPP in the election<U+2019>s aftermath , and Obama administration officials acknowledged it has no way forward now. China said it would seek support for the Beijing-led free-trade area in the Asia-Pacific during the Peru summit. China isn<U+2019>t part of the TPP. President Barack Obama is scheduled to attend the summit. Japan, a TPP member, will consider the possibility of renegotiating the TPP without the U.S., a top Japanese official said this week. He said the accord was a more comprehensive one than the RCEP because it included such principles as intellectual property protection. But Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Monday that he still believed the TPP had a chance. Japanese officials say they will try to make the case for it to the Trump administration. The TPP, which member governments agreed to in Atlanta last year , requires ratification of at least six countries, accounting for 85% of the total gross domestic product of the member 12 countries, to come into force. The U.S alone constitutes about 60% of that. The Obama administration has warned that failure of the TPP, which had underpinned the U.S. <U+201C>pivot<U+201D> to Asia, could result in China winning trade advantages at the expense of the U.S. <U+2014>Peter Landers in Tokyo contributed to this article.",

        "original_post": "Hillary Clinton <U+2019>s chances of winning the White House are increasing, if you believe political forecasters. But if you put your faith in the stocks that are supposed to benefit from the election outcome, it is Donald Trump <U+2019>s odds that are rising. Political surveys from the likes of FiveThirtyEight , CNN and PredictWise differed compared with the politically driven portfolios from two financial research firms that are constructed to benefit from the election<U+2019>s outcome. That might suggest a potential political surprise could be in the offing. The explanation is probably more prosaic: Political portfolios reflect conventional wisdom and can<U+2019>t account for surprise business developments or effective lobbying. New York-based Strategas Research Partners says its Republican portfolio has outperformed its Democratic portfolio for four straight days. Separately, research firm Cornerstone Macro says its Clinton portfolio was outperforming its Trump portfolio by about two percentage points prior to last week<U+2019>s presidential debate. That was among the widest gaps since mid-July. Since then, however, its Trump portfolio has not only recovered but is now beating Clinton<U+2019>s, even following her solid debate performance.<U+00A0>The<U+00A0>Trump portfolio is bullish on energy and defense stocks whereas its Clinton portfolio favors infrastructure and alternative energy stocks. Daniel Clifton, head of policy research at Strategas, says its Democratic portfolio has been hampered by an unexpected decline in healthcare stocks. Generic drug company Mylan , a Clinton stock, has fallen on EpiPen pricing issues. Additionally, he suggests polls may be too optimistic about Ms. Clinton<U+2019>s prospects. A broader takeaway is the danger of making political bets in the stock market. Individual company news often supersedes the broader political backdrop.

Yet health care has been one of the S&P 500<U+2019>s top-performing sectors during much of the current bull market. Firearm stocks also have beaten the market by a significant margin, even as Mr. Obama has called for new restrictions on gun sales. Companies tend to adjust to new political, economic and regulatory environments, with their stock prices reacting accordingly. Mixing politics and portfolios can be a dangerous recipe.

        "original_post": "OTTAWA<U+2014>The Bank of Canada wouldn't respond mechanically to any future move by the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, a senior central bank official said Wednesday. Speaking before an audience in Waterloo, Ontario, Deputy Governor Timothy Lane said tighter monetary policy in the U.S. would lead to higher market interest rates globally, producing a tightening effect for Canada. At the same time, he said, a U.S. rate increase should result in a stronger U.S. dollar, making Canadian exports more competitive. Mr. Lane said the Bank of Canada wouldn<U+2019>t consider those impacts in any <U+201C>mechanical<U+201D> way. Instead, the central bank can observe the effects of a U.S. move on interest rates and exchange rates before making a policy decision. <U+201C>We are free to adjust our policy interest rate in the context of Canadian economic conditions<U+2014>and, in particular, do not need to move in step with the Federal Reserve,<U+201D> Mr. Lane said. BMO Capital Markets economist Doug Porter said the Bank of Canada has made it clear in the past that it doesn't need to follow the Federal Reserve on policy moves. For example, he said, Canada<U+2019>s central bank cut its key interest rate twice in 2015, at a time when the Fed was preparing for its first rate increase since the financial crisis. <U+201C>I think they<U+2019>ve truly shown over the last couple of years that they<U+2019>re not joined at the hip with the Fed,<U+201D> Mr. Porter said. Mr. Lane<U+2019>s comments were included in a speech on financial globalization, in which he made the case that a sound financial system and good governance have allowed Canada to benefit from the free movement of capital. Asked about Donald Trump <U+2019>s election win during a question-and-answer session after the speech, Mr. Lane said it was too early to comment on what the new administration might mean for Canada. However, he said the Bank of Canada would watch closely for future announcements on U.S. fiscal and trade policies. <U+201C>These are things we would factor into our economic outlook and forecasting, but at this point, I think it<U+2019>s really too early to gauge what those effects will be, and what effect they might also have on business confidence,<U+201D> he said. Mr. Trump said during the election campaign that he would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement , comments that have raised concerns in Canada over future access to U.S. markets. Canada sends about three-quarters of its exports to the U.S. Many economists expect the Bank of Canada to leave its key interest rate at 0.5% through 2017 amid a sluggish export recovery and persistently weak business investment. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, is expected to increase interest rates at its December policy meeting. Write to Kim Mackrael at kim.mackrael@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who clashed with the Obama administration<U+2019>s Pentagon and intelligence establishment over the U.S. fight against global extremism, has been selected as President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s White House national security adviser, putting him in the upper ring of the nation<U+2019>s security policies. Name: Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (retired) Age: 57 Education: University of Rhode Island, Golden Gate University (Calif.), Ft. Leavenworth (Kan.), United States Naval War College. Background: Gen. Flynn served in many military intelligence posts throughout his 33-year career, including as director of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and intelligence adviser to Gen. Stanley McChrystal in Iraq and Afghanistan. Outlook: He became known as a maverick within the ranks of the normally deferential and apolitical corps of <U+201C>general officers,<U+201D> the military<U+2019>s top-ranking officials. In 2010, Gen. Flynn published a paper lambasting the military intelligence community for deficiencies in its approach to intelligence collection, taking the unusual step of releasing the study through the Center for a New American Security, a center-left think tank in Washington. Still, he rose through the ranks. His military career culminated in his 2012 appointment to run the Defense Intelligence Agency. During his two-year tenure there, Gen. Flynn tried to overhaul the way the U.S. military treats intelligence but also clashed with superiors and counterparts, officials and colleagues said. Ultimately, James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, and Michael Vickers, then-undersecretary of defense for intelligence, removed him from the post in 2014, forcing his retirement. In a July 9, 2016, article in the New York Post , Gen. Flynn wrote that he had been fired for the stand he took <U+201C>on radical Islamism and the expansion of al Qaeda and its associated movements,<U+201D> describing his anger at the decision. Gen. Flynn argued that the Obama administration rested on its laurels after killing Osama bin Laden in 2011 and underestimated the depth of the threat from al Qaeda and its remnants. Others suggested different reasons for Gen. Flynn<U+2019>s dismissal. Colin Powell, the former secretary of state and onetime chairman of the military<U+2019>s Joint Chiefs of Staff, described Gen. Flynn in a July 19, 2016, email as someone who was <U+201C>abusive with staff, didn<U+2019>t listen, worked against policy, bad management, etc.<U+201D> That email and others was stolen by hackers and released. Gen. Flynn in recent months promoted a view, backed by Mr. Trump on the campaign trail, that the Pentagon shouldn<U+2019>t talk about its campaign to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul from Islamic State and instead conceal its operations. Defense Secretary Ash Carter later disputed the matter, saying Islamic State followers needed to see that the attack was occurring to undercut the group<U+2019>s claims to the establishment of a caliphate. Former military officials also questioned whether a large-scale concealed attack on Mosul, a city of about a million people, would be possible given the size and scope of the campaign.

        "original_post": "No matter the outcome of<U+00A0>Tuesday<U+2019>s<U+00A0>election, American companies with substantial overseas earnings, and their investors, could emerge as big winners. Corporate tax reform that would make it easier for U.S. firms to repatriate foreign earnings has emerged as a rare issue of bipartisan consensus in Washington. Progress on this issue is possible no matter who controls the White House and Congress next year. Investors in big, widely held companies like Apple Inc. would stand to benefit. Under current law, American companies with overseas earnings pay no U.S. federal tax on these profits unless and until they repatriate the money, at which time they pay the relatively high corporate tax rate of 35%. This creates a perverse incentive for U.S. companies to house money abroad rather than reinvest it at home. Republican candidate Donald Trump has proposed that past earnings stashed abroad could be repatriated at a special rate of just 10%. Republicans in the House of Representatives have an even more generous proposal that would allow repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings at a rate of just 3.5% to 8.75%. They would also change the basis of tax law such that much revenue earned overseas wouldn<U+2019>t be taxed at all going forward. Hillary Clinton hasn<U+2019>t made any specific proposals on how to tax overseas earnings. Nonetheless, there is substantial scope for bipartisan agreement on this issue. President Barack Obama <U+2019>s recent budget proposals called for a special rate of 14% on repatriated earnings, and a new, lower tax rate of 19% on foreign earnings thereafter,<U+00A0>even if they aren<U+2019>t repatriated. Even in a divided-government scenario, for example with Mrs. Clinton as President and a Republican-controlled Congress, it seems likely that companies can look forward to a one-time break on repatriated earnings and a lower tax rate on foreign earnings going forward. The last time there was such a repatriation tax holiday was in a law passed in 2004, and the effects were dramatic. Companies brought home $299 billion of overseas earnings in 2005, up from $82 billion the previous year, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That level hasn<U+2019>t been reached in any year since. The 2004 law contained language trying to prevent that money from being used to buy back company shares . But money is inherently fungible, and it appears that a substantial portion of the funds went to buybacks, which surged by 58% in 2005, according to Goldman Sachs. A similar tax holiday now, and a settlement on how to treat foreign earnings in the future, would disproportionately benefit American companies with big global operations. This includes technology companies like Apple, which has $92 billion of earnings invested overseas and gets almost two-thirds of its revenue from outside the U.S., according to Goldman. General Electric has $104 billion stashed abroad and derives 55% of sales from overseas. Other likely winners include oil majors like Exxon Mobil Corp. and consumer giants like PepsiCo . It has been a long and dispiriting campaign season. But, as it draws to a close, investors in some of America<U+2019>s top companies can look forward to at least one positive outcome.",

        "original_post": "To listen to Donald Trump describe the American economy is to hear about a horrifying alternate reality in which the recession that started at the end of 2007 is still with us. The truth is very different. The recovery that began in the middle of 2009, though not perfect, has steadily created jobs and lifted wages. More than 15.2 million jobs have been added since early 2010. The 4.9 percent unemployment rate is half of what it was in the depths of the recession in 2009. On Friday, in its monthly employment report, the Department of Labor said that average hourly wages jumped 2.8 percent, to $25.92, in October from a year earlier, the biggest such increase since 2008. Add these findings to a recent report from the Census Bureau showing a decline in the number of people in poverty and the percentage of people without health insurance, and it is clear that by almost every economic measure the country is doing better than it was just a few years ago. Mr. Trump refuses to acknowledge these truths, presumably because he believes that his best shot at the White House is to insist that the economy is in terrible shape and that he alone can fix it. When the data don<U+2019>t agree with his dystopian vision, he calls them <U+201C> phony numbers .<U+201D> His campaign called Friday<U+2019>s employment report <U+201C> disastrous .<U+201D> Little wonder that 370 economists, including eight Nobel Prize winners, have signed a letter denouncing him for peddling <U+201C>magical thinking and conspiracy theories over sober assessments of feasible economic policy options.<U+201D> There is no doubt that the economic recovery has not touched every American equally. About one-quarter of the unemployed, or two million people, have been out of work for 27 weeks or more . Some 81 percent of people between the prime working ages of 25 and 54 are in the labor force (employed or looking for work), an increase from last year but still lower than in early 2007 when it was 83 percent. The poverty rate fell to 13.5 percent last year, from 14.8 percent, but it is higher than it was in the late 1990s and early 2000s. For many people, health insurance remains too expensive. The next president and Congress need to focus on those whom the recovery has left behind. Hillary Clinton would increase investments in infrastructure, help lower the burden of student loans and expand access to affordable health care. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s main policy idea is to cut taxes for the wealthy, a reprise of the old trickle-down economics that has consistently failed. His plans to impose big tariffs on imports would start a trade war, leading to big job losses, and his vow to repeal the Affordable Care Act could strip as many as 20 million people of their health insurance. Better policies could make the economy stronger. Mrs. Clinton has them. Mr. Trump does not.

        "original_post": "From the drama over Donald Trump<U+2019>s cabinet you<U+2019>d think the only position in government is Secretary of State. Yet Mr. Trump will need advice elsewhere, not least in taming the regulatory state. Newt Gingrich said he won<U+2019>t serve in a Trump cabinet but would like to contribute. How about tapping the former House Speaker to lead a Gingrich Commission to modernize and shrink the federal government? The models for this project would be the Hoover Commissions of the 1940s and early 1950s. President Harry Truman appointed former President Herbert Hoover to look for ways to streamline government in 1947, and Dwight Eisenhower did it again in 1953, and about 70% of the proposals were adopted in the two Administrations. Congress combined several agencies into what is now the General Services Administration, which reduced paperwork and federal procurement costs. There<U+2019>s also the 1980s Grace Commission, which made nearly 2,500 recommendations on everything from farm-credit rules to Pentagon hardware. The Grace Commission accomplished less than its predecessors thanks to a Democratic Congress, but it provoked a public debate about the role of government. A Gingrich Commission would have an opening for greater progress with a GOP White House and Congress. There<U+2019>s always a chance that the effervescent Mr. Gingrich would careen off course by proposing a military base on the moon. But he talks all the time about updating government for the 21st century, and he published a book on <U+201C>winning the future<U+201D> that covers everything from education to balancing the federal budget. This would be a chance to do it. The feds over the decades have piled program atop program regardless of results, and a commission could highlight failures and duplications. Unlike previous eras, much of the work has already been done by think tanks or other commissions. The commission could work fairly rapidly, perhaps in a few months. For example: Speaker Paul Ryan <U+2019>s <U+201C>Better Way<U+201D> agenda has identified some 80 welfare programs run by 13 federal agencies, and inevitably many overlap in benefits and eligibility. That seems ripe for a closer look. President-elect Trump has singled out civil-service reform as a priority, and Paul Light of New York University has suggested ideas on these pages that the Gingrich Commission could review. Over the next year Congress and the new Administration will be preoccupied with daily squalls and the rough and tumble of passing legislation. There<U+2019>s no time for research. A Gingrich Commission could do that work and serve up ideas to plug into the budget over the next two years and beyond. Government is at its lowest standing with Americans in decades, so even progressives should support an effort that might improve its functioning and lay the basis for more public confidence.",

        "original_post": "President Obama said in Peru Sunday that he is <U+201C>not optimistic<U+201D> about ending the violence in Syria any time soon, in an understatement for the ages. The United Nations says a million Syrians are under siege across that country, especially in Aleppo where Russia, Iran and the Bashar Assad regime ramp up what they hope will be their final assault on rebel positions. One hospital was still functioning in eastern Aleppo as of Sunday night, after the city was hit by some of the heaviest air and artillery bombardments of the six-year war. The axis of Assad more or less has a free hand given that the rest of the world lacks the will to help or protect the rebels. Turkey<U+2019>s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blamed everyone else for the charnel house on Monday, demanding that the U.S. and its allies reconsider a no-fly zone to protect civilians and refugees. He has a point, but he ought to include himself in the bill of indictment because for years he resisted U.S. pleas to assist the rebels unless the goal included toppling the Assad government. President Obama, true to his instincts to the end, has no appetite for even a humanitarian intervention. And without U.S. leadership, nobody else does either. Mr. Obama was left to plead with Vladimir Putin in Peru Sunday to do something, but their exchange amounted to little more than a handshake and cold stare. Mr. Putin knows he and his allies can do what they want safe from consequence save moral denunciations. Mr. Obama won<U+2019>t muster even that. The conquest of Aleppo may be complete by the time Donald Trump becomes President in two months, not that he has shown much desire to act. On Monday he met with Tulsi Gabbard, the Hawaii Democrat and Bernie Sanders supporter, to discuss Syria and perhaps a job as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Ms. Gabbard would fit right in because she wants to do nothing about Syria, and neither does a U.N. blocked by vetoes at the Security Council by Russia and China. The point to understand is that Syria is what the world looks like when the U.S. decides to abandon world leadership: The Pax Americana becomes Mr. Putin<U+2019>s peace of the grave.",

        "original_post": "New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan won her state<U+2019>s U.S. Senate seat, defeating Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte in one of the most expensive races this year. Ms. Hassan had 48.0% of the vote, compared with 47.9% for Ms. Ayotte<U+2014>a difference of just 716 votes with all precincts reporting<U+2014>when Ms. Ayotte conceded Wednesday. <U+201C>It has been a tremendous privilege to serve New Hampshire in the Senate,<U+201D> Ms. Ayotte said in a statement. <U+201C>This is a critical time for New Hampshire and our country, and now more than ever, we need to work together to address our challenges.<U+201D> Ms. Hassan, a well-liked governor, presented a potent threat to the popular Republican senator from the beginning of her campaign. An early ad depicting her upbeat family getting her son, who has cerebral palsy, off to school showed a warm personal side. Ms. Hassan, 58 years old, also touted her pragmatism, emphasizing themes like cutting wasteful spending, which made her sound almost like a Republican. Breaking with her party, Ms. Hassan was the only Democratic governor to call for a temporary ban on Syrian refugees. The two candidates spent much effort trying to tie their opponents to their party<U+2019>s presidential candidates. Ms Ayotte stumbled when she said she considered GOP nominee Donald Trump a role model for children, a statement she later rescinded. Ms. Hassan got into trouble when she declined to say whether she thought her party<U+2019>s candidate, Hillary Clinton, was honest and trustworthy, eventually saying she did believe that the nominee could be trusted. Ms. Ayotte, 48, campaigned as an independent-minded Republican who would break with her party to help her state, such as when she stuck up for curbs on power-plant emissions. At one point in the campaign she said she couldn<U+2019>t vote for Mr. Trump<U+2014>a risky move because of the potential for alienating his supporters in a race with little margin for error. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s supporters were furious but ultimately returned to the GOP fold. Both parties funneled money into the contest. By the Friday before the election, outside groups and the campaigns had spent a combined $120 million in the tiny state, or roughly $131 for each of the 919,126 registered voters.

        "original_post": "The consensus by United States intelligence agencies is that the WikiL eaks dump of emails from the account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s campaign chairman, was the result of a hack by Russia in an effort to influence the presidential election. The leaks are continuing, so it<U+2019>s impossible to say whether anything truly damaging to Mrs. Clinton will emerge. Some of the purloined exchanges consist of routine and often boring campaign planning, while others seem embarrassing or cynical, as when Clinton aides debate accepting campaign cash from foreign government lobbyists, and one writes: <U+201C>Take the money!!<U+201D> None of the emails, at least so far, seem particularly harmful to Mrs. Clinton, although some suggest that her closest aides have the same concerns that weigh on many Americans <U+2014> that she can be thin-skinned and secretive. As Neera Tanden, one of Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s closest advisers, put it in the emails , <U+201C>She always sees herself bending to <U+2018>their<U+2019> will when she hands over information.<U+201D> This is partly because of the endless investigations the Clintons<U+2019> political enemies have pursued over the years. But that sort of scrutiny will surely intensify if she becomes president. Mrs. Clinton will only stir up her Republican critics by appearing secretive; she has a much better chance of shutting them down, as she did in her Benghazi hearing, with a dogged determination to show she has nothing to hide. Fuller disclosure would clearly have helped her when it came to her lucrative speeches to Wall Street, a matter that has dogged her throughout this campaign. While she has released a full list of her speeches and fees, Mrs. Clinton has consistently refused to release the transcripts. From the snippets seen in the emails, one wonders why. One speech has been politically problematic <U+2014> a 2013 presentation to Brazil<U+2019>s Banco Ita<U+00FA> in which she said, <U+201C>My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future.<U+201D> Mr. Trump pounced on this as evidence that Mrs. Clinton favored unfettered immigration <U+2014> which seemed misleading given her long support for strong border security. Over all, the excerpts from WikiLeaks suggest that Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s speeches were what one would expect for audiences interested in global investment: talk about incentivizing growth and spurring entrepreneurship. Imagine if months ago, Mrs. Clinton had done her own giant information release, including hundreds of pages of speeches to Goldman Sachs and Citi, to Salesforce.com, the United Fresh Produce Association and the Cardiovascular Research Foundation. Journalists and the public could have waded through them, discussed them, written about them <U+2014> and by now, everyone would have long since moved on.

        "original_post": "The National Football League has sent a memo to team owners seeking to ease concerns about the ratings decline that has hit football this fall. Through the first four weeks of the season, NFL viewership has declined 11%, and among the crucial adults 18-49 demographic that advertisers covet, ratings are down 12%. <U+201C>While our partners, like us, would have liked to see higher ratings, they remain confident in the NFL and unconcerned about a long-term issue,<U+201D> the letter from NFL senior executives Brian Rolapp and Howard Katz said, adding that over the last 15 years, ratings viewership has grown 27% and that football <U+201C>continues to be far and away the most powerful programming on television and the best place for brands and advertisers.<U+201D> The league said the large drop in ratings for prime-time games on ESPN, CBS and NBC is likely because of <U+201C>unprecedented interest in the Presidential election.<U+201D><U+00A0>On Sunday<U+00A0>afternoons, the audience for Fox News, CNN and MSNBC has increased as well, and the league believes that is cutting into those games. The letter also cited the 2000 election as another time when NFL ratings took a hit due to coverage of the race between George Bush and Al Gore and the subsequent legal battle over the results. As for a potential backlash by some viewers angered at players not standing for the national anthem to protest of police brutality, the NFL said it sees no evidence to that being a factor in declining ratings: <U+201C>In fact, our own data shows that the perception of the NFL and its players is actually up in 2016.<U+201D> The NFL said it was issuing the memo to all the teams in response to media inquiries about the decline in ratings. Long seen as invincible against the trends and changing media habits that have negatively affected other programming, network executives and advertisers have been scrambling to figure out if this is a short-term blip because of political news or the start of a long-term trend. Not everyone is convinced that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are solely to blame. Some industry analysts note that as the NFL continues to place product on more digital platforms , a negative hit to the broadcast partners is more likely. Others cite that the NFL may have hit saturation level with games on all day<U+00A0>Sunday,<U+00A0>as well as a<U+00A0>Monday<U+00A0>and<U+00A0>Thursday<U+00A0>game. In addition to the election coverage and some fans angered at the protests, another factor NFL media chief Brian Rolapp cited i n a Wall Street Journal interview was the absence of some marquee players due to injury and retirement, as another possible cause of the lower ratings. Interestingly, ratings for college football have been up this season.",

        "original_post": "ARCADIA, Wis.<U+2014>Small towns in the Midwest have diversified more quickly than almost any part of the U.S. since the start of an immigration wave at the beginning of this century.<U+00A0>The resulting cultural changes appear to be moving the political needle. A Wall Street Journal analysis of census data shows that counties<U+00A0>in a distinct cluster of Midwestern states<U+2014>Iowa, Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota<U+2014>saw among the fastest influxes of nonwhite residents of anywhere in the U.S. between 2000 and 2015. Hundreds of cities long dominated by white residents got a burst of Latino newcomers who migrated from Central America or uprooted from California and Texas. That shift helps explain the emergence of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump as a political force, and signals that tensions over immigration will likely outlive his candidacy. Among GOP voters in this year<U+2019>s presidential primaries, counties that diversified rapidly were more likely to vote for the New York businessman, the Journal<U+2019>s analysis shows. Mr. Trump is emphasizing the Midwest this week, with a stop in Wisconsin scheduled for Tuesday. In Arcadia, Wis., Don Leibl saw the dairy-farming hamlet transform from nearly all white to more than one-third Latino as Mexican immigrants streamed in for jobs. It is a main reason,<U+00A0>he said,<U+00A0>he is voting for Mr. Trump for president. <U+201C>If you<U+2019>d seen the way things have changed in this town , you<U+2019>d say, <U+2018>Something needs to be done about it,<U+2019> <U+201D> the 51-year-old computer systems analyst said, referring to immigrants there illegally. In this western Wisconsin enclave and other pockets of the rural Midwest, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s pledge to build a wall along the Mexican border and prioritize jobs for American<U+00A0>workers has struck a chord with some whites uneasy over rapidly changing demographics. They said they are worried illegal immigrants are crowding schools and unfairly tapping public assistance, problems they believe Mr. Trump would fix. The Journal identified the epicenter of this shift using the diversity index, a tool often used by social scientists and economists.

The threat lacked specificity, officials said. Over the weekend, Islamic State called for attacks on the U.S. on Election Day, officials said. In a show of confidence Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Mr. O<U+2019>Neill appeared together alongside NYPD and Secret Service officials in Times Square. They said the city was accustomed to dealing with large events and was prepared to deal with possible terrorism, protests or voter intimidation. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump are both slated to hold election-night events in Manhattan. Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s event is scheduled to be at the Javits Center on the far West Side, and Mr. Trump<U+2019>s event is at the New York Hilton Midtown on Sixth Avenue. <U+201C>We have an obligation not only to the people of this city but to this country to make sure that tomorrow all through the day and particularly tomorrow night goes smoothly,<U+201D> said Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat. <U+201C>New York City will never be intimidated.<U+201D> NYPD officials said some 5,000 officers would be out on the streets Tuesday, a force that will include heavy-weapons teams, counterterrorism units, bomb-sniffing dogs and hundreds of plainclothes officers looking for suspicious activity. They also said officers will be posted at polling sites and would respond to any possible incidents of voter suppression. Officials said New Yorkers can expect security measures to feel similar to those taken on New Year<U+2019>s Eve. John Miller, the NYPD<U+2019>s deputy commissioner for counterterrorism and intelligence, called the approach <U+201C>an all-out posture<U+201D> that has become <U+201C>part of the new normal for New York City.<U+201D> Police officials said they had taken extra security measures because both major candidates were expected to be in New York City on Tuesday night. The city will see extensive traffic closures. Beginning Tuesday morning, 34th Street will be closed, as well as 11th Avenue between 34th and 40th streets. The area surrounding Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue will be closed while Mr. Trump is in the building, as will the area surrounding the Hilton. Mr. O<U+2019>Neill said keeping the city safe was a shared responsibility. <U+201C>If anyone sees something tomorrow that doesn<U+2019>t look right, doesn<U+2019>t feel right, let one of our officers know about it,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>Or call 911.<U+201D> Write to Mara Gay at mara.gay@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "LeBron James , who last season led the Cleveland Cavaliers to their first N.B.A. championship , endorsed Hillary Clinton for president on Sunday. Mr. James announced his decision in an op-ed article in Business Insider, saying that Mrs. Clinton understands the struggles of childhood poverty and as president would enact policies that would build on the legacy of President Obama. He also said he believed Mrs. Clinton would champion causes for children, provide more educational opportunities and <U+201C>address the violence, of every kind, the African-American community is experiencing.<U+201D> <U+201C>Only one person running truly understands the struggles of an Akron child born into poverty,<U+201D> wrote Mr. James, who grew up in Akron and who praised his own foundation<U+2019>s efforts to help at-risk young people. <U+201C>And when I think about the kinds of policies and ideas the kids in my foundation need from our government, the choice is clear. That candidate is Hillary Clinton .<U+201D> Mr. James is popular across the country and particularly in Ohio, but it is unclear how much his endorsement of Mrs. Clinton will influence the race with her opponent Donald J. Trump . Most recent surveys show Mr. Trump with a slight edge among voters in Ohio. A Suffolk University poll from September put him at 42 percent, compared to 39 percent for Mrs. Clinton. His double-digit leads among men and white voters are crucial to his standing in the state. Mr. James, who has been outspoken about recent police killings of black men and women, wrote that Mrs. Clinton would seek to improve life for African-Americans. <U+201C>Finally, we must address the violence, of every kind, the African-American community is experiencing in our streets and seeing on our TVs,<U+201D> he wrote. <U+201C>However, I am not a politician, I don<U+2019>t know everything it will take finally to end the violence. But I do know we need a president who brings us together and keeps us unified.<U+201D> <U+201C>Policies and ideas that divide us more are not the solution,<U+201D> he continued. <U+201C>We must all stand together <U+2014> no matter where we are from or the color of our skin. And Hillary is running on the message of hope and unity that we need.<U+201D> Mr. James is one of several athletes who have weighed in on the presidential race. The golfer John Daly, the former football star Herschel Walker and the former basketball coach Bob Knight have endorsed Mr. Trump, according to Sports Illustrated. The magazine also said that the former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan and the former N.B.A. player Dennis Rodman have expressed support for Mr. Trump.

        "original_post": "Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is taking a leave of absence from the law firm he joined earlier this year, Greenberg Traurig LLP, as his support of Donald Trump <U+2019>s presidential race ramps up. Greenberg<U+2019>s executive chairman, Richard Rosenbaum, said in a statement that the departure is an <U+201C>amicable and mutual leave of absence<U+201D> and the firm looks forward <U+201C>to his intended return<U+201D> in November. In his own statement, Mr. Giuliani said he intends to return the day after the election and characterized the move as a decision he made <U+201C>due to the time I want to commit to the campaign.<U+201D> Mr. Giuliani has become an ardent and outspoken supporter and defender of Mr. Trump in recent months. Following the recent leak of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s tax returns by the New York Times showing Mr. Trump reported a $916 million loss in 1995, Mr. Giuliani told NBC that, <U+201C>Great men have big failures. And then they take those failures and they turn them into great results.<U+201D> He also praised Mr. Trump<U+2019>s tax strategy on his Twitter feed, saying the Republican candidate should be <U+201C>applauded for figuring out how to avoid paying taxes for 30 years by astutely gaming the system, legally.<U+201D> Mr. Rosenbaum circulated an internal memo to Greenberg shareholders Wednesday about Mr. Giuliani<U+2019>s leave, stressing that the firm doesn<U+2019>t take political stances, though its attorneys are welcome to support candidates on their own, according to a person familiar with the matter. <U+201C>Let me be clear to avoid any confusion, in ALL political campaigns, the firm always remains neutral and does not take sides,<U+201D> he said in the memo, according to the person. Word of the memo was first reported by the New York Observer. Mr. Giuliani<U+2019>s support of Mr. Trump wasn<U+2019>t always a given. Speaking with The Wall Street Journal when he first joined Greenberg in January from Texas-based law firm Bracewell LLP, previously known as Bracewell & Giuliani LLP, the former mayor said he was <U+201C>wrestling with who to support in the Republican primary.<U+201D> By April, he was still a tentative supporter, saying that while he planned to vote for Mr. Trump in the primary, he wasn<U+2019>t officially endorsing him . Since joining the 2,000-attorney firm, Mr. Giuliani has been a high-profile presence internally and on the speaking circuit, often touting the cybersecurity issues his legal practice has focused on of late. Just Wednesday, he gave the keynote address at an insurance-industry cyber liability summit in Manhattan. At the firm<U+2019>s annual St. Patrick<U+2019>s Day party, Mr. Giuliani donned his finest green duds and served as one of the event<U+2019>s grand marshals.

In this podcast, Andrew Rosenthal, a Times Op-Ed columnist, talks about the news <U+2014> the good, the bad and that which makes him mad. What is Andrew Rosenthal mad about this week? Donald J. Trump<U+2019>s rise, says Mr. Rosenthal, has provided a platform for some of the <U+201C>most appalling people in national politics,<U+201D> including Newt Gingrich (<U+201C>a narcissist, just like Trump, with a history of treating women badly<U+201D>) who made news this week when he took jabs at the Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly. <U+201C>With any luck,<U+201D> says Mr. Rosenthal, <U+201C>if Hillary Clinton is elected, we won<U+2019>t have to hear from Newt Gingrich again <U+2014> ever.<U+201D> Bad news of the week: Less than two weeks from the election, says Mr. Rosenthal, we are faced with all kinds of important issues we are not talking about; one of these is gun control, and Mr. Rosenthal has some thoughts about the issue and the Second Amendment. Last, the good news. It comes from Cleveland, where the Indians, a team that has not won a series since 1948, played against the Chicago Cubs, which has not won since 1908. In a blast of poesy, Mr. Rosenthal, quoting his wife, Mary Beth, reflects on the contest of underdogs that is this year<U+2019>s World Series, and pronounces baseball a game that is <U+201C>all about heart.<U+201D> Plus, says Mr. Rosenthal, <U+201C>it<U+2019>s an American game, a great series, and it is not about the election.<U+201D> Susan Lehman is host.",

        "original_post": "The Obama Administration on Monday suspended the latest round of talks with Moscow over the Syrian civil war. Russian strongman Vladimir Putin has responded by suspending a plutonium-control agreement and dispatching a sophisticated anti-air system to Syria. News of the new military shipment comes from three U.S. officials who spoke with Fox News, which reports that the SA-23 Gladiator arrived in the region over the weekend at Russia<U+2019>s naval base at Tartus, on the Mediterranean. This is the first time Moscow has deployed the SA-23 to Syria. The SA-23 system could impose significant restrictions on U.S. military action in Syria, since it can target cruise and ballistic missiles as well as aircraft. U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has proposed creating no-fly zones in Syria to deter the Bashar Assad regime<U+2019>s murderous bombing runs, and her opponent, Donald Trump, has vowed to escalate the war on Islamic State. Mr. Putin has now dialed up the risk quotient associated with either course of action. The bigger concern may be Russia<U+2019>s growing military clout in the Middle East. The SA-23 deployment follows Russia<U+2019>s transfer of a similar system to its clients in Tehran, its firing of cruise missiles from the Caspian Sea and its use of an Iranian air base earlier this year to launch sorties against Syrian opposition targets. The Obama Administration and its media allies dismiss these developments as swaggering by a second-rate power, or as signs that Mr. Putin is being trapped in an Arab quagmire of his own making. But the Russian understands that he is creating military facts on the ground that increase the leverage of his allies in any future talks. The leaders in Israel, Turkey and the Gulf States will no doubt appreciate the shifting balance of power the deployment reflects. There is a war on. Russia<U+2019>s side is winning, and the allies of America and the rest of Europe are losing.",

        "original_post": "In the week after Donald Trump <U+2019>s U.S. election victory, investors pulled more cash out of<U+00A0>U.S.<U+00A0>fixed-income funds than at any time over the last three years,<U+00A0>in one early sign that the recent bond selloff may have legs. Big selloffs in bond markets often go hand in hand with investors taking money out of mutual funds. This can create a vicious cycle, whereby selling begets more selling. Investors withdrew<U+00A0>$8.2 billion<U+00A0>from<U+00A0>U.S.<U+00A0>bond funds in the week ending Nov. 16, according to data<U+00A0>provider<U+00A0>EPFR Global. That is the largest weekly outflow since June 2013 at the height of the so-called Taper Tantrum , when the Federal Reserve raised the prospect of slowing its bond purchases and sent Treasurys tumbling. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory last Tuesday has increased expectations of fiscal stimulus and inflation, both of which are bad for bonds. Government bonds were on the move again Friday, after a volatile period. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was<U+00A0>2.327%, up from 2.278% Thursday and 1.867% on the day of the election. Yields have spiked across the developed world as investors sell bonds from<U+00A0>Australia<U+00A0>to Britain. <U+201C>We may not be at the start of a 35-year bear market for bonds, but it feels as though we<U+2019>re at some kind of inflection point,<U+201D> said John Stopford, head of multiasset income at Investec Asset Management. <U+201C>We would expect a move similar to the Taper Tantrum of 2013,<U+201D> he added. Investors pulled a net $36 billion out of U.S. bond funds between late May and early September 2013 during the so-called<U+00A0>Taper Tantrum, according to EPFR Global. Over that period, 10-year Treasury yields climbed by around a percentage point in the space of a few months. Yields rise as prices fall. Sudden moves in the bond markets have encouraged investors to quickly pull money before. In the spring of 2015, money exited European bond funds as the German government bond market led a selloff in global fixed income. Investors pulled a net $15 billion from European bond funds in the 12 weeks following the start of that selloff. Still, investors may not read too much into only one week of flow data. There are also good reasons why the bond selloff could peter out. Many economists believe the global glut in savings should keep yields depressed. In Europe and Japan, where there are negative interest rates, pension funds and insurance companies remain hungry for yield. It is also not clear how much of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s policy agenda will get enacted. Any backtracking on fiscal stimulus, for instance, could send yields back down again.<U+00A0>Increased spending typically increases the supply of bonds. But as long as money is draining from bond funds, investors will continue to be cautious. <U+201C>People just step back,<U+201D> said Jub Hurren, a credit fund manager at Aviva Investors, referring to periods of stress like the Taper Tantrum. <U+201C>No one wants to stand in the way of the move higher<U+201D> in yields, said Mr. Hurren.

        "original_post": "Republicans appeared to retain control of the New York state Senate in Tuesday<U+2019>s elections, but Democrats accused the GOP of declaring victory too soon and signaled the chamber could still turn Democratic. With results in all but two of the Senate races declared, the GOP emerged with 30 seats, with a Democrat, Sen. Simcha Felder, who caucuses with Republicans, giving them the 31. GOP Sen. Carl Marcellino of Long Island appeared poised to retain his seat, which would give the Republicans control of 32 seats. A Massapequa-area face-off between Democrat John Brooks and Republican Sen. Michael Venditto remained uncalled on Wednesday. On Long Island, Republican Elaine Phillips beat Democrat Adam Haber, 52% to 48%. But Democrats held on to another Nassau County seat: Sen. Todd Kaminsky, a former federal prosecutor, defeated GOP challenger Chris McGrath, 52% to 47%. <U+201C>We have grown our majority,<U+201D> Senate GOP spokesman Scott Reif said. Still, a spokesman for the Senate Democrats, Mike Murphy, said on Wednesday that the conference expected Mr. Venditto to win his race and for Democrat James Gaughran to pick up a seat in a race against Mr. Marcellino. The GOP <U+201C>took a premature victory lap and at the end of the counting we will have more Democrats in the chamber than Republicans,<U+201D> Mr. Murphy said. For the first time in several years, Democrats were within reach of taking the reins of the 63-person Senate from the GOP, but an 11th-hour addition to a breakaway faction of Democrats hurt those chances. And the coattails of a surprising presidential victory by Republican Donald Trump perhaps spelled a disappointing evening for down-ballot Democrats in New York. It remained unclear how the so-called Independent Democratic Conference, a five-member group that has aligned itself in a power-sharing agreement with Republicans, would position itself in the next legislative session, though chances that the group would realign itself with Democrats are slim. Earlier in the week, the group picked up another member, Sen. Jesse Hamilton, a Brooklyn Democrat. The group is also expected to pick up a seventh addition, Marisol Alcantara, a Democrat who won her race to succeed outgoing Sen. Adriano Espaillat.

This year, sensing Democrats could end up in command of the chamber, Mr. Cuomo endorsed and held events for several candidates, including Messrs. Kaminsky and Haber.

        "original_post": "Hillary Clinton <U+2019>s campaign accuses Vladimir Putin of interfering in America<U+2019>s election by supposedly supporting Donald Trump. But Australians have a well-founded complaint about one of the Democratic nominee<U+2019>s key advisers. Campaign chairman John Podesta helped coordinate a green lobbying and lawfare campaign to stifle the Australian coal industry, emails released by WikiLeaks show. Australian greens are fighting a new A$16 billion ($12.24 billion) mine in Queensland that would supply coal to Indian power plants and create 10,000 jobs. The federal government and Labor Party-controlled state government approved the project with more than 200 environmental conditions. But the Sunshine Project and other groups continue to file nuisance lawsuits to block it. Tax-exempt charities can accept foreign money under Australian law but they can<U+2019>t lobby the government. In this case the U.S.-based Sandler Foundation, part of the anticoal coalition led by Mr. Podesta, contributed to the Sunrise campaign against the mine that clearly constituted lobbying. In emails to Mr. Podesta, Sunrise<U+2019>s John Hepburn seeks ideas on how to retain its charitable status and avoid disclosing its funding to a parliamentary committee. The emails spell out how Sunrise gave financial support and scholarships to indigenous groups to block the mine. Australian politicians are furious. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull condemned these <U+201C>very systematic, very well-funded campaigns against major projects.<U+201D> Resources Minister Matt Canavan said the greens <U+201C>seek to subvert our legal system for political ends.<U+201D> The government is considering legislation to restrict charities from bringing lawsuits. New Delhi and the company backing the mine, Adani Group , are also upset. Power Minister Piyush Goyal says the delays <U+2018><U+2019>will certainly dampen future investments<U+2019><U+2019> in Australia. Without the Queensland mine, India will have to import lower-grade coal from Indonesia and elsewhere, leading to more pollution. The Institute of Public Affairs in Sydney released a report last month that found 87% of the lawsuits that green groups bring under the Environmental Protection Act fail. Yet they cause delays that cost Australia up to A$1.2 billion annually. The global anticoal campaign supported by Mr. Podesta has so far succeeded in stopping the Queensland mine. But its use of deception and foreign money could spark a backlash. In one email, Mr. Hepburn told his foreign supporters that, <U+201C>Without your support none of this would have happened.<U+201D> Then he mocked those who claim <U+201C>there is some kind of foreign-funded and tightly orchestrated conspiracy to systemically destroy the Australian coal industry,<U+201D> ending with a self-congratulatory joke: <U+201C>I seriously don<U+2019>t know where they get these wacky ideas from.<U+201D> Australians aren<U+2019>t amused.",

        "original_post": "OTTAWA<U+2014>Canadian officials have produced <U+201C>limited results<U+201D> in bolstering border security and accelerating cross-border trade in the five years since a landmark agreement between Ottawa and Washington, a Canadian government watchdog says. The findings from Canada<U+2019>s auditor general , released Tuesday, come after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump promised in his election campaign to focus on border security and better trade terms from Canada and Mexico, who are signatories to the North American Free-Trade Agreement. The report from Auditor General Michael Ferguson, whose role is roughly equivalent to that of the U.S. Government Accountability Office, evaluated the results of the Canadian government<U+2019>s Beyond the Border initiative. Former Prime Minister Stephen Harper and President Barack Obama endorsed the broad plan in 2011 to integrate North American security efforts and accelerate the flow of trade across the border. Implementing the promises carried a price tag for Canada of 1.1 billion Canadian dollars ($819.7 million). The border plan included, for instance, a beefed-up entry-exit verification system and an integrated cargo-security program, in which goods would be inspected at the first point of arrival in North America and be given pre-clearance for travel across the border. Canada<U+2019>s efforts to date have produced <U+201C>limited results<U+201D> and faced significant delays, Mr. Ferguson said in his report. Government departments and agencies involved <U+201C>cannot show Canadians how these measures have significantly enhanced border security or accelerated travel and trade,<U+201D> he said. Canadian officials said they agreed with the report<U+2019>s findings and recommendations. <U+201C>We are taking action to address them,<U+201D> said Ralph Goodale, Canada<U+2019>s minister of public safety. Uncertainty among Canadian firms is at elevated levels, partly because people are waiting to see what policy measures Mr. Trump might want to enact to fulfill his promises. This has increased expectations among Canadian market watchers about another rate cut from the Bank of Canada. The auditor issued eight recommendations on improving efforts to bolster trade and security. A representative from the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa did not immediately respond for a request for comment. At the time that Beyond the Border plan was rolled out, Canadian firms applauded the agreement. Exporters believed it could help ease bottlenecks and compliance burdens that delayed and thwarted the shipment of goods across the border following the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001.

        "original_post": "The dollar touched a 13-year high Wednesday, powered by rising U.S. bond yields and expectations of ramped up fiscal stimulus under the incoming presidential administration. The ICE Dollar Index, which gauges the U.S. currency against a basket of six others, rose to 100.57 earlier in the session, its highest level since April 2003. Rising government bond yields in the U.S. have driven up the dollar against currencies such as the euro, where yields remain close to historic lows. The euro recently was down 0.4% at $1.0681, its lowest level since December 2015. With Republicans in control of the House and Senate, some investors also believe that President-elect Donald Trump will have an easier time pushing forward policies that would stimulate the U.S. economy and boost the dollar further. <U+201C>Now that we have a new administration on the way, the dollar<U+2019>s rally has received a fresh dose of octane,<U+201D> said Joe Manimbo, an analyst at Western Union. Federal-funds futures, used to bet on central-bank policy, on Wednesday showed that investors assigned a 90.6% likelihood that the Federal Reserve will increase rates in December. Higher rates tend to boost the dollar by making it more attractive to yield-seeking investors. Some investors believe that accelerating growth will spark inflation, forcing the Fed to raise rates at a faster clip next year, Mr. Manimbo said. The bump in U.S. yields has also sucked money out of emerging markets, as investors shift money out of the comparatively risky currencies of developing countries into Treasurys. Emerging-market currencies also have been hurt by fears that the protectionist policies supported by Mr. Trump could hurt the economies of countries that export heavily to the U.S. The dollar recently was up 1.1% at 3.3255 against the Turkish lira, a record high. It rose 0.5% against the Russian ruble to 64.77, and gained 1.3% against the South African rand, to 14.37. <U+201C>Investors with a long-term horizon are advised to wait until further depreciation offers attractive entry points for bullish emerging market exposure,<U+201D> analysts at Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale said in a report. The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which gauges the U.S. currency against 16 currencies, was up as high as 90.90, its strongest level since February.

        "original_post": "Amid the selloff in Asian and European stocks Wednesday, one sector was notably buoyant: defense. Shares in BAE Systems, the U.K.<U+2019>s largest arms supplier, and French defense-electronics firm Thales were up 3% in midmorning trading. At first glance the reaction seems odd, particularly for BAE. The U.S. accounted for 38% of the company<U+2019>s revenues last year, and the Department of Defense three-fifths of that. Given Donald Trump<U+2019>s populist and evidently popular wish to bring jobs home, investors might expect sales to come under pressure. Investors have instead focused on two alternative policies sketched by Mr. Trump during this year<U+2019>s campaign . First, he has made the classic Republican commitment to increase military spending, which may offset a preference for U.S. contractors. More important, the president-to-be has combined attacks on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that underpinned European security during the Cold War with overtures to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a potentially radical subversion of previous U.S. policy. If Europe can no longer count on American military support to contain simmering problems on the Russian borderlands and in the Middle East, it will have to increase its own spending. Or in a more benign scenario, Mr. Trump succeeds where others have failed, by holding more NATO members to commitments to spend 2% of output on defense. Asia also betrayed nervousness . During the campaign, Mr. Trump talked of making Japan and South Korea carry more of the regional defense burden. Japanese defense stocks Tokyo Keiki , which makes electronics for jet fighters, and Ishikawa Seisakusho, which manufactures naval mines, leapt 18% and 14% respectively in afternoon trading Wednesday. Shares in Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd. , a major Korean contractor, rose 1.9% against a 2.3% fall in the wider market. A Trump victory has made the world feel a little less secure.

Delving into a field dominated by men, Ms. Hennessee initially did hedge-fund research at Wall Street firms E.F. Hutton Group Inc. and Republic New York Securities Corp. In the mid-1990s, she became an independent researcher. Along with her husband, Charles Gradante, she built up Hennessee Group LLC, which advised wealthy people on fund choices. That business created trouble for them when one of the fund managers they recommended, Bayou Management LLC, collapsed in 2005. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint saying Hennessee Group failed to respond to red flags and didn<U+2019>t vet Bayou<U+2019>s accounting firm. Hennessee Group didn<U+2019>t confirm or deny the allegations but agreed to pay $814,644 in disgorgement and fines.

        "original_post": "CHICAGO<U+2014>A Catholic high school cancelled classes Friday as tensions grew following a fatal police shooting that sparked competing protests and racially charged texts by students. The unrest began with the Saturday shooting of a 25-year-old black man by a white off-duty Chicago police sergeant in the predominantly white neighborhood of Mount Greenwood on the city<U+2019>s South Side. After protesters came to the neighborhood Sunday, a string of texts by several female Marist High School students upset with the demonstrators<U+2019> presence were shared widely on social media, adding to tensions in the enclave of mostly Irish- and Italian-American city workers. On Saturday night, Joshua Beal was fatally shot by the police sergeant after an altercation with an off-duty Chicago firefighter. According to an initial statement from Chicago police, the sergeant came across the fight and saw that Mr. Beal had a gun in his hand. A screenshot from a private cellphone video of the incident authenticated by police shows that Mr. Beal was armed. In its statement, the Chicago police said the sergeant stopped and exited his vehicle before displaying his weapon and announcing himself, but after Mr. Beal <U+201C>failed to drop his weapon, shots were fired.<U+201D> The sergeant is on administrative leave while the incident is investigated, police said. Mr. Beal<U+2019>s family, which couldn<U+2019>t immediately be reached for comment, has disputed the police account. Activists from Black Lives Matter and other groups came to visit with the family, but the demonstrators were met by competing protesters. Sunday, the Marist students exchanged texts that referred to the protesters with racial slurs. The school said it was taking disciplinary action against the girls. A faction of Black Lives Matter had planned a Friday protest but canceled their plan after receiving threatening messages. <U+201C>This town has the largest amount of Trump supporters in my city and I<U+2019>m scared for my people,<U+201D> said Yahaira Tarr, an activist with the group and co-organizer of the canceled protest.

The University of Michigan said Friday its preliminary reading of consumer sentiment rose to 91.6 this month from October<U+2019>s final reading of 87.2 . Last month<U+2019>s reading matched September 2015 as the lowest reading of the past two years. The survey for the preliminary November reading occurred between Oct. 27 and Tuesday, Election Day. November<U+2019>s final reading, scheduled for Nov. 23, will include both pre- and postelection interviews. The latest reading was well above the 88.0 figure economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected. <U+201C>These moves can presumably be explained by the solid pace of employment growth and the continued low level of gasoline prices,<U+201D> said Andrew Hunter, economist at Capital Economics. But <U+201C>the shock victory of Donald Trump means that the final estimate of confidence reported later this month could be much lower, not least because Hillary Clinton appears to have narrowly won the popular vote.<U+201D> The survey found consumers also raised their expectations for future inflation. Consumer expectations for both short-term and longer-term annual inflation rose to 2.7% in the early November reading from October<U+2019>s record-matching low of 2.4%. Measures of consumer inflation have trended at historically low levels, missing the Federal Reserve<U+2019>s 2% inflation target for more than four years. Expectations for firmer inflation could support Fed policy makers looking to increase the central bank<U+2019>s short-term interest rate next month. <U+201C>The most striking finding in early November was that both near and long-term inflation expectations jumped,<U+201D> said the survey<U+2019>s chief economist Richard Curtin. <U+201C>These increases must be replicated before they can be taken to indicate a troublesome development; thus far, the data has simply repeated the March 2016 peaks.<U+201D> The survey<U+2019>s reading of current economic conditions improved to 105.9 from October<U+2019>s final reading of 103.2. The reading of future expectations rose to 82.5 from 76.8. Write to Eric Morath at eric.morath@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Donald Trump <U+2019>s U.S. election victory has shattered assumptions in global markets. The potential change from monetary to fiscal stimulus and from free trade to reversing globalization upends nearly every belief held by investors. In reaction, investors are betting the result is a jump in inflation. The biggest change though may be a return of divergence in global economic growth and the policies that drive it. Bond markets were already providing a window into these shifts . But Mr. Trump<U+2019>s move to the White House make them impossible to ignore. Steeper yield curves<U+2014>the gap between U.S. two and 10-year yields has vaulted to its widest since January<U+2014>and higher yields are likely here to stay. For the first half of this year, global economic policy was surprisingly consistent . Interest rates in developed markets were stuck at or near zero because any time there was an expectation of tightening, currencies rose, pushing down inflation expectations. Fiscal policy was being talked about, but few believed much would really happen. In markets, global yields converged<U+2014>particularly on a currency-hedged basis, where U.S. 10-year yields adjusted for the cost of hedging into euros and yen fell to zero. That has reversed, notes J.P. Morgan Asset Management. In the U.S., the shift reflects big expectations for potentially higher growth and higher inflation. That puts the expected U.S. policy mix at one end of the spectrum: looser fiscal policy and potentially tighter monetary policy if inflation picks up. In the U.K., the shift is all about inflation for now thanks to the collapse in the pound as uncertainty persists about what Brexit will do to underlying growth. It isn<U+2019>t clear that the U.K. has the political or fiscal space to open the fiscal taps. That means U.K. monetary policy stays loose for now, but may not get looser. In the eurozone, the rise in yields is mostly due to rising rates overseas, and threatens still fragile growth. A key worry is the widening in yield spreads against Germany for countries like Italy and Portugal. The need for fiscal policy to pick up the slack from increasingly ineffective monetary policy has been talked about forever, but the currency bloc<U+2019>s rules make a big switch hard to contemplate. Japan, meanwhile, is at the other end of the spectrum. The Bank of Japan <U+2019>s shift to targeting the yield curve means the country could get loose monetary and fiscal policy in concert. A good deal of policy uncertainty lies ahead: markets may be overreacting now. But that still argues for higher yields to reflect rising risks after a period where global central banks were all singing the same market-friendly melody and governments were more passive. It is time to throw out old assumptions. Write to Richard Barley at richard.barley@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "The Food and Drug Administration backed off its plans to issue broad rules governing thousands of laboratory tests produced by hospitals and private companies, according to key members of Congress. The FDA had planned to issue a set of standards, known as a guidance, that would set out how it would regulate what are known as <U+201C>lab-developed tests.<U+201D> There are thousands of them<U+2014>estimates range as high as 60,000<U+2014>and they largely aren<U+2019>t subject to federal regulation. The FDA and the Obama administration had planned to change that in the next several weeks, according to a source familiar with those activities. But with a new administration and President-elect Donald Trump about to take office, the agency has altered course. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.), chairman of the Senate committee overseeing health issues, and Rep. Fred Upton (R., Mich.), who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said they were informed the agency no longer intends to issue a final guidance that would cover those tests. Mr. Alexander, who has been skeptical about the agency<U+2019>s plans as too restrictive on the laboratory industry, said he is glad <U+201C>the agency has listened and will delay making final its current draft guidance.<U+201D> He said the FDA <U+201C>will work with Congress and the new administration on next steps.<U+201D> Mr. Upton said the decision was <U+201C>the right call.<U+201D> <U+201C>We appreciate FDA<U+2019>s decision to refrain from finalizing its guidance<U+201D> on the tests, he said. An FDA spokesman said only that patients and health-care providers <U+201C>need accurate, reliable and clinically valid tests<U+201D> and that it would <U+201C>continue to work with stakeholders, our new administration and Congress to get our approach right.<U+201D> <U+201C>We plan to outline our view of an appropriate risk-based approach in the near future,<U+201D> the statement said. The agency didn<U+2019>t detail its next steps. The laboratory industry objected to the FDA plans from the moment the draft version was made public two years ago. At issue are tests that are made and used entirely within hospitals and laboratories to screen tissue, cell and other samples sent by doctors, with results sent back to the doctors. These tests are distinct from the more traditional laboratory business, in which companies sell diagnostic machines and test kits for use across the U.S. The FDA has regarded lab-developed tests as the Wild West of medicine and has cited examples of inaccurate tests that it says have put patients at risk. Those who produce those tests say their methods are accurate and lifesaving, and that FDA regulation would get in the way of producing the most sophisticated assays, such as genetic analyses of diseases like cancer. The agency has previously said it has found problems with certain tests for heart disease, ovarian cancer, Lyme disease, whooping cough and autism. It has said many of the tests produced and used solely within hospitals and other labs don<U+2019>t go through the same meticulous controlled studies as do traditional test kits. Write to Thomas M.

        "original_post": "The Trump trade has been buy stocks and sell bonds. That has sent stocks to new highs, and put bonds in the midst of their worst selloff since the financial crisis. Investors have caught on and flows into mutual and exchange-traded funds have experienced a violent shift. The problem is, investors have been so focused on bonds, they have missed years of great returns in stocks. Domestic stock funds, which have had steady outflows since the start of last year, had inflows of $30.1 billion over the two weeks that ended Nov. 23, the Investment Company Institute reported Wednesday. Bond funds, which investors loved until the election, had outflows of $11.4 billion. The reversal in itself isn<U+2019>t all that strange, since investors tend to chase performance. But what is odd, says Richard Bernstein of Richard Bernstein Advisors, is that they have been turning up their noses at stocks for so long. For most of the time since the financial crisis, stocks have beaten bonds, though investors continued to buy fixed income. The largest U.S. stock fund, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, returned 13.4% annually over the five years that ended in October. Over the same period, the biggest U.S. bond fund, the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund, returned 2.7% annually. Investors stuck with bonds because they were still smarting over their losses in 2008 and 2009. While the declines are nowhere near as severe for bonds, the BofA Merrill Lynch U.S. Aggregate Bond Total Return Index had its worst month since the crisis, falling 2.2% in November. Stocks posted strong returns even when many investors were selling. They could keep rallying, driven by stimulus-driven growth, or stall just as investors start buying.

        "original_post": "Greek shipping magnate John Angelicoussis expects President-elect Donald Trump to generate new business for the ailing shipping industry through infrastructure spending and increased energy production. <U+201C>There is no question that he is going to be positive for shipping in terms of infrastructure expansion. The U.S. needs a hell of a lot of infrastructure,<U+201D> Mr. Angelicoussis told The Wall Street Journal in a rare interview. Mr. Angelicoussis has three separate companies operating a fleet of 133 supertankers, dry bulk vessels and liquefied-natural-gas carriers, worth around $6.9, billion, the world<U+2019>s sixth largest in terms of value, according to maritime data provider VesselsValue. Most of the ships are chartered to oil and commodity majors including Exxon Mobil Corp. , BHP Billiton Ltd. and Cargill Corp. The billionaire has been the top buyer of dry bulk vessels over the past year and also splashed $1 billion for eight crude oil and LNG tankers in June. Mr. Trump has vowed to pump billions into projects to upgrade U.S. infrastructure. But his pledge to tear up global trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership could cause pain for shipping industry at a time when global trade is forecast to grow by just 1.7% this year, marking the slowest pace since the 2008 financial crisis, according the World Trade Organization. Mr. Angelicoussis hopes Mr. Trump won<U+2019>t engage in a trade war with China. <U+201C>Shipping lives off China,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>There will be no winners in a trade war. We should leave them alone and continue to trade.<U+201D> Since Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election, the Baltic Dry Index, a measure of the cost to ship raw materials like cement, copper and iron ore, has risen steadily, closing Thursday at a 23-month high. Mr. Angelicoussis said Mr. Trump<U+2019>s promise to boost oil drilling and tackle export regulations will benefit his tanker business with ships bringing in heavy fuel for the U.S. market and shipping out lighter fuel to export markets. <U+201C>There will be far more activity in oil and gas,<U+201D> he said. Mr. Angelicoussis said he expects the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to reach an agreement to cut production at their Nov. 30 meeting. <U+201C>Brent is low at around $46 [per barrel] because most expect no agreement,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>But I think there will be one because OPEC needs it. A price of $50 to $60 is good for the Arabs because they can make money, but not overdo it.<U+201D> At that price he predicts China and India will continue building their oil reserves, saying China wants to double its 250 million barrels and India seeks to substantially boost its 100 million barrels in reserve.

Vermont has a claim on being the most liberal state in the nation <U+2013> home to Bernie Sanders and Howard Dean and the site of President Obama<U+2019>s largest 2012 victory outside of his native Hawaii. And yet Vermont<U+2019>s blueness is recent. In every presidential election from the 1854 founding of the Republican Party through 1960, Vermont voted Republican. On the flip side, today<U+2019>s solidly Republican Deep South never voted Republican for much of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As recently as 1988, West Virginia was one of the nation<U+2019>s 10 most Democratic states. The point is, politics can change more radically and rapidly than we often assume. This year<U+2019>s titanic struggle of an election, in particular, could accelerate change. White voters without a four-year college degree are becoming increasingly Republican, as my colleague Nate Cohn and others have noted. Everyone else <U+2013> whites with a bachelor<U+2019>s degree and non-whites <U+2013> is becoming more Democratic. FiveThirtyEight published a fascinating map on Wednesday highlighting the places where these trends may matter most. In the simplest terms, Donald Trump may fare better in the Northeast and industrial Midwest than other recent Republican nominees, while Hillary Clinton may do better in the deep South, the Southwest and the Great Plains. It<U+2019>s possible that Pennsylvania will change from blue to purple in coming years and that Iowa and Ohio will switch from purple to red. (Already, the Clinton campaign is treating Ohio and Iowa as nice-to-have rather than must-have.) At the same time, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Florida could become bluer. On net, these trends favor the Democrats. Their groups <U+2013> non-whites and college graduates <U+2013> are growing. But there are also risks for the Democrats. The country still has a lot of whites without a college degree, and the Democrats have actually won support from many of them who live outside of the South in recent elections. If the party writes off these voters <U+2013> viewing them, to use Clinton<U+2019>s distasteful word, as <U+201C> irredeemable <U+201D> <U+2013> it will struggle to hold the House or Senate and to accomplish its goals for the country. The odiousness of Trump<U+2019>s campaign should not trick the Democrats into making that mistake. You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook .

        "original_post": "Donald Trump <U+2019>s recorded vulgarities about women come as independent and female voters had already been moving away from his candidacy, polling shows, suggesting he has a steep challenge in shoring up support among those large voter groups. Independent voters and suburban women, groups that aren<U+2019>t firmly attached to either party, held among the most negative views of Mr. Trump of any blocs in the electorate, even before a recording surfaced late Friday of Mr. Trump boasting in 2005 about his star power enabling him to grope women. Mr. Trump is viewed more unfavorably by voters overall than any major-party nominee in modern history, but views among independent voters and suburban women were particularly negative in Wall Street Journal\/NBC News polling last month, as were the opinions of undecided voters. Now, Mr. Trump faces the problem of having to rebuild his image among voting groups that are already predisposed to view him unfavorably and which are moving toward his rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton. Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s lead among women jumped by 15 percentage points between September and October in Quinnipiac surveys of likely voters. Her advantage among independents rose by 7 points in the course of that month. Fox News surveys found Mr. Trump leading among independents this month, but with a margin that fell by 10 percentage points since September. The trend has showed up in polls of battleground states, as well. In Pennsylvania and Florida, for example, several surveys show independents moving toward Mrs. Clinton and her lead among women holding stable or growing slightly over the past month. The two voter groups are important parts of the electorate. Women vote in greater numbers than men, accounting for 53% of voters in 2012. Because the presidential voter pool usually has more Democrats than Republicans, GOP candidates often need a big lead among independents to make up the difference. In 2012, President Barack Obama and GOP nominee Mitt Romney each drew the same share of their own party<U+2019>s voters, above 90%. But the larger number of Democrats helped give Mr. Obama the victory, even though Mr. Romney carried independent voters by 5 percentage points. In Pennsylvania, where most polls show Mrs. Clinton with a significant lead, a Franklin & Marshall College survey released this week found her advantage growing by 7 percentage points among independents over the prior month, and her lead growing by a slight 2 percentage points among women. In Florida, a highly competitive battleground, Quinnipiac surveys found Mr. Trump<U+2019>s lead among independent voters narrowing by 6 percentage points between September and October, with the support of women staying stable. Some 61% of registered voters had a negative view of Mr. Trump in Wall Street Journal\/NBC News polling last month, compared with 52% who had a negative view of Mrs. Clinton. Negative views of Mr. Trump outweighed positive views by 33 percentage points. But among suburban women and independents, negative views outweighed positive ones by 39 points and 36 points, respectively, suggesting that Mr. Trump<U+2019>s task in reframing his image among those voters will be all the harder.",

        "original_post": "Donald Trump <U+2019>s election victory is giving U.S. investors firsthand experience in what an uncertainty shock feels like. The danger is that they may be feeling it for a while. Stocks had a wild ride Wednesday as investors grappled with the reality of a Trump presidency, falling sharply in the early hours, paring losses to open in the green, and then moving sharply higher. Shares of companies in areas that Mr. Trump has said he would target, such as those with heavy exposure to trade with Mexico, did particularly poorly. Shares of companies that might see a lighter regulatory touch with Republicans controlling the White House and both chambers of Congress, such as biotechs, shot higher. Treasurys, typically the beneficiary of haven flows during times of market turmoil, fell instead . That reflects a thicket of concerns, all of which would be bad for bonds. Heightened geopolitical risks and rising trade barriers would be inflationary. Indeed, 10-year inflation expectations embedded in Treasury-inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, rose to 1.82% from 1.73% Tuesday. Further hurting bonds: The possibility of higher deficits, to say nothing of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s suggestion in the spring that if the economy <U+201C>crashed<U+201D> he would pay U.S. creditors less than what they owed could boost interest rates. What makes the situation particularly perilous for markets is that investors have little more than a lightly sketched-out idea of what Mr. Trump will do as president, or what kind of president he will be. His campaign is thin on the policy plans that presidential candidates typically put together and it isn<U+2019>t clear whether he will be the populist he campaigned as or if he will pivot to become a more pragmatic deal-maker. This creates a situation where investors are unsure of where they should put their money. Until they get a better sense of how Mr. Trump will govern, that is a situation that may persist<U+2014>a recipe for further market volatility. Compounding the problem, investors also need to reckon on how the uncertainty they are feeling will feed into the real economy. Businesses, too, may delay investment plans until they have more clarity on Mr. Trump. Any potential softening in the economy could be reversed if Mr. Trump and Congress quickly work out a tax-cut and spending plan. That is likely to happen<U+2014>early success boosting the economy will be the priority of the Trump presidency.<U+00A0>The risk is that the plan doesn<U+2019>t work as planned due to the weight of political uncertainties such as Mr. Trump<U+2019>s restrictions on trade or immigration. And the Federal Reserve, with little in the way of remaining conventional monetary firepower, may not be able to lend much help. Since it began seven years ago, the resiliency of the U.S. economic recovery has been repeatedly challenged. It is about to face its toughest test yet.

        "original_post": "Donald Trump spent a busy weekend meeting potential cabinet picks, including such admirable school reformers as Michelle Rhee and Betsy DeVos and longtime economic opportunity crusader Bob Woodson. We hope amid all the other decisions that someone is also moving fast to name a replacement for Antonin Scalia <U+2019>s seat on the Supreme Court. Apart from the national-security and Treasury jobs, the next Justice may be the most important to move on quickly. While Mr. Trump won<U+2019>t be inaugurated until Jan. 20, the new Congress convenes in the first week of January. With the continuity from the current to the new Senate, the GOP-led Judiciary Committee could begin vetting Mr. Trump<U+2019>s nominee as soon as it gets the name. A vote could take place soon after the President-elect is sworn in and can formally submit the nomination. While the Supreme Court can function with eight Justices, there<U+2019>s good reason Mr. Trump should want a ninth Justice soon. Numerous cases challenging the Obama Administration<U+2019>s dubious rule-makings are moving through the federal courts, which President Obama has moved sharply left over eight years. The circuit courts of appeal might be inclined to rubber stamp those regulations, which means they would become law in those circuits unless the Supreme Court takes the cases. A 4-4 High Court ruling means the lower-court decision stands. Knowing a new Supreme Court is ready for review could give some lower-court judges pause before they issue rulings likely to be overturned. An early nomination could also get ahead of the game if Mr. Trump<U+2019>s choice runs into confirmation trouble. The political left will throw everything it has to defeat the next nominee, and the GOP<U+2019>s Senate majority will only be 51 or 52 (the race in Louisiana will be decided next month in a runoff). Mr. Trump released a list of 21 potential nominees during the campaign (we<U+2019>d add appellate judges Jeff Sutton and Brett Kavanaugh to the list), and the White House ought to have them vetted and ready to take off like planes at O<U+2019>Hare.",

        "original_post": "Metal prices rallied Monday, despite a strengthening dollar, as a pledge by China<U+2019>s president to support a free-trade area in the Asia-Pacific boosted optimism about Chinese demand. Typically, a strong dollar weighs on metal prices because it makes sales to China and other emerging markets more expensive. But positive sentiment around China along with hopes that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will boost infrastructure spending pushed prices higher. Three-month copper futures on the London Metal Exchange rose 2.5% to $5,560 a ton, zinc gained 2.1% to $2,596.5 a ton and nickel was up 3.2% to $11,165 a ton. <U+201C>Normally a higher dollar value is not good for commodity prices, but this time around it is different because dollar strength is on account of hopes of U.S. economy getting better,<U+201D> says Helen Lau, analyst with Argonaut Research. <U+201C>Now that is good for commodities consumption.<U+201D> Hopes of freer trade flows and the prospect of more imports by China, the world<U+2019>s largest consumer of metals, buoyed investor sentiment, Ms. Lau said. In a speech to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Lima, Peru, on Saturday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said his government would support a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific and was pushing forward with the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a trade pact that includes 16 countries. China, the world<U+2019>s second-biggest economy after the U.S., could take on a greater role in global trade if Mr. Trump<U+2019>s administration pulls out of U.S.-led accords, analysts say. In the next five years, China will import $8 trillion of goods and invest $750 billion abroad, Mr. Xi said. In the lead-up to the U.S. presidential election, Mr. Trump vowed to review trade pacts and impose across-the-board tariffs on imports from China, a large exporter of metals to the U.S. <U+201C>Of course, I think there is a certain element of uncertainty going forward, especially as we are not sure about the policies of the U.S. president-elect,<U+201D> said Ms. Lau. Metal prices have zigzagged over the past two to three weeks. Most base metal prices, including copper, zinc, aluminum, nickel and lead, tumbled when it became clear that Mr. Trump was headed to a surprise victory because traders were unclear about his policy positions. Those price moves later reversed course. Analysts expect metal prices to be volatile in the near term. If the U.S. Federal Reserve raises rates next month, the rally in metals prices would likely be capped by dollar strength. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election coincides with a global metals glut. In recent months, Chinese metal producers have added to the oversupply by stepping up output, which has partly been supported by a pickup in China<U+2019>s housing market and infrastructure spending. Chinese cities have recently taken measures to curb speculation in the property market. <U+201C>The Chinese construction sector is likely to experience headwinds because of restrictions that are now being imposed, though overall the investment climate [in the nation] appears to be far more stable,<U+201D> said Eugen Weinberg, head of commodities research at Commerzbank.

        "original_post": "News that Donald Trump claimed a $916 million net operating loss on 1995 state tax returns has led to speculation that he could have wiped out his tax liabilities for more than 15 years. Net operating loss carry-overs are legal behavior and have long been a feature of the tax code. Here are some basics: Q. Where did the concept originate to allow certain losses to be carried over to other tax years? A. The Revenue Act of 1918 introduced the idea of allowing taxpayers to carry over net-operating losses, known as NOL, to other tax years, temporarily allowing for an NOL to be carried back one year and then forward one year. Today, carry-over periods reach 20 years; losses can be carried back two years. Q. What<U+2019>s the idea behind it? A. Allowing businesses to carry forward (and carry back) loss helps them better weather the economy<U+2019>s inevitable ups and downs, advocates argue. It lets businesses and their owners smooth out their incomes and tax bills over multiple years, giving them a better chance at long-term survival. Some economists argue that the carry-over also can help counteract economic downturns. Q. Who tends to use it the most? A. Cyclical businesses that can suffer heavy losses in downturns, such as consumer-goods makers. Owners of real-estate investment firms, with big interest and depreciation deductions, also can benefit. Other rules benefit real-estate investors such as Donald Trump, including the ability to use losses to offset other kinds of income. Q. Do taxpayers ever claim losses that didn<U+2019>t exist? A. Because the NOL carry-over is a potentially lucrative break, it has occasionally led people to concoct schemes aimed at generating big NOL<U+2019>s on paper that they then use to claim big refunds of prior-year taxes. Q. How controversial has this provision been in Congress? A. There has been debate, but the basic principle of business NOL carry-over has been embraced and expanded in recent years by both parties. Q. Is there any push now to take this away, or modify it? A. Progressives often criticize the NOL break as a giveaway to business, but there has been little serious effort in Congress to take it away. Some states have reduced the benefits of the NOL break, principally for budget reasons, and often state rules aren't as generous as the federal rules. Write to John D.

        "original_post": "Donald Trump prevailed in Utah on Tuesday, overcoming ambivalence about the GOP nominee from many Mormons, who make up the majority of the state<U+2019>s population. With 36% of the votes tallied, Mr. Trump won 51% of the state<U+2014>defeating Hillary Clinton, and Evan McMullin an independent candidate who ran on a conservatism platform. The Associated Press called the race for Mr. Trump. Mr. McMullin came in second, with 23.5% of the vote. Mrs. Clinton garnered 20%. Mr. McMullin, a Mormon and former House Republican staffer, made Utah an unlikely swing state , with polls in late October showing him running close with<U+2014>or even ahead of<U+2014>Mr. Trump. Republican elected officials in Utah, including Gov. Gary Herbert and Rep. Jason Chaffetz, also distanced themselves from Mr. Trump in October, though Mr. Chaffetz later backtracked and said he would vote for the GOP nominee. Many Utah voters ultimately did the same, despite their reservations about his character. Rebecca Farnsworth, a 52-year-old resident of Sandy, Utah and a Mormon, said Mr. Trump was <U+201C>not a very upstanding guy. He<U+2019>s not honest. He<U+2019>s kind of a playboy.<U+201D> Still, she voted for him. <U+201C>I thought he<U+2019>d appoint Supreme Court justices<U+2014>that was my only reason,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>I knew a vote for a third party was basically a vote for Hillary Clinton, so I tossed that idea out the window. I wanted to be smart.<U+201D> Speaking to supporters on election night, Mr. McMullin called on his voters to help build <U+201C>a new conservative movement.<U+201D> If Mr. Trump wins the election, Mr. McMullin said in his concession speech, <U+201C>the Republican Party can no longer be considered the home for conservatives.<U+201D> Conservatism, he said, was about protecting <U+201C>fundamental rights,<U+201D> adding, <U+201C>tonight there are millions of Americans, I<U+2019>m sad to say, who are in fear that perhaps their liberties will be challenged and threatened under a Trump administration that has made a campaign of targeting people based on their race, their religion and gender.<U+201D> Gov. Gary Herbert, who coasted to re-election on Tuesday, said in a phone interview Tuesday night that he wasn't surprised Mr. Trump had carried the state, though he would likely win a far lower portion of the vote than Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee in 2012, who carried more than 70% of the Utah vote. <U+201C>I think it<U+2019>s because of his policies, in spite of the personal foibles and lack of some decency and character that really is a turnoff for the people of Utah,<U+201D> Gov.

        "original_post": "Some good news from Tuesday, a point of sanity on a day when the nation<U+2019>s electoral judgment went catastrophically astray: Voters in Maricopa County, Ariz., sent Sheriff Joe Arpaio packing . He lost his bid for a seventh term. After 24 years, <U+201C>America<U+2019>s Toughest Sheriff<U+201D> is done. Non-Arizonans might know the 84-year-old sheriff from news accounts and TV, mostly Fox, where he poses as a national expert on immigration and inmate humiliation. He<U+2019>s the lawman who makes jail inmates wear pink underwear and live in a scorching desert tent and eat only two meals a day, because whatever criminals deserve, it isn<U+2019>t dignity. You may also know him as a chief instigator of the <U+201C>birther<U+201D> movement, having dispatched his <U+201C>cold-case posse<U+201D> to Honolulu to track down the supposedly forged Obama birth certificate. Donald Trump has backed away from birtherism, but Sheriff Arpaio evidently has not. He told Tea Party die-hards as recently as September that he was still on the case . Sheriff Arpaio and Mr. Trump are longtime mutual admirers; the sheriff spoke at the Republican convention, hailing the nominee and attacking immigrants, to whoops from the law-and-order crowd. Law and order is not what Sheriff Arpaio is about. Immigrant advocates, civil-rights organizations and reporters in Arizona have spent years screaming into the wind about this, trying to alert the world that this celebrity peace officer does not, in fact, keep the peace. On the contrary: He abuses his power to mistreat inmates, to terrorize law-abiding Latinos, to harass and intimidate his critics and political adversaries. His misdeeds have cost the county tens of millions of dollars, forcing it to raise property taxes to pay for legal expenses. The subject of repeated lawsuits and federal investigations, Sheriff Arpaio has stridently denounced his critics and boasted that he answered to no one but the voters and himself. The law caught up with him, sort of, before the voters did. The federal judge in a long-running racial-profiling lawsuit ruled in 2013 that Sheriff Arpaio had violated Latinos<U+2019> civil rights, and later held him in civil contempt of court, for ignoring his order to stop racially profiling Latinos. In October the sheriff was charged with criminal contempt . In a re-election ad, he denounced the charges as politically motivated <U+201C>garbage<U+201D> from the Obama Justice Department. But Arizona voters <U+2014> who gave the sheriff<U+2019>s challenger, Paul Penzone, 55 percent of the vote <U+2014> knew better. Who knows what Sheriff Arpaio will do next? He should certainly be disqualified for any job in the next administration, especially if it involves immigration. If there is a list of nightmare scenarios somewhere, Joe Arpaio as homeland security chief would certainly be in the Top 100.

        "original_post": "NEW HAVEN, Conn.<U+2014>Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said Tuesday he would oppose any action by President-elect Donald Trump that would bar Muslim refugees from coming to his state. Mr. Malloy has made accepting Syrian refugees a priority for his administration . Some 339 Syrian refugees have settled in Connecticut in 2016, according to the U.S. State Department. <U+201C>I would fight any attempt to limit refugees being given status based on religion,<U+201D> Mr. Malloy, a Democrat, said. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m hopeful that the rhetoric from the campaign will give way to a sensible approach to honoring our long-term international commitments.<U+201D> The Trump transition team didn<U+2019>t respond to a request for comment. Mr. Malloy made his comments at an event at the Jewish Community Center of Greater New Haven where Syrian families also spoke. One Syrian refugee, who lives in New Haven with his pregnant wife and six children, said he is grateful for the chance to build a home in the U.S. He and his family arrived in Connecticut three months ago and he is now taking English classes. The refugee said he is familiar with Mr. Trump<U+2019>s statements and but so far isn<U+2019>t too concerned for his family. <U+201C>I feel comfortable,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>People didn<U+2019>t change their behavior toward us<U+201D> after the election. Karen Foster, assistant refugee resettlement coordinator for Danbury Area Refugee Assistance, a nonprofit organization, recently began helping Syrian families in Connecticut. <U+201C>We have spoken to them about the election<U+2026>to let them know that they are safe,<U+201D> Ms. Foster said. <U+201C>They can<U+2019>t be sent back. They are legal here. They are legal residents and they are authorized to work.<U+201D> During his remarks, Mr. Malloy also revisited a public spat that he had in 2015 with Mike Pence, then governor of Indiana and now the vice president-elect. Following the terrorist attacks in Paris last fall, several governors across the U.S. said they would no longer accept Syrian refugees. Mr. Malloy, however, said Connecticut would continue to welcome them. Mr. Pence opposed a plan to relocate a family to Indiana, and that family was diverted to Connecticut. Mr. Malloy later greeted the family when they came to New Haven. <U+201C>I<U+2019>m sure if Vice President-elect Pence was here today, he would tell you what he did in Indiana was a mistake,<U+201D> Mr. Malloy said. The Trump transition team didn<U+2019>t respond to a request for comment on Mr. Malloy<U+2019>s remark. Mr. Malloy also said <U+201C>it would be a tragic mistake<U+201D> if Mr. Trump opts to start a registry for immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries. <U+201C>The idea that we would require any Jew, any Christian, any Buddhist, any Muslim to be on a list based on their religion is a direct conflict with the Constitution of the United States,<U+201D> Mr. Malloy said.

        "original_post": "At least three cities reported acts of vandalism Thursday and a dozen people were arrested in Richmond, Va., after protests against the election of Donald Trump as president. Three Confederate statues in Richmond were sprayed with graffiti after hundreds of people marched Wednesday night, authorities said. The crowd blocked the streets near Virginia Commonwealth University. Online video showed marchers chanting, <U+201C>No Trump. No KKK. No fascist USA,<U+201D> and carrying banners reading, <U+201C>Not my president.<U+201D> Troopers responded to Interstate 95 around 10 p.m. and guided a large group of protesters off the highway, state police said. More than an hour later, troopers were called to the Downtown Expressway, where protesters sat in lanes and many refused to leave. Around midnight, troopers arrested four men and six women between the ages of 20 and 26 and charged them with unlawful assembly and being pedestrians on an interstate, according to the statement. Richmond police arrested two more people on the opposite side of the road who will face the same charges, the department said. No arrests had been made in connection with the damage to statues along the city<U+2019>s Monument Avenue, which authorities believe were tagged during the protests. <U+201C>Your vote was a hate crime<U+201D> was painted on a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Also tagged were statues of Confederate General Robert E. Lee and naval officer and oceanographer Matthew Fontaine Maury. The statues were being cleaned Thursday. The headquarters of the Republican Party of Virginia was also vandalized during the protest, chairman John Whitbeck said in a statement. TV station WWBT reported the doorbell was broken and graffiti was painted on the building. A police spokeswoman said no one had filed a report about the vandalism. In New Orleans, windows were broken at a downtown building and anti-Trump slogans were spray-painted on some structures, including the base of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, during a march involving several dozen people Wednesday night. In Raleigh, N.C., banners on the front of the North Carolina Republican Party headquarters, including one celebrating Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory, were shredded. Thousands of people protested the president-elect across the nation on Wednesday night , even though many supporters of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton were appalled last month when Mr. Trump suggested during the campaign that he might not accept the election results if he lost. Scattered protests continued Thursday, with hundreds marching in Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York and Grand Rapids, Mich. In New York, a large group of demonstrators gathered for a second night outside Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, chanting angry slogans and waving signs reading <U+201C>Not My President<U+201D> and <U+201C>Divided States of America.<U+201D> Police said dozens of the protesters were arrested Wednesday. About 500 people turned out in Louisville, Ky., chanting and carrying signs as they marched downtown. <U+2014>Copyright 2016 the Associated Press",

The economy, the Supreme Court and foreign policy are the other topics on the list, according to the commission. The debate will be held at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas next week. The format calls for a 15-minute segment for each of the six topics, for 90 minutes total and no commercial breaks. The first presidential debate between the nominees, on Sept. 26 in New York, also called for six 15-minute segments. The second debate, held this past Sunday, was a town-hall format. The debate next Wednesday figures to be Mr. Trump<U+2019>s final opportunity to make a dent in Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s lead in front of a big television audience. The Democrat<U+2019>s lead in national polls has been growing. Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com",

Mr. Trump<U+2019>s choices for the State Department, Commerce Department and other top jobs will shed light on the incoming administration<U+2019>s priorities and policies toward the rest of the world. Meanwhile, pre- and post-election data will continue to roll in. U.S. markets will get a respite on Thursday for Thanksgiving. MONDAY-WEDNESDAY: With Mr. Trump warning China about possible tariffs , the relationship between the world<U+2019>s two biggest economies will be on display this week at a set of Washington meetings. Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang and other high-level officials are scheduled to meet in the U.S. capital in connection with the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade. WEDNESDAY: A gauge of activity in the eurozone<U+2019>s manufacturing and services sectors is expected to point to a slightly faster pace of economic growth during the final quarter than in the three months through September, although not fast enough to convince the European Central Bank that it needn<U+2019>t extend its program of bond purchases. Economists expect the composite purchasing managers index to edge up to 53.4 in November from 53.3 in October. In the U.K., the government will present new plans for tax and spending , its first fiscal response to the U.K.<U+2019>s June vote to leave the European Union. Economists expect a small increase in spending on infrastructure, with a slight lowering of forecast growth leaving Treasury chief Philip Hammond little room to splurge given the still wide budget deficit. The University of Michigan<U+2019>s consumer sentiment index will offer an early glimpse of economic confidence through the election period. A preliminary reading, out Nov. 11 and which only captured the pre-election mood, rose to 91.6 from October<U+2019>s two-year low of 87.2. The numbers out Wednesday also will reflect postelection sentiment. Economists expect the headline to hold steady at 91.6, which would indicate a fairly healthy outlook heading into the holiday season. Federal Reserve officials at their Nov. 1-2 meeting held their benchmark interest rate steady . Minutes from the session will offer details on policy makers<U+2019> thinking as the next gathering, set for Dec. 13-14, nears. Indications suggest they are poised to raise rates for the first time since December 2015. FRIDAY: U.S. exports surged in the third quarter of the year, boosting gross domestic product. But economists think a one-time surge in soybean exports was behind much of the gain. October<U+2019>s look at U.S. trade in goods will show if exports have reverted to more sustainable levels while also shedding light on demand for consumer, industrial and agricultural goods at home and abroad.",

Carl Martin Welcker said that the trend, if left unchecked, would undermine the international competitiveness of businesses in Europe<U+2019>s largest economy. Mr. Welcker, the managing director of machine-tool maker Schuette GmbH, is slated to be elected as president of Germany<U+2019>s VDMA industry group on Friday. The VDMA represents almost 3,200 German engineering firms. <U+201C>A series of massive increases in negotiated wages is hurting us badly,<U+201D> he said. In Germany, pay terms are often negotiated for an entire industry. Taking aim at Berlin ahead of general elections next fall, Mr. Welcker said productivity has been hurt by a <U+201C>growing catalog of demands<U+201D> on businesses, including complex requirements for factory lighting and recycling as well as equal-opportunity employment. Economists point to data supporting Mr. Welcker<U+2019>s complaints. The Cologne Institute for Economic Research recently calculated that personnel costs in Germany<U+2019>s manufacturing industry<U+2014>including wages and contributions to social insurance, pensions and health insurance<U+2014>have risen about 10% over the last four years, making Germany one of the world<U+2019>s most expensive production locations. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s a concern, especially in light of weak productivity gains in Germany,<U+201D> said Christoph Schroeder, an economist at the institute. Unit labor costs in German manufacturing, which take account of different levels of productivity, are now on average one-third higher than in the U.S. and 10% higher than in Spain, Mr. Schroeder said. <U+201C>We need more of the U.S. system, which does not try and dictate the tiniest of details,<U+201D> said Mr. Welcker. He made his comments before Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, in part on promises to reduce business regulation. Many economists say measures introduced in Germany over the last three years by Chancellor Angela Merkel <U+2019>s government have increased labor-market regulations. The measures include a statutory minimum wage, a new law easing retirement at age 63 and a tightening of collective-bargaining rules. Write to Nina Adam at nina.adam@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "An unusual decision by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. contributed to huge trading volumes when stock markets opened Wednesday. The firm <U+201C>front-loaded<U+201D> an unusually large proportion of client orders, two people familiar with the situation said. The people said Goldman injected an abnormally large amount of client orders into the opening auction at 9:30 a.m. Exchange run such auctions each morning to rectify imbalances between buy and sell orders that come in overnight and determine the opening price of each stock. Goldman<U+2019>s move involved a tweak to its volume-weighted average price, or VWAP, algorithm. Banks often use such algorithms to get their clients the best price for large stock trades. The process involves breaking up big orders into batches and executing them throughout the day, timing the trades so more of them are fired off at times of greater trading volume. That helps minimize the impact of each trade on the stock<U+2019>s price. Normally Goldman would execute less than 10% of its client order flow in opening auctions, but in the wake of Donald Trump<U+2019>s surprise election victory it adjusted its algorithm to do around 25% at the open, one of the people said. The bank told its clients <U+201C>we have a Special Volume Profile today (in other words, a <U+2018>front-loaded VWAP<U+2019> curve for our algos) due to the anticipated heightened liquidity around the open,<U+201D> in a note reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Trump<U+2019>s unexpected win caused stock-market futures to plunge overnight before a dramatic reversal when markets opened Wednesday. The S&P 500 seesawed wildly in the first two hours of trading and then ended the day with a gain of 1.1%. The New York Stock Exchange said 81 million shares were traded at the open on Wednesday, compared with the daily average in October of 35 million.

        "original_post": "Peter Berkowitz, a senior fellow at Stanford<U+2019>s Hoover Institution, writing Wednesday at RealClearPolitics.com: After the voters elect the 45th president of the United States next week, a portentous question will remain: Why did the Republican nominee<U+2019>s larger-than-life defects trigger a civil war among conservatives, while progressives<U+2014>especially elite progressives<U+2014>fell into line and rallied around a Democratic nominee whose policy blunders, hypocrisy, and proclivity to lie to the American people to cover up cronyism and lawlessness have been amply documented? . . . <U+201C>The Demon in Democracy: Totalitarian Temptations in Free Societies<U+201D> might seem an unlikely source of insight into the deep forces driving American electoral politics. Nevertheless, Ryszard Legutko <U+2019>s erudite polemic analyzing the resemblances that liberal democracy in the West bears to the Soviet communism it vanquished clarifies the roots of progressive unity in America and the causes of conservative discord. Legutko<U+2019>s brilliant book suggests that progressives and left-liberals unite more effectively because they are in harmony with contemporary liberal democracy<U+2019>s liberationist and egalitarian drift<U+2014>in other words, its tendency to dismantle inherited authorities and pursue equality of result. By contrast, conservatives find much of what they cherish under assault by government<U+2019>s relentless expansion into areas<U+2014>such as family, faith, and speech<U+2014>that were once commonly held to be largely beyond state supervision. . . . Progressives<U+2014>especially progressive elites<U+2014>can come together in support of Hillary Clinton because of their confidence that for all her baggage she shares their liberationist and egalitarian understanding of liberal democracy and will fortify their grip on the commanding heights of politics and culture. Donald Trump is not the cause but a symptom of division and disarray among conservatives, who have been rattled and thrown on the defensive by a culture and governing institutions that have taken the other side in a partisan battle over the future of freedom.",

        "original_post": "Food is food, but investors in companies that serve it at restaurants are viewing the election of Donald Trump differently than those who invest in businesses that package and sell it to supermarkets. The restaurant industry<U+2019>s lobbying group said it expects President-elect Trump to lift regulations it says have stifled growth and to spur spending. <U+201C>I think Trump<U+2019>s win will be great for the economy. I think we<U+2019>ll see real GDP [gross domestic product] growth and that will be great for the restaurant and retail industry,<U+201D> said Andy Puzder, chief executive of CKE Restaurants Inc., the privately held parent company of Carl<U+2019>s Jr. and Hardee<U+2019>s, in an interview. Several restaurant chains, including The Cheesecake Factory , Bravo Brio Restaurant Group Inc. and Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants Inc., had sizable share gains in midday trading Wednesday. But shares in global packaged food and beverage companies including Mondelez International Inc., Kellogg Co. and PepsiCo Inc. fell as analysts warned of implications on global trade. Analysts say Mr. Trump could impose trade restrictions with countries such as Mexico and China, given comments he made opposing the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. <U+201C>Potential duties on imports from Mexico could affect several companies,<U+201D> notes Susquehanna analyst Pablo Zuanic. <U+201C>Over the years a number of companies built plants in Mexico to supply their U.S. needs,<U+201D> including Mondelez and Hershey Co. Mondelez, the maker of Oreo cookies, was specifically criticized by Mr. Trump for building a $130 million factory in Mexico that allowed it to close a Chicago plant and eliminate 600 U.S. jobs. The Illinois-based company argues it has also invested $450 million in upgrading U.S. factories since 2012. All food makers will likely welcome any looser regulations after years of grappling with rules on everything from what they should tell consumers about where meat is sourced to labeling food made with genetically modified organisms, or GMOs. Mr. Trump has supported the biotechnology industry, and farmers and experts say he is unlikely to impose further rules governing the use or labeling of GMOs <U+2014>a benefit to food makers who feel such labels vilify science that helps lower the cost of food. The Grocery Manufacturers Association said in a statement it is hoping for the Trump administration to support <U+201C>science-based law, regulations and policies,<U+201D> around food. Meanwhile, restaurants are likely cheering the possibility Mr. Trump won<U+2019>t increase the federal minimum wage, analysts say, even if they still face state and local minimum wage increases. The National Restaurant Association, in a report it posted after the presidential race was called, said: <U+201C>We may see relief in some of the burdensome requirements imposed on businesses and employees alike in the health care space, as well as in labor regulations (looking at you, Overtime Rule),<U+201D> referring to a pending Labor Department rule that would raise the salary threshold for workers eligible to receive overtime pay.

The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against 16 others, was recently up 0.2% to 89.61, its highest closing since March. Investors have driven the dollar to eight-month highs this week amid optimism that fiscal spending and tax cuts under a Trump administration will spur economic growth, higher inflation and lighter regulation. Expectations for higher U.S. interest rates have also climbed, as investors bet resurgent growth will allow the Federal Reserve to tighten borrowing costs. Fed-funds futures, a tool traders use to place bets on central-bank policy, show an 81% chance of an interest-rate increase next month, up from 71.5% on Thursday, according to CME Group data. The dollar<U+2019>s strength is pressuring emerging-market currencies and bonds. As U.S. interest-rates rise, emerging markets become less attractive to yield-seeking investors.

        "original_post": "U.S. banks may be eating Europeans<U+2019> lunch, but it isn<U+2019>t all good news for them. These days any growth in balance sheet or global reach risks aggravating perceptions that banks are too big to fail. That means higher capital charges as three U.S. banks and one Chinese lender have found after the latest assessment by the Financial Stability Board, the global body responsible for systemic risk. The changes make sense but they could sour the trans-Atlantic debate on regulation when U.S. lenders already see European peers in general as undercapitalized. Those deemed more risky are Citigroup (which has become one of the two most systemically important banks in the world alongside J.P. Morgan Chase), Bank of America , Wells Fargo and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China . Meanwhile, Barclays and Morgan Stanley have had their charges cut, as has HSBC, which previously occupied the top slot with J.P. Morgan. The point of these charges is to make taxpayer bailouts less likely<U+2014>a higher capital charge should give the riskiest banks more of a cushion again losses. The FSB, made up of the world<U+2019>s leading regulators, sets the charges annually, though they don<U+2019>t come fully into force until 2019. Many regulators use the FSB<U+2019>s standards, but the U.S. Federal Reserve has taken a harsher view of systemic risk and is imposing higher charges on its biggest banks . J.P. Morgan, for example, faces the steepest charge for systemic risk in the U.S., which will add 3.5 percentage points to its common equity Tier 1 capital ratio requirements in 2019. That is much bigger than the 2.5 percentage point charge set by the FSB. The same is true for other U.S. banks, even after the increases announced Monday for Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. For Barclays and HSBC, meanwhile, the cut in charges is a real benefit. For both, it will free up half a percentage point of capital, supporting future dividends. Both banks have shrunk and simplified their balance sheets in the past year. But most interesting is how these changes might influence the regulation debate. Global rule makers have come in for sharp criticism from European regulators and politicians for threatening higher capital requirements on European banks as charges for mortgages and corporate loans look likely to be increased . The German regulator last week said it would walk away from global rules if the changes went ahead. In the U.S., President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to dismantle some postcrisis regulations. The worry here is that global cooperation on banking regulation could now turn into global conflict. Regulators have to be careful that ending too big to fail isn<U+2019>t the first casualty.

Mr. Ricketts, who previously worked for his billionaire family<U+2019>s financial firms and has more recently managed his family<U+2019>s political spending, will serve under Wilbur Ross Jr. , whom Trump said he had chosen to serve as commerce secretary . Mr. Ross, a billionaire businessman, was also a top fundraiser for Mr. Trump during the campaign. In a statement, Mr. Trump called Mr. Ricketts an <U+201C>immensely successful businessman<U+201D> and praised his family<U+2019>s management of the Chicago Cubs as <U+201C>one perfect step after another.<U+201D> Mr. Ricketts<U+2019>s father, Joe, is the founder of TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. The family purchased the Cubs in 2009. Earlier this month, the team won Major League Baseball<U+2019>s World Series for the first time since 1908. Mr. Ricketts, in a statement released by the campaign, said he would focus on <U+201C>advancing practical policies that promote economic opportunity,<U+201D> and said he was <U+201C>honored<U+201D> to have been chosen. His selection marks the latest addition of a wealthy fundraiser to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s cabinet. Also Wednesday, Mr. Trump confirmed he had chosen Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker who headed his campaign fundraising effort, as Treasury secretary. Last week, he announced he had chosen billionaire Betsy DeVos to serve as secretary of education . And earlier this month, he filled his transition team executive committee with top donors, including Rebekah Mercer and Peter Thiel. Mr. Ricketts<U+2019>s family had a complicated relationship with Mr. Trump during the campaign, and their late rally behind the businessman was one of the more remarkable reversals of the 2016 campaign. Mr. Ricketts<U+2019>s parents, Joe and Marlene, initially supported Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, and the family donated millions to a super PAC working on his behalf. Even after Mr. Walker dropped out of the race, the Rickettses funded some of the most aggressive ads against Mr. Trump of the election season. One advertisement featured women repeating the harsh ways with which Mr. Trump has referred to women, including <U+201C>dog<U+201D> and <U+201C>fat pig.<U+201D> When Mr. Trump learned in February that the Ricketts family was behind some of the attacks on him, he sent a tweet saying: <U+201C>I hear the Rickets [sic] family, who own the Chicago Cubs, are secretly spending $<U+2019>s against me. They better be careful, they have a lot to hide!<U+201D> Tom Ricketts, Todd<U+2019>s brother and the chairman of the Cubs, responded: <U+201C>It<U+2019>s a little surreal when Donald Trump threatens your mom.<U+201D> Months later, in late September, The Wall Street Journal reported that Joe Ricketts planned to spend at least $1 million airing ads attacking Hillary Clinton in battleground states. Billionaire casino owner Sheldon Adelson was also behind the effort. Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at rebecca.ballhaus@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "New York City Councilman Joe Borelli, one of two city lawmakers to endorse Donald Trump , is seeking an appointment in the president-elect<U+2019>s administration, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Borelli, a Staten Island Republican who was first elected to the council last year and re-elected this month, is said to be interested in serving as a deputy ambassador to the United Nations, or possibly the ambassador to France, these people said. He speaks French. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump didn<U+2019>t immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Borelli, 34 years old, served as co-chairman of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign in New York and has become a frequent surrogate for the president-elect on cable TV news shows. His endorsement of Mr. Trump, a Republican, earned him scorn and sometimes open mockery from his colleagues in the overwhelmingly liberal council, where he serves as one of three Republicans in the 51-member body. Since Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election, Mr. Borelli has found himself in an unusual role. Last week, for example, Mr. Borelli said he helped broker a phone call that led to a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat whom the president-elect had described as <U+201C>the worst mayor in the U.S.<U+201D> A spokesman for Mr. de Blasio said the councilman was one of several people who provided points of contact with Mr. Trump<U+2019>s inner circle. Mr. Borelli served as a state assemblyman for nearly three years before joining the council. He previously served as chief of staff to former City Councilman Vincent Ignizio, a Staten Island Republican. He teaches political science classes at the College of Staten Island. Since Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory, Mr. Borelli said his colleagues have stopped making jokes about Mr. Trump. <U+201C>I was that mopey Republican,<U+201D> Mr. Borelli said. <U+201C>Now basically everyone<U+2019>s coming up to me saying, <U+2018>How do I get on TV?<U+2019><U+201D> Write to Mara Gay at mara.gay@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "MUMBAI<U+2014>The Indian rupee hurtled toward an all-time low Thursday as the dollar rallied against a basket of currencies and investors continued to pull money out of Indian securities. One dollar bought 68.74 rupees in late afternoon trade in India, versus 68.80 in August 2013, the rupee<U+2019>s weakest level, according to data from Thomson Reuters. Global investors have yanked money from emerging markets, including India, since Donald Trump was elected U.S. president earlier this month, as they expect the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates at a faster clip. Higher rates make U.S. assets more attractive. Foreign institutional investors have pulled $3.7 billion out of Indian stocks and bonds so far in November. The rupee has fallen around 3% since the U.S. elections. Indian stocks have followed the rupee lower. The S&P BSE Sensex has fallen nearly 6% since the elections. It declined 0.74% Thursday to close at 25,860.17 while the National Stock Exchange<U+2019>s Nifty 50 fell 0.84% to 7,965.50. The pullout of investments has been exacerbated in India as Prime Minister Narendra Modi <U+2019>s move to replace the country<U+2019>s highest denomination notes sent bond yields lower. Since the announcement, Indians have rushed to exchange or deposit their currency at banks. Lenders are using that cash to buy bonds, which has pushed up prices and sent yields, which move inversely to prices, lower. The low yields are prompting foreign investors to sell their Indian bonds. <U+201C>India has dropped sharply<U+2026>because our interest rates are coming down,<U+201D> said Anjana Kovoor, vice president of Mecklai Financial Services Pvt. Ltd., a currency advisory firm in Mumbai. As foreign investors continue to dump Indian bonds, the rupee could stay under pressure in the coming weeks. Ms. Kovoor said the central bank likely stepped in during afternoon trading Thursday to keep the rupee from breaching its all-time closing low. On the Sensex, auto makers and private banks were among those that lost most value Thursday. Tata Motors Ltd. fell 3.9% while Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. fell 2.4%. Axis Bank Ltd. lost 2.6% and ICICI Bank was down 2%. Write to Shefali Anand at shefali.anand@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "First Mexico, now Turkey. Faced with a rapidly sliding currency in the wake of the U.S. presidential election, the Turkish central bank raised interest rates by more than expected Thursday. But Turkey<U+2019>s problems won<U+2019>t be solved by that. The lira bounced higher after the central bank<U+2019>s decision, which included a 0.5 percentage point rise in its benchmark one-week rate to 8%, but reversed course swiftly, hitting a record low. The currency stands at 3.42 to the dollar, down 15% this year and over 9% in November alone. The central bank said the move in the lira <U+201C>due to recently heightened global uncertainty and volatility<U+201D> threatened the inflation outlook. Rates had to rise even as the Turkish economy has slowed after July<U+2019>s failed coup. Donald Trump <U+2019>s election victory has raised fears about global trade; the stronger dollar and higher U.S. yields have sent a shudder through emerging markets. The increase, the Turkish central bank<U+2019>s first in nearly three years, was the right move, and showed the bank<U+2019>s independence. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has attacked high interest rates as a bad policy. But it seems unlikely to change the picture drastically. Further rate increases, risking a bigger clash with Mr. Erdogan, may be needed. The dollar<U+2019>s run stronger looks to have some momentum behind it. Even with a more hawkish central bank, Turkey is particularly vulnerable to an emerging-market chill. The coup attempt has led to a political crackdown on the military, civil service and media; the European Parliament Thursday approved a nonbinding resolution calling for a freeze on Turkey<U+2019>s accession talks with the European Union. That is layered upon pre-existing weaknesses including a sizable current-account deficit, forecast by the International Monetary Fund to hit 5.6% of gross domestic product in 2017. Turkey skated pasted financial-market trouble in the past thanks to loose global monetary policy and the search for yield. Those days look to be over.

(<U+201C>Can you put a little chocolate dusting on it?<U+201D> Mrs. Clinton asked.) And there was, at last, a slightly choppy bit of serenading, eventually finding its rhythm as Mrs. Clinton took the stage Wednesday inside a college gymnasium here. <U+201C>Thank you so much for singing to me,<U+201D> Mrs. Clinton said, before a halting on-message pivot to a down-ballot Democrat<U+2019>s cause. <U+201C>One of the best gifts you can give yourselves would be sending Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate!<U+201D> It was Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s birthday. And her campaign seemed disinclined to let anyone forget it. With a seemingly interminable campaign reaching the final sprint, it has been a week of at least occasional indulgences by the Clinton team, cresting perhaps on Tuesday night with an unscheduled stop from Mrs. Clinton at an Adele concert in Miami. On Wednesday morning, a spokesman, Nick Merrill, snapped a photograph of staff members surprising Mrs. Clinton, now 69, with a midmorning cake. (Though she appeared grateful in the image , Mr. Merrill said the candidate did not eat it right away. Hours later, she shared the cake with reporters on her plane, after having some herself.) The campaign also marked the occasion by creating a tool on its website allowing users to see some of what Mrs. Clinton has been doing in the years of their birth. <U+201C>The Birthday Chronicles,<U+201D> the site labeled it. A radio appearance, broadcast Wednesday but taped Monday for Power 105.1<U+2019>s <U+201C>Breakfast Club<U+201D> morning show, ended with a live rendition of <U+201C>Happy Birthday<U+201D> from Stevie Wonder. Before his performance, Mrs. Clinton asked Mr. Wonder, who also sang at a birthday-themed campaign fund-raiser on Monday, how many children he had. Nine, he said. <U+201C>And how many are of voting age right now?<U+201D> Five, Mr. Wonder said.

        "original_post": "Federal Reserve officials left their benchmark short-term interest rate unchanged at their meeting Nov. 1-2, but said the case for an increase had <U+201C>continued to strengthen.<U+201D> This suggested they could raise the federal-funds rate before year<U+2019>s end. Minutes of the gathering, which took place before Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8, will be released at 2 p.m. EST Wednesday. Here are some things to watch for. After the meeting, Fed officials said in a statement they would wait for <U+201C>some<U+201D> further evidence of continued progress on inflation and employment even as they said the case for lifting rates was stronger. The minutes could provide some clarity on what policy makers judge <U+201C>some<U+201D> further progress to be. They noted in the statement that inflation had increased somewhat since earlier in the year. The minutes will be parsed for insight into other reasons officials believed the case to move had strengthened. Officials didn<U+2019>t say in their statement whether they expected to move at their next meeting, Dec. 13-14. However, almost all the economists polled in a recent Wall Street Journal survey expected the Fed to raise rates next month. The minutes could reveal whether officials thought it likely they would move in December, and could offer other clues on when they might act. While Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen has consistently said politics play no role in setting monetary policy, officials at the meeting were well aware the U.S. presidential election was a week away. Any references to the election<U+2019>s potential impact on financial markets, the economy or regulation will be scrutinized. Ms. Yellen told Congress<U+2019>s Joint Economic Committee on Thursday that a rate increase <U+201C>could well become appropriate relatively soon ,<U+201D> provided the economic data hold up. The minutes could give more detail on policy makers<U+2019> assessments of the economy<U+2019>s health three weeks ago, and what they are hoping to see in the data to be released before their next meeting. The economic landscape has shifted since the Fed<U+2019>s last meeting. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory sent stocks, bond yields and the U.S. dollar higher and created new uncertainty about the policies to come out of Washington on taxes, government spending, health, trade, immigration and other issues. Also, economic data has been rosier since the last Fed gathering. Government reports on employment, retail sales and the housing market have depicted an economy gaining strength. So readers of the minutes should keep in mind that these developments won<U+2019>t be reflected in Wednesday<U+2019>s release. Write to Harriet Torry at harriet.torry@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Residents in Fargo, N.D., and a nearby county will be pooling their pennies for another 68 years<U+00A0>to help cover a massive, multibillion-dollar channel around the city to divert floodwaters from the Red River, despite opposition from neighboring counties and concern from officials in Minnesota. More than 60% of residents of Fargo and Cass County, which branches west of Fargo,<U+00A0>on Tuesday<U+00A0>voted yes on a proposal to extend three half-cent sales taxes to the year 2084 to pay for the Fargo-Moorhead area diversion project. The $2.2 billion project is meant to avoid the significant and costly floods of past years that have inundated the Fargo area.<U+00A0>With state and local funding in place, construction led by the Army Corps of Engineers is expected to break ground later this year. The multiyear project still needs to secure federal funding and a key permit from officials in Minnesota. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s better to have a plan talking about mitigation than it is to have no plan,<U+201D> said Tim Mahoney, mayor of the city of 118,000. The project would entail building a 36-mile long, 1,500-foot wide channel to divert flooding from the Red River,<U+00A0>which flows south to north. Initially the federal government had agreed to pay for half of the cost, but now it is going to pay for just $450 million of the total $2.2 billion. Mr. Mahoney said he is confident that the administration of President-elect Donald Trump will eventually <U+201C>cough up their part,<U+201D> both because Mr. Mahoney considers it a model infrastructure project, but also because North Dakota<U+2019>s congressional delegation supported Mr. Trump<U+2019>s candidacy. <U+201C>We think it<U+2019>s an innovative project, to show how the government can save money going forward on infrastructure projects, and of all the projects Trump might look at, we<U+2019>re one of the only ones ready,<U+201D> Mr. Mahoney said. But the project has faced stiff opposition from some communities south of Fargo,<U+00A0>including some in Minnesota, where a dam that is part of the project will hold back some of the water heading for Fargo, flooding areas that had not faced the problem in the past. <U+201C>They<U+2019>re taking water and pushing it from a flood plain to an area that has never flooded,<U+201D> said Nathan Berseth, a spokesman for the Richland-Wilkin Joint Powers Authority, which represents communities upstream from Fargo.<U+00A0>He said<U+00A0>he doesn<U+2019>t disagree with the need to protect residents and business from floods, but that <U+201C>we just think it<U+2019>s too far south and too large a project.<U+201D> The project was dealt a major setback last month when the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources rejected a permit application from Fargo, saying<U+00A0>the diversion is <U+201C>not the right way to achieve<U+201D> enhanced flood protection and <U+201C>the project cannot be permitted under Minnesota law.<U+201D> Mr. Mahoney says the initial application was <U+201C>incomplete,<U+201D> and that project proponents are in talks with Minnesota and will resubmit the application soon.

        "original_post": "A senior Russian parliamentarian announced Monday that Moscow would deploy short-range ballistic missiles as well as a sophisticated air defense system to Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave tucked between Poland and Lithuania. Think of this as Vladimir Putin <U+2019>s first test of Donald Trump <U+2019>s mettle as a Commander in Chief. <U+201C>Why are we reacting to NATO expansion so emotionally?<U+201D> Mr. Putin asked in an interview the same day. <U+201C>What should we do? We have, therefore, to take countermeasures, which means to target with our missile systems the facilities, that, in our opinion, start posing a threat to us.<U+201D> Those missile systems include the mobile Iskander system, which can carry a nuclear warhead to a range of 300 miles, along with the S-400 surface-to-air missile system, capable of shooting down all but the most sophisticated stealth planes. The <U+201C>facilities<U+201D> to which these missiles are supposedly a response are future sites for an advanced version of the American SM-3 anti-ballistic missile system, which<U+2014>unlike the Iskanders<U+2014>has no offensive purpose. It<U+2019>s worth recalling that as part of his <U+201C>Russian reset<U+201D> in 2009 President Obama cancelled a Bush Administration plan to deploy ABM systems to Poland and the Czech Republic to defend against Iranian missiles. The Kremlin<U+2019>s vociferous opposition succeeded in getting Mr. Obama to yield, and the Russian strongman may be wagering that he can play the same trick with President-elect Trump. But one reason the Obama Administration moved ahead with the SM-3 plan was years of Russian military provocation in Central and Eastern Europe. This includes its violations of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty, nuclear threats by Russian diplomats against European countries, provocative bomber forays near European airspace, the invasion of Ukraine, and Moscow<U+2019>s complete withdrawal last year from the 1992 Conventional Armed Forces in Europe treaty, which set ceilings on overall force levels for NATO and former Soviet states. Mr. Putin is playing the old Soviet game of behaving provocatively and then complaining of the <U+201C>provocative<U+201D> response. This has NATO allies such as Poland, which meets its treaty obligations of spending more than 2% of GDP on defense, justifiably nervous. Warsaw will be well within range of the Iskander missiles. Mr. Trump has indicated he wants a reset of his own with the Kremlin. That<U+2019>s a respectable goal, provided the President-elect pursues it not through Mr. Obama<U+2019>s habit of pre-emptive concessions, but with the tried-and-true formula of peace through strength. Completing the deployment of the SM-3s in Poland would send Mr. Putin the right message.",

He said it was up to Mr. Trump to explain to undecided voters why he <U+201C>thought that was acceptable behavior.<U+201D> Former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Mr. Trump had no intention of dropping out of the presidential race despite a rising chorus of Republican leaders calling on him to step aside. <U+201C>Gosh almighty, he who hasn<U+2019>t sinned throw the first stone here,<U+201D> Mr. Giuliani, a confidant of Mr. Trump, said on the CNN program, <U+201C>State of the Union.<U+201D> <U+201C>The fact is that men at times talk like that.

Mr. Giuliani stepped in at the last minute to substitute on the Sunday news programs for Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign manager, who initially was scheduled to represent the candidate.

        "original_post": "WUZHEN, China<U+2014>China<U+2019>s President Xi Jinping called for <U+201C>more fair and equitable<U+201D> governance of the global web, as the country opened a state-run internet conference aimed at pushing its alternative vision of the web. Mr. Xi said in video remarks played at the conference opening Wednesday that China would work to uphold <U+201C>cyber sovereignty,<U+201D> the idea that countries have absolute control over their corners of the internet. In its third year, the Wuzhen World Internet Conference remains an anomaly: a convocation of the world<U+2019>s biggest tech companies in a rustic tourist village, organized by the world<U+2019>s most sophisticated internet censorship bureau, the Cyberspace Administration of China. This year<U+2019>s conference comes after a sweeping new Chinese cybersecurity law that has drawn protests from U.S. trade groups. But U.S. tech companies are still at the conference in force, with executives from Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp. , International Business Machines Corp. , Intel Corp. , Tesla Motors Inc. and others listed as speakers this week, along with the CEOs of most of China<U+2019>s major technology firms. Still, this year<U+2019>s conference is smaller than last year<U+2019>s, perhaps a reflection of growing skepticism that the Chinese and U.S. visions will converge. U.S. social-media companies such as Facebook remain blocked across China. Unlike in the past two years, Wuzhen conference organizers didn<U+2019>t leave a hole in the Great Firewall for attendees to access the wider web. China<U+2019>s regulation of its internet grows tighter, as with the new law that requires security reviews for any information-technology equipment supporting critical sectors such as finance and transportation. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s campaign promises of high tariffs for Chinese imports has also raised uncertainty for trade between the countries. At the first Wuzhen conference in 2014, organizers slipped a note under guests<U+2019> hotel-room doors asking them to sign on to a declaration in support of China<U+2019>s principle of internet sovereignty. The declaration was scrapped after some foreign guests protested. Conference organizers have since gotten more subtle. But the panel topics this week still reflect China<U+2019>s view of the internet. The include counterterrorism; <U+201C>Internet Plus,<U+201D> Beijing<U+2019>s campaign to reboot traditional industries with internet-age technologies; and cross-strait internet development between China and Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing considers a renegade province. Still, Mr. Xi struck a diplomatic tone, saying China would work with the international community to <U+201C>bring about an open, inclusive and secure cyberspace<U+201D> with <U+201C>orderly development.<U+201D> <U+2014>Yang Jie contributed to this article.

        "original_post": "President-elect Donald Trump selected Betsy DeVos to be his secretary of education, putting a well-known Michigan philanthropist and school-choice advocate in charge of the agency tasked with promoting student achievement. Ms. DeVos, 58 years old, a former Michigan Republican Party chairwoman, would be the second woman named to join the Trump administration. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley was announced earlier on Wednesday as Mr. Trump<U+2019>s choice to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations . <U+201C>Together, we can work to make transformational change to ensure every student has the opportunity to fulfill his or her highest potential,<U+201D> Ms. DeVos wrote Wednesday on Twitter, adding that the <U+201C>status quo<U+201D> in education is <U+201C>not acceptable.<U+201D> The post is subject to Senate confirmation. She is chairwoman of American Federation for Children, a Washington-based group that advocates for the use of school vouchers and scholarship tax credit programs. Ms. DeVos<U+2019>s husband, Dick DeVos, was the Republican nominee for Michigan governor in 2006. The DeVos family, heirs to the Amway Corp. fortune, are major donors to Republican Party candidates and conservative causes. Ms. DeVos, a prominent charter-school advocate, would enter the office at a time when traditional public schools are fighting charter schools for students, as enrollment drives state and local funding. Some school districts, including the Los Angeles Unified School District, have reported losing thousands of students and millions of dollars. Charter schools, publicly funded campuses that are mostly privately run, are the fastest-growing educational option. Enrollment in charters rose 219% from 2004 to 2014 to more than 2.5 million students, while school-district enrollment dropped by 1%, according to an analysis of the latest data from the National Center for Education Statistics. Advocates for charters, which are usually not unionized, have often clashed with teachers unions. During the campaign , Mr. Trump frequently criticized the country<U+2019>s Common Core learning standards and said he would repeal them. The president doesn<U+2019>t have the power to do so because the standards were adopted by most states, and under current federal law choosing standards is a state decision. Ms. DeVos has been associated with education groups that backed Common Core, but on Wednesday she pointed to a statement on her website in which she said did not support it, adding that Common Core <U+201C>got turned into a federalized boondoggle. <U+201D> <U+2014>Tawnell D.

        "original_post": "A 37-foot-wide mansion on Riverside Drive on the Upper West Side has been on the market on and off for four years at prices as high as $40 million. Now the owner, facing a threat of foreclosure, is taking a new approach: putting it up for auction to the highest bidder. The auction is scheduled for Dec. 20 and the auction house, Concierge Auctions, estimates that it will sell for $13 million to $16 million. Auctions of one-of-a-kind properties have been on the rise because of the difficulty in efficiently establishing a fair price through conventional broker listings, especially during periods of uncertainty and market slowdowns, said Laura Brady, president of Concierge Auctions. The five-story, eight-bedroom house at 3 Riverside Drive sits on the prominent curved corner where the drive meets West 72nd Street at the southern edge of Riverside Park. Known as the Kleeberg Residence, the house was designed in the French Renaissance Revival style by the architect C.P.H. Gilbert and completed in 1898. The facade is faced with brick and limestone, and decorated with carved wreathes, ribbons, shields and gargoyles. When the current owner, Regina Kislin, a real-estate developer, bought the home for $2.64 million in 1996, it had been divided into apartments. Ms. Kislin and her husband, Anatoly Siyagine, a photographer, spend years restoring the home, which has been designated a landmark by the city. Now a single-family house with a marble foyer and staircase, coffered ceilings, a mahogany archway and a pool, it was listed for $40 million in 2012. The asking price was gradually cut in six stages to $18.5 million in October. Since 2013, Ms. Kislin has been facing a foreclosure action on a $4 million mortgage on the house. In court filings last year, Ms. Kislin<U+2019>s lawyers argued that the bank negotiated in bad faith, after reneging on an agreement that would have given her reduced payments for two years to give her time to sell the mansion. Jeffrey Dannenberg, a lawyer for Ms. Kislin, said she had been unable to sell the house because the <U+201C>super high-end market has just completely tanked.<U+201D> <U+201C>It is a beautiful property,<U+201D> he said, <U+201C>and she needs to move on with her life.<U+201D> Dexter Guerrieri, president of Vandenberg Inc.<U+2014>the Townhouse Experts, once had the listing for the house. Now he said he has two buyers planning to bid on it when it comes up for auction. <U+201C>It is as close as a Manhattanite can come to living in a European castle.<U+201D> he said. The property is one of 17 around the world scheduled for a live auction on Dec. 20 at the Trump SoHo New York in lower Manhattan. A preview of the Riverside Drive house is scheduled for Thursday between 5:30 p.m. and 8 p.m. Write to Josh Barbanel at josh.barbanel@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Warren Buffett may have made U.S. airline stocks great again , but across the Pacific Ocean another billionaire should keep Chinese carriers grounded: Donald Trump. The president-elect rose to power on a protectionist platform, threatening to slap a huge tariff on goods imported from China . Such policies would no doubt hurt airlines globally, and even before any trade war breaks out Mr. Trump<U+2019>s surprise victory has brought damage to carriers. Twin rises in interest rates and the U.S. dollar since Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election should bring immediate pain to Chinese airlines, weighed down with dollar-denominated debt but fueled by revenue in yuan. Take Air China , for example: Nearly 60% of its debt was in dollars as of June, but 65% of its sales come from domestic customers. Knowing about the currency mismatch, Chinese carriers have spent the past year swapping some of their dollar debt for yuan debt, turning to the burgeoning domestic bond market to raise cash. As the yuan continues to slide , however, this will get more expensive, as it will take more borrowed yuan to pay off the same amount of dollar debt. Interest rates in China have also risen since the U.S. election, with the 10-year yield up 0.13 percentage point to 2.89%. Given the airlines<U+2019> high debt loads and narrow margins, a rise in interest expenses eats into profits quickly.

        "original_post": "Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin beat back a strong bid from former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold, rallying the state<U+2019>s highly organized conservatives to his side despite their ambivalence for the party<U+2019>s presidential candidate, Donald Trump. Mr. Johnson won with 51.9% of the vote to Mr. Feingold<U+2019>s 45.2%, with the Associated Press calling the race with 69% of precincts reporting. It was a race of stark contrasts. Mr. Johnson, 61 years old, a former businessman who helped build a plastics company in Oshkosh, couldn't be more different from his challenger, Mr. Feingold, an avowed liberal who held the seat for three terms, starting in 1993, before Mr. Johnson ousted him in the Republican wave in 2010. Mr. Feingold, 63, started his campaign from a position of strength, pointing to his work in Washington reining in campaign spending as the author of a 2002 law with John McCain (R., Ariz.) that was aimed at reducing the influence of money in politics. But Mr. Johnson was able to turn things around over the course of the campaign by carefully positioning himself in relation to Mr. Trump<U+2014>and taking advantage of a surge of outside spending in the last several weeks. Mr. Johnson won in 2010 on a deficit-cutting message, but as austerity and debt have faded as key political forces, he broadened his focus to national-security issues, such as supporting a pause in a program to resettle Syrian refugees. For much of the campaign, he was running behind Mr. Feingold in the polls. But a surge of last-minute advertising by his campaign and by outside groups pushed him into the win column. His ads portrayed him as a down-to-earth Wisconsinite and Feingold as a cog in a liberal machine. In one quirky ad, Mr. Johnson is changing the diaper of his grandson and forgets to keep the little guy covered. The senator<U+2019>s daughter says he<U+2019>s <U+201C>exactly the guy we need to clean up the mess<U+201D> in Washington.",

        "original_post": "Donald Trump is only making things more difficult for Tiffany & Co. The luxury retailer<U+2019>s flagship Fifth Avenue store is next door to Trump Tower, where the president-elect resides. Protests and high security following the election have made it a nightmare to get anywhere in that part of Manhattan. Though a resulting decline in store traffic could crimp Tiffany<U+2019>s holiday results, macroeconomic concerns could <U+201C>trump<U+201D> the physical disruption. But first up are its results, due Tuesday, for the fiscal third quarter ended in October. After having ratcheted their expectations lower in recent months, analysts now forecast that Tiffany earned 67 cents a share, down three cents from a year ago. This estimate was as high as 83 cents at the end of last year. Revenue is expected to have fallen 1.5% to $924 million. Tiffany shares have underperformed the S&P 500 by 6 percentage points this year. Some of that is due to Wall Street<U+2019>s relatively tough times; bonuses are expected to fall for a third consecutive year and be about 5% to 10% smaller than a year ago, according to a report published earlier this month by consulting firm Johnson Associates Inc. That presents another blow to the flagship Fifth Avenue store, which makes up about 10% of overall revenue. Additionally, roughly 40% of those sales come from foreign tourists. Tiffany has acknowledged that spending by overseas visitors, particularly from China, isn<U+2019>t as strong as it used to be. Manhattan shopping splurges are far more costly due to the rising dollar , which last week hit a fresh 13-year high against major rivals. Tiffany<U+2019>s same-store sales have declined for three consecutive quarters and four of the past six. Analysts expect they dropped again in the third quarter, falling 4.1% from a year earlier. Mr. Trump isn<U+2019>t helping matters. Analysts at Cowen & Co. estimate Tiffany<U+2019>s fourth-quarter earnings could fall by three cents a share if store traffic dropped by 50% in the two weeks following the election.<U+00A0>And each additional week of protests and traffic disruption could lop another three to five cents a share off the bottom line. Tiffany<U+2019>s jewelry isn<U+2019>t a bargain. Neither is its stock price. Fetching 20 times projected earnings over the next 12 months, Tiffany<U+2019>s multiple is higher than average and richer than rivals LVMH Mo<U+00EB>t Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE , Burberry Group PLC and Coach Inc.

        "original_post": "The state of the economy and the job market rumbles through every U.S. presidential election , in some years more fatefully than others. The financial crisis in 2008, when the country lost 473,000 jobs in October, helped tilt the balance toward Barack Obama. Improving numbers four years later aided in his re-election. Friday<U+2019>s<U+00A0>jobs report notched another month of strong jobs growth , while the 4.9% unemployment rate was the second-lowest in 40 years for the month before a presidential election. Theoretically, that should be good news for Hillary Clinton, who as the Democratic nominee has had to embrace the Obama economy, for better or worse. But the question now is whether next week<U+2019>s vote most resembles 1988 or 2000. In both those years, the unemployment rate was low at 5.3% and 3.9%, respectively, and the economy had been booming for years as a relatively popular president had served two terms. But while voters in 1988 gave Republicans a third term in the White House by electing President George H.W. Bush to succeed Ronald Reagan, a roaring economy in 2000 wasn<U+2019>t enough to catapult Vice President Al Gore into the White House. This year, Mrs. Clinton has talked up strong jobs numbers while striving not to overstate the economic gains, for risk of sounding deaf to the voter anxieties exploited by her Republican rival, Donald Trump. The Trump campaign has accentuated any and all weaknesses. On Friday the campaign pointed to the monthly drop in the overall size of the labor force<U+2014>it fell 0.1% from September but was still 1.7% higher than a year earlier<U+2014>as one sign of what it called the <U+201C>total failures<U+201D> of what it called <U+201C>the Obama-Clinton economy.<U+201D> Employers this year have added an average of almost 181,000 jobs monthly, slightly ahead of the pace that helped Mr. Obama defeat Mitt Romney. The economy added fewer jobs in the months before the 2000 election, but far more<U+2014>around 261,000 a month<U+2014>before the 1988 election. With hiring running at a strong pace and the unemployment rate falling steadily over the past three years, Republicans have turned their focus to other measures of labor slack, especially the labor-force participation rate, currently stuck at its lowest levels since the 1970s. Those declines partly reflect structural changes in the economy<U+2014>namely the aging of the workforce. But they also capture other challenges, such as the fading numbers of lower-skilled manufacturing jobs. Mr. Trump and his supporters have also pointed to the 94.6 million people who aren<U+2019>t in the labor force, the vast majority of whom are either retired, in school or taking care of family. Fewer than 8 million are unemployed, down from more than 12 million in 2012 and 10 million in 2008. Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "In among the foreign-exchange fireworks, the euro looks like the currency 2016 forgot<U+2014>at least against the dollar. That could change as the end of the year approaches. The euro has proved remarkably stable against the dollar this year. While the pound has plummeted and many emerging-market currencies have made strong gains, the single currency has moved for months in a narrow range centered around $1.12. But in the past week it has started to move, hitting its lowest point in two and a half months on Thursday morning just below $1.10. The deliberations at the U.S. Federal Reserve in September show that policy divergence is back on the agenda, with the likelihood of a rate rise in the U.S. increasing. The gap between U.S. and German two-year bond yields<U+2014>locked, like the euro, in a narrow range for months around 1.3 percentage points<U+2014>has now widened to above 1.5 points. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank next week could seek to strike a slightly more reassuring tone on its bond-purchasing program, although investors seem likely to have to wait until December for action. The other force that could drive the pair is political risk, and more in the U.S. than in Europe. The U.S. election campaign is entering its final phase . Markets tend to pay limited attention to politics until absolutely forced to consider them. The pound has shown what can happen when markets get their assessment of the political outlook<U+2014>and thus the structural basis for an economy -- wrong. A victory for Hillary Clinton would likely diminish any political-risk premium priced into the dollar, potentially giving the greenback a lift. Based on polling, a win for Donald Trump at this point would be an even bigger surprise than Brexit, stoking uncertainty and volatility . The moves in the euro against the dollar might not be as explosive as that seen for other currencies this year. But the exchange rate could well prove more lively in the final quarter than it has for some time. Write to Richard Barley at richard.barley@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "A jet carrying then-Vice Presidential candidate Mike Pence landed unusually far down a wet New York City runway and its pilots waited seven seconds to reverse thrust before veering off the strip last month, according to federal investigators. The latest update on the incident, released<U+00A0>Tuesday<U+00A0>by the National Transportation Safety Board, said the cockpit crew told investigators the chartered Boeing Co. 737 <U+201C>floated<U+201D> above the La Guardia Airport runway during the final landing maneuver, when the nose of the plane was raised. The main landing gear contacted the ground <U+201C>about 3,000 feet beyond the runway threshold,<U+201D> according to what pilots told investigators, or nearly halfway down the roughly 7,000-foot strip. Pilots of big jets such as the Boeing 737 are trained to typically touch down within the first 1,000 feet of any runway, especially when it is wet or snowy or otherwise slippery due to stormy weather or surface contamination. All of the 48 people on board escaped injuries, but traffic at the busy airport was disrupted for hours. The safety board hasn<U+2019>t formally determined the probable cause, and it will release detailed information at a later date. But the initial findings, spelled out in seven brief paragraphs, strongly suggest the event, called a runway excursion, wasn<U+2019>t the result of some previously undisclosed mechanical problem. The safety board said the flight crew <U+201C>did not report any mechanical irregularities or abnormal braking action, which was corroborated<U+201D> by information downloaded from the flight-data recorder. The NTSB also said that as part of the probe, investigators interviewed pilots of four other planes that landed just before the incident. None of those flight crews <U+201C>reported any problems with braking action on the wet runway,<U+201D> according to Tuesday<U+2019>s statement. Investigators previously said preliminary data showed the jet was flying at an appropriate speed during its final descent. At the time, they also disclosed that a device intended to automatically raise panels on top of the wings to help slow aircraft upon landing wasn<U+2019>t functioning. The crew was aware of the issue before takeoff and according to investigators, manually deployed the panels, called speed brakes, about four seconds after touchdown. Immediately after the runway incident, government and independent air-safety experts stressed the New York City field is renowned for its short runway <U+2014>squeezed between water and highways<U+2014>putting a premium on getting wheels on the ground as quickly as possible Write to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com",

Europe<U+2019>s largest telecom provider is well diversified, and its shares offer an increasingly rare combination of yield and value. Of course, the company has its problems. Those in India featured most prominently in half-year results Tuesday. Reliance Industries is playing the disrupter with its cut-price Jio brand , which launched in September. Vodafone<U+2019>s key growth metric in the country slowed, and management took the precaution of writing down the value of goodwill and assets by <U+20AC>5 billion ($5.4 billion)<U+2014>more than a year<U+2019>s group operating profits. The shrinking, low-margin U.K. business is another headache. Vodafone has been building high-quality landline networks in most European countries through a mixture of cable acquisitions, deals with utility providers and capital spending. But in the U.K. it is still selling consumer broadband services using rival BT Group <U+2019>s old copper network. There was no hint in these results of the much-speculated deal with John Malone <U+2019>s Liberty Global that would resolve this problem. Yet these two countries together account for only a quarter of sales. Overall, business is improving. Underlying growth rose to 2.4% in the second quarter, the best in years, thanks in particular to a much-improved European mobile business. Crucially, cash flows are also stronger now that the group is spending less on upgrading networks. These cash flows fund Vodafone<U+2019>s big dividends, which give the shares an eye-catching yield of 5.5%. True, if the postelection rotation away from bonds and yield stocks gathers pace, telecom shares may come under further pressure. Yet expectations of faster growth have been frustrated many times before, and Vodafone<U+2014>with an enterprise value just 6.3 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization<U+2014>doesn<U+2019>t trade at a bond-like valuation premium.

Trump declared himself <U+201C>a big fan of Hindu<U+201D> and praised India<U+2019>s nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, at an Indian-American charity event on Saturday. Mr. Trump spoke at a benefit put on by the Republican Hindu Coalition at a convention center in Edison, N.J., a non-battleground stop that is hardly typical for a presidential nominee three weeks before an election. Still, Mr. Trump seemed thrilled to be there. <U+201C>I am a big fan of Hindu, and I am a big fan of India,<U+201D> Mr. Trump said, seeming to entangle the faith with the nation. <U+201C>Big, big fan.<U+201D> While polls show that Hillary Clinton draws far more backing from Indian-Americans than Mr. Trump does, his anti-bureaucracy and country-first language closely tracks that of Mr. Modi, who has tapped into the disgust that India<U+2019>s Hindu majority feels toward its government. This has given Mr. Trump a foothold of support among Hindus in the United States, some of whom are also drawn to his strong talk about Muslims, their longtime adversaries on the subcontinent. Mr. Trump said that Mr. Modi<U+2019>s view of government was in line with his own. <U+201C>I look forward to doing some serious bureaucratic trimming right here in the United States,<U+201D> Mr. Trump said. His remarks were preceded by musical numbers set to Michael Jackson tunes, and by a sketch depicting terrorists attacking a nightclub. Proceeds from the event were to go to victims of terrorism. Mr. Trump also said that India would be the United States<U+2019> most significant ally in his administration. <U+201C>We will stand shoulder to shoulder with India in sharing intelligence and keeping our people safe mutually,<U+201D> Mr. Trump said. He then blamed his opponent, Hillary Clinton, for the rise of terrorism. <U+201C>This is so important in the age of ISIS, the barbaric threat Hillary Clinton has unleashed on the entire world,<U+201D> he said, using an acronym for the Islamic State.

        "original_post": "WASHINGTON<U+2014>House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) on Wednesday halted a growing push among House Republicans to bring back <U+201C>earmarks,<U+201D> lawmakers<U+2019> ability to direct federal funding to specific projects. In a closed-door meeting of House Republicans, Mr. Ryan stepped in and stopped lawmakers from passing a change to their internal rules on Wednesday that would have allowed them to make limited funding requests for their districts, according to House GOP aides. Mr. Ryan noted that Republican Donald Trump had just won the White House last week with a pledge to <U+201C>drain the swamp,<U+201D> and that the House couldn<U+2019>t immediately turn around and bring back the practice without public debate, according to someone in the room. He pledged to debate the issue more thoroughly and let them vote on it by the end of March 2017. House Republicans had been debating a proposal from Rep. Tom Rooney (R., Fla.) that would have let lawmakers request funding only for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation projects, aides said. It was clear from comments at the meeting, aides said, that there was support for the measure from lawmakers annoyed that they had ceded some of the more granular funding decisions to the executive branch after banning earmarks in 2010 . <U+201C>There<U+2019>s a lot of pent-up frustration that we have voluntarily given our congressional authority to the executive branch,<U+201D> Rep. Mike Rogers (R., Ala.), a supporter of the new push, said Wednesday night. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s time to take that back in a responsible way.<U+201D> Mr. Rogers said he expected the proposal would be approved by House Republicans next year. But the effort sparked an immediate backlash outside the Capitol, fanned by the suspicions of conservative groups that have long called earmarks emblematic of rampant federal spending and lawmakers helping out special-interest groups. <U+201C>Earmarks have come to symbolize everything wrong with how Washington does business, and the effort by some Republican lawmakers to bring them back shows they aren<U+2019>t serious about changing a thing,<U+201D> Andy Koenig, a vice president at Freedom Partners, a conservative group affiliated with the Koch brothers, said in a statement Wednesday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), who previously supported the practice, said he didn<U+2019>t think they would return in the Senate. But retiring Minority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) called himself <U+201C>one of the kings of earmarks<U+201D> Wednesday, and vigorously advocated for their return. <U+201C>It was a terrible disservice to America to come up with this stupid idea<U+2014>stupid idea<U+2014>to stop congressional-directed spending,<U+201D> Mr. Reid told reporters. <U+201C>I<U+2019>ve never apologized to anybody.

        "original_post": "The Mexican peso, which for investors has been a proxy for Donald J. Trump <U+2019>s presidential prospects, took a beating early Wednesday in the wake of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory. The peso started to dip from the moment the polls closed on Tuesday, and it nose-dived overnight to a record low as the 24-hour global currency market digested the outcome of the American presidential election in real time . The currency slid more than 12 percent against the dollar as investors began to wonder what would happen to Mexico<U+2019>s autos, oil and other exports, most of which it sends north to the United States. In early trading on Wednesday, the peso had trimmed its loss to less than 8 percent. The peso is used as a broad proxy for Latin American and other emerging-market investments that are less liquid and easy to hedge. That means that it bears the brunt of market sentiment and that it is a frequent choice of anyone looking to bet against emerging markets, which in turn contributes to its hyperactive response to risky events. Mexico, which has the second-largest economy in Latin America after Brazil, was frequently included in the election campaign headlines as Mr. Trump discussed plans for building a wall to cut off immigrants and trade between the United States and its southern neighbor. The market may have been unprepared for Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory, but it was not unaware of the risk. Going into Monday, it became very expensive to buy options on the Mexican peso <U+2014> a reflection of the market<U+2019>s pricing of uncertainty over the election outcome. Traders and investors, however, were not fully prepared for the result, and that lack of preparation contributed to the peso<U+2019>s rout. Deutsche Bank currency strategists, in a note to investors on Monday, compared options to buy and options to sell on the peso-dollar combination and concluded that the market appeared to be covered if Hillary Clinton won the election but exposed if Mr. Trump prevailed. The Mexican currency is the most traded in emerging markets, and it was sensitive to polls throughout the campaign, waxing when Mrs. Clinton was in the lead and waning when Mr. Trump took the edge. Still, even in less-sensitive market conditions, the peso has been struggling against the dollar. The value of Mexico<U+2019>s currency is tied to the country<U+2019>s oil exports, and it has been on a losing streak since the price of oil started to tumble in 2014.",

        "original_post": "The rise in global bond yields inspired by Donald Trump <U+2019>s U.S. election victory has been a tonic to bank stocks everywhere. Well, almost. Italian banks are enduring another mini-crisis of confidence on twin concerns about political stability and whether weaker banks can raise the capital that they need. That can be seen in a government bond selloff that has been deeper than most other eurozone nations and has increased the gap between Italian and German 10-year yields to its widest since May 2014. On the political front, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi faces a referendum on constitutional reform on Dec. 4, which he could lose, putting his job in doubt . Though he has tried to back away from earlier moves to tie his premiership to the vote, some still expect him to stand down if he fails to get at least 40% support and others believe losing by any margin will be enough for him to walk. This threat of instability comes just as Italy<U+2019>s banks are trying to put their houses in order. Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena is in the middle of a crucial capital raising and bad-loan restructuring exercise, which will hurt the whole sector if it fails. MPS<U+2019>s highly volatile shares will be all but wiped out in the capital raise, but other big Italian lenders like UniCredit , UBI Banca and Intesa Sanpaolo have seen their shares fall since the U.S. election. Elsewhere in Europe, many banks are up on hopes that steeper yield curves will help profits. MPS this week released terms for a proposed debt-for-equity swap that could bring in <U+20AC>1.5 billion ($1.6 billion) of the <U+20AC>5 billion equity it needs. The terms are well above where the bonds have been trading, offering holders of junior tier 1 debt 85% of face value and slightly less junior tier 2 bonds 100% of face value. If the swap fails, the whole exercise could collapse, leaving MPS to go through a painful resolution. Despite the risk of substantial losses in that case, individual bondholders might still not participate in the hopes that other bondholders do, leaving them with a safer bond in a recapitalized bank that still pays a juicy interest rate. It is a classic prisoner<U+2019>s dilemma. Failure for MPS would mean widespread losses for large numbers of retail investors, more political fallout and less chance that Italy<U+2019>s largest bank UniCredit can raise the <U+20AC>10 billion-plus in fresh capital that it is likely to target in coming months . That would be disastrous. For Italy, the next two weeks look to be make or break. Write to Paul J. Davies at paul.davies@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Athene Holding Ltd. submitted an amended filing for its coming initial public offering that could value the fixed-annuities provider at about $8 billion. Athene on Monday began the so-called roadshow to market the IPO to investors, according to a person familiar with the matter. The shares are expected to begin trading next week. The firm, backed by a private-equity group Apollo Global Management LLC, said the company itself wouldn't receive any proceeds from the public sale of stock. Instead, the insurer<U+2019>s IPO stands to benefit selling shareholders, including Apollo and its executives, according to the filing . The company set an estimated range of $38 to $42 a share for the offering of nearly 23.8 million class A shares, plus roughly 3.6 million shares in a so-called overallotment clause that gives underwriters the option to buy into the company at the IPO price. At the high-end of the range, the selling shareholders stand to raise as much as $1.15 billion in the IPO and the company would be valued at about $8 billion. Athene<U+2019>s stock is slated to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol <U+201C>ATH.<U+201D> Apollo has for years indicated IPO plans for Athene, whose growth has been a boon to the New York asset manager. The details outlined in a securities filing Monday set the stage for Athene to debut in public markets at the end of a tepid year for U.S.-listed IPOs. Stocks of insurance firms Athene competes with, such as Ameriprise Financial Inc., have rallied following Donald Trump<U+2019>s unexpected victory over Hillary Clinton earlier this month. Investors are betting that rising interest rates could benefit insurers, and that Mr. Trump could roll back regulations on the industry. Bermuda-based Athene has become a dominant player in fixed annuities<U+2014>savings contracts that promise to pay buyers a set amount of interest each year<U+2014>providing them to hundreds of thousands of retirees and other consumers. <U+2014>Maureen Farrell contributed to this article.

In just five trading sessions since Donald Trump <U+2019>s unexpected victory a basket of 10 casual eatery stocks has appreciated by 11% on average. That handily outpaces the market<U+2019>s overall gain . A number of industries might see some clear benefit from Trump<U+2019>s victory. Pharmaceutical, bank and energy stocks, along with sectors such as for-profit prison and education, could see a lighter regulatory touch, for example. Others that have cash trapped overseas may reap a windfall from a corporate tax amnesty. Still others such as construction firms or purveyors of luxury goods might gain from a burst of infrastructure spending or tax breaks for the well-off. Largely domestic restaurant stocks that cater to the middle class will enjoy none of these boons, though. What is more, the industry<U+2019>s fundamentals look poor even as the aforementioned group fetches a handsome 18 times forecast earnings. While food prices have been depressed, which would in theory help their bottom lines, labor and benefit costs have pressured them. But cheaper groceries also mean that the gap between the cost of meals at home and away from home is at levels typically seen only during recessions, according to Driehaus Capital Management. For middle-class families facing rising costs elsewhere, small luxuries such as meals out are often the first to suffer. This jibes with weak visitor trends they identify in the Knapp-Track Index, the leading measure for customer traffic in casual dining establishments.

After shielding the Australian anti-secrecy activist for more than four years from potential prosecution in Sweden, where he faces sexual assault charges , Ecuador cut off Mr. Assange<U+2019>s access to the internet over the weekend, according to WikiLeaks. In a tweet , WikiLeaks said Secretary of State John Kerry pressured Ecuador<U+2019>s foreign minister last month to prevent Mr. Assange from disclosing more emails involving Hillary Clinton . A State Department spokesman called the allegation <U+201C>simply untrue.<U+201D> The Ecuadorean government confirmed it had restricted internet access at the embassy, saying it <U+201C>respects the principle of nonintervention in the internal affairs of other states.<U+201D> It also said Mr. Assange<U+2019>s asylum status was unchanged. When Quito offered him refuge in June 2012, the government of President Rafael Correa saw an opportunity to rankle Washington, which he and other leftist leaders accuse of undermining their socialist governments. But relations between the United States and Ecuador have warmed up somewhat in recent years. Mr. Correa<U+2019>s government noted that it limited internet access after WikiLeaks released <U+201C>a wealth of documents impacting on the U.S. election campaign.<U+201D> They were hundreds of emails from the personal account of John Podesta, Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign chief, including many innocuous exchanges.

        "original_post": "NAGOYA, Japan<U+2014>Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda on Monday expressed mixed feelings about the rise of Donald Trump, saying the U.S. president-elect may help lift American growth but could deal Japan<U+2019>s economy a blow by scrapping a trade deal. <U+201C>Big benefits that could otherwise have been obtained may be lost<U+201D> if Mr. Trump acts on his campaign promise to scrap the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, Mr. Kuroda said at a news conference in the central Japanese city of Nagoya. But the Japanese central bank chief said financial markets were in a <U+201C>quite welcoming mode<U+201D> toward the Republican<U+2019>s unexpected victory, pointing to recent sharp gains in the dollar and U.S. stocks. Mr. Kuroda also sounded optimistic about Mr. Trump<U+2019>s promises to cut red tape for banks and increase government spending on infrastructure. <U+201C>I basically think that those measures will help the U.S. economy expand,<U+201D> Mr. Kuroda said. With both houses of Congress and the presidency now under Republican control, <U+201C>I am hoping that, under these circumstances, [U.S. policy makers] will handle economic policy in an appropriate manner so it will have favorable effects on the world and U.S. economies,<U+201D> he said. The remarks by Mr. Kuroda reflect a mixture of qualms and hopes among Tokyo officials about the coming U.S. administration. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pushed the sweeping TPP trade deal to boost Japan<U+2019>s diminishing growth prospects. Mr. Abe told parliament on Monday he doesn<U+2019>t believe the TPP is dead, although Republicans and Democrats have agreed it won<U+2019>t be taken up during the remainder of President Barack Obama <U+2019>s administration. On the plus side for Japan, expectations that Mr. Trump will stimulate the U.S. economy have helped strengthen the dollar against the yen, lifting Japanese exporters. Tokyo had worried before the election that a Trump victory would have the opposite impact on currencies. Mr. Kuroda took a sanguine view of two of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s signature policies--cracking down on immigration from Mexico and taking a tougher stance on trade with China. <U+201C>Rather than causing a direct effect on the Japanese economy, the effect, if any, would be indirect,<U+201D> he said.

        "original_post": "WASHINGTON<U+2014>Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser to President-elect Donald Trump, intensified her public effort<U+00A0>Sunday<U+00A0>to scuttle Mitt Romney <U+2019>s chances of becoming secretary of state. Making the rounds of the<U+00A0>Sunday<U+00A0>shows, Ms. Conway suggested Mr. Romney<U+2019>s harsh critique of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s character and qualifications during the presidential campaign amounted to an unforgivable betrayal of the Republican ticket. <U+201C>There was the Never Trump movement, and there was Gov. Mitt Romney,<U+201D> Ms. Conway told ABC<U+2019>s <U+201C>This Week.<U+201D> <U+201C>He went out of his way to hurt Donald Trump.<U+201D> The president-elect has met with Mr. Romney to discuss the top diplomatic post, and people familiar with Mr. Trump<U+2019>s deliberations have said the former Massachusetts governor has been under serious consideration. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is also on the list of possible choices to lead the State Department . Ms. Conway was vague as to whether Mr. Trump has blessed her anti-Romney campaign, which began on Twitter last week . Asked by ABC host Martha Raddatz whether she had cleared her attacks with the president-elect, Ms. Conway responded: <U+201C>I won<U+2019>t discuss that.<U+201D> Later she tweeted that she had advised Mr. Trump against Mr. Romney, who was the 2012 Republican presidential candidate. <U+201C>I did tell him privately,<U+201D> she tweeted. <U+201C>And I<U+2019>ll respect his decision.<U+201D> Ms. Conway told CNN<U+2019>s <U+201C>State of the Union<U+201D> that she had been deluged with emails from Trump supporters opposed to the idea of Mr. Romney<U+2019>s serving in the cabinet, an outpouring she described as <U+201C>just breathtaking in scope and intensity.<U+201D> Mr. Romney was among the most-outspoken Trump critics during the election campaign. In March, Mr. Romney gave a pointed speech lambasting Mr. Trump<U+2019>s views and character. <U+201C>There<U+2019>s plenty of evidence that Mr. Trump is a con man, a fake,<U+201D> Mr. Romney said, adding that he is <U+201C>playing the members of the American public for suckers.<U+201D> <U+201C>His domestic policies would lead to recession,<U+201D> Mr. Romney said. <U+201C>His foreign policies would make America and the world less safe. He has neither the temperament nor the judgment to be president and his personal qualities would mean that America would cease to be a shining city on a hill.<U+201D> Some on the right say Mr. Romney<U+2019>s role at State would comfort those worried about Mr. Trump<U+2019>s foreign-policy instincts. <U+201C>He<U+2019>d provide some stability and a calming effect internationally,<U+201D> conservative pundit Erick Erickson tweeted to Ms. Conway last week. <U+201C>Trump would be smart to do it.<U+201D> Ms. Conway, who was Mr. Trump<U+2019>s campaign manager, said Mr. Trump has already taken steps to placate various factions within the GOP.

        "original_post": "No matter whether you lean blue or red, the first and second presidential debates were stomach-churning experiences. The decline of civil discourse, the low popularity ratings of both candidates and the general feeling of gloom for U.S. democracy settled over living rooms, bars and Facebook comment threads. Some viewers deal with debates using drinking games. We suggest a healthier alternative for Wednesday<U+2019>s third and final debate : yoga. (Follow the Journal<U+2019>s live analysis of the final presidential debate.) These poses, designed to keep you facing the TV, will help you cope with every interruption, accusation and revelation. Take it slowly, and don<U+2019>t forget to breathe. Lie facedown with the tops of your feet on the floor and palms down with bent elbows. Push the floor away until your arms are straight and your upper body is off the floor. Strike this pose when someone brings up Hillary Clinton <U+2019>s use of a private email server while Secretary of State. It won<U+2019>t remove all traces of anxiety, but it might help. Lie facedown with legs side by side. Place your forearms on the floor parallel to each other with elbows under your shoulders. Hold the position for as long as it takes to explain all the perfectly legal ways to rack up millions of dollars in tax deductions . Or until your arms give out. Stand upright, arms reaching to the sky, then tilt forward at the waist and extend your right leg backward while balancing on your left leg. Strike this pose when someone brings up Donald Trump <U+2019>s lewd comments about women in a leaked video, which he described as <U+201C>locker-room talk.<U+201D> Side benefit of this pose: You can use your arms to cover your ears. From a standing position, raise your arms then exhale and bend your knees until thighs are parallel to the floor. Hold this pose as long as possible when someone asks how Hillary Clinton<U+2019>s paid talks to Wall Street bankers square with her appeals to the working class. Start on your hands and knees with your back flat. As you slowly inhale, let your belly drop while tilting your chest toward the ceiling. Exhale, and let your back rise until it<U+2019>s flat again. Repeat as many times as Donald Trump says <U+201C>rigged.<U+201D> Start on hands and knees with a flat back. Exhale and round your back toward the ceiling, like a frightened Halloween cat. This pose is for when Democrats remember that Hillary Clinton, despite leading in the polls, still has one of the lowest favorability ratings in the history of presidential politics. (Note: Undecided voters can put their heads down and curl up into child<U+2019>s pose .) Write to Rachel Bachman at rachel.bachman@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "TOKYO<U+2014>The Bank of Japan on Thursday offered to buy an unlimited amount of Japanese government bonds at fixed rates for the first time since the introduction of a new policy framework<U+2014>a sign of its concerns over recent rises in yields. The move is the first clear sign from the central bank that it intends to take action to keep a lid on rising yields, and took market participants by surprise. <U+201C>I thought there was still a lot more room left<U+201D> before the BOJ took action, said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. The BOJ<U+2019>s move followed a sharp rise in government bond yields globally, sparked by expectations that the presidency of Donald Trump would lift inflation and growth. Japanese government bond yields have risen as well, but not as sharply. The 10-year yield rose to its highest level since March on Wednesday. Yields on two-year and five-year Japanese government bonds fell Thursday after the BOJ<U+2019>s announcement. The 10-year yield also briefly fell to 0.010% after hitting as high as 0.025% earlier in the morning. Speaking in parliament, Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda said he wouldn<U+2019>t allow market pressure from abroad to dictate the course of Japanese government bond yields, highlighting his resolve to hold interest rates down. <U+201C>Interest rates may have risen in the U.S., but that doesn<U+2019>t mean that we have to automatically allow Japanese interest rates to increase in tandem,<U+201D> Mr. Kuroda said In Thursday<U+2019>s action, the BOJ offered to buy unlimited amounts of government bonds with terms of between one year and five years at a fixed price. It was the first such move since the central bank introduced what it called <U+201C>yield curve control<U+201D> in September, an attempt to keep short-term interest rates low while allowing longer-term rates to rise. The BOJ said its offering price would be slightly lower than prevailing prices on those bonds. A BOJ official said the offer was meant to send a signal that the central bank wanted to counter sharp rises in short- and midterm yields. The bank said later that no financial firms offered to sell Japanese government bonds at fixed rates on Thursday. <U+201C>Because the rates were fixed at higher than market levels, it<U+2019>s natural that nobody wanted to sell, considering market principles,<U+201D> said Deutsche Securities strategist Makoto Yamashita. The BOJ<U+2019>s action, however, was likely to have <U+201C>announcement effects<U+201D> by telling the markets that the bank would intervene to stop sharp rises in the shorter-end of the yield curve, and the message now seems to be received by the markets, he said. <U+2014>Takashi Nakamichi and Hiroyuki Kachi contributed to this article.

Canadians will be watching its neighbor to the south closely on Tuesday to see how the U.S. presidential race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump plays out. Talk of U.S. job seekers looking to Canada depending on how the chips fall in the election, and antitrade rhetoric, which is clouding Canada<U+2019>s export forecast , are among the topics of interest ahead of the vote. On the data front this week, housing dominates. On Tuesday, October housing starts and September building permits are due out, followed by September new house prices on Thursday. Bank of Canada Deputy Governor Lawrence Schembri is scheduled to speak in Halifax, Nova Scotia early Tuesday on the topic of historical changes and future prospects for Canadian exports. The central bank has faced regular disappointment on the export front over the past year, with Canada<U+2019>s nonresource exports remaining sluggish despite a weak Canadian dollar.

        "original_post": "From <U+201C>China Just Won The U.S. Election<U+201D> by James Palmer on the Foreign Policy magazine website: China no longer faces the prospect of Hillary Clinton, a tough, experienced opponent with a record of standing up to bullies. Instead, it faces a know-nothing reality TV star who barely seems aware that China has nuclear weapons, has promised to extort money from U.S. allies around China like South Korea and Japan, and has repeatedly undercut U.S. credibility as a defense partner. Trump is also exactly the kind of businessman who is most easily taken in by China<U+2014>credulous, focused on the externalities of wealth, and massively susceptible to flattery. A single trip, with Chinese laying on the charm, could leave him as fond of China<U+2019>s strongmen as he is of Russia<U+2019>s Putin. Countries like Vietnam, Myanmar, and the Philippines, uncertain about who to back in the contest for power in the Pacific, will swing massively China<U+2019>s way, preferring a country that keeps its promises to one that can turn on the pull of an electoral lever. The strongest U.S. allies, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan, no longer confident in the U.S. nuclear umbrella, will begin seriously considering other alternatives<U+2014>like acquiring their own nuclear deterrent, prompting new tensions with China.... But there<U+2019>s one major worry that may mute the celebrations in Zhongnanhai. Although China regularly trashes the U.S., the country<U+2019>s growth has been dependent, ironically enough, on a strong, stable and prosperous United States willing to trade with the world. Globalization, as Chinese authors have repeatedly argued in the last few months, is vital for a country that needs the markets of others to keep pushing its population into the middle class and achieve the dream of being a <U+201C>moderately prosperous<U+201D> country by 2020.",

        "original_post": "Joe Arpaio, the Arizona sheriff famous for his aggressive pursuit of undocumented immigrants, will face a criminal contempt-of-court charge for defying a judge<U+2019>s order to stop conducting immigration patrols in the state. Federal prosecutors said they planned to go forward with the criminal contempt case at a court hearing in Phoenix<U+00A0>on Tuesday, less than a month before Election Day. Mr. Arpaio is running for a seventh term as Maricopa County sheriff. Mr. Arpaio<U+2019>s lawyer, Mel McDonald, said <U+201C>there was never any criminal contempt and we<U+2019>re going to vehemently fight that.<U+201D> He added that Mr. Arpaio is <U+201C>very disappointed<U+201D> by the government<U+2019>s decision. If convicted, the 84-year-old could face up to six months in jail. A federal judge recommended criminal contempt charges against Mr. Arpaio earlier this year, but it was left to U.S. Department of Justice prosecutors whether to proceed with the case. Prosecutors on Tuesday said they would charge Mr. Arpaio but not any of his subordinates. They are expected to file paperwork to formalize the charge Wednesday. Mr. McDonald, the lawyer representing Mr. Arpaio, said the sheriff would push for a trial by jury. <U+201C>We were not surprised that the case was brought<U+2014>the Department of Justice has been pursuing Sheriff Arpaio for six or seven years, Mr. McDonald said. <U+201C>We<U+2019>re going to fight this with every ounce of energy in court.<U+201D> Mr. Arpaio<U+2019>s aggressive immigration patrols have helped make him a household name. This year, he has stumped for Donald Trump in several states, and he spoke at the Republican National Convention. Mr. Arpaio<U+2019>s efforts to stem illegal immigration have caused him political and legal problems in recent years. The criminal contempt charges stem from a 2007 lawsuit accusing his department of racial profiling. That suit is expected to cost Maricopa County taxpayers more than $40 million, according to a county estimate. Federal criminal contempt-of-court charges against sitting law-enforcement officials are exceedingly rare, said Erik Luna, a professor at the Sandra Day O<U+2019>Connor College of Law at Arizona State University. He knew of only a handful of cases in the past few decades. <U+201C>It indicates the uniqueness of Sheriff Joe Arpaio,<U+201D> Mr. Luna said. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s hard to find someone who has been so overtly dismissive of the U.S. court system.<U+201D> The sheriff has admitted that a judge<U+2019>s court order to stop carrying out immigration patrols wasn't carried out, but he has denied directing his sheriff<U+2019>s deputies to defy the court. Judge Susan R. Bolton, the U.S. District Judge presiding in the case, set a preliminary trial date of<U+00A0>Dec. 6, but Mr. McDonald said Mr. Arpaio would push for a later date.

As gold is priced in dollars, it becomes more expensive for holders of other currencies as the dollar appreciates.

        "original_post": "Hillary Clinton looks likely to win the popular vote for President, and so arrive the perennial calls for a direct popular election. Even Donald Trump said on CBS <U+2019>s <U+201C>60 Minutes<U+201D> this weekend that he<U+2019>d prefer <U+201C>simple votes.<U+201D> But the Electoral College, for all its imperfections, is still a better way to choose a President. The fact that Mrs. Clinton won the popular vote may console Democrats, but if that were the measure of victory we would have had a different campaign. Both candidates would have parked themselves in populous states like New York, and Mr. Trump would have spent weeks in Texas. As it is, the Republican nominee didn<U+2019>t compete in Illinois or California, allowing Mrs. Clinton to pile up big majorities. Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s advantage in California alone<U+2014>more than 2.7 million votes<U+2014>accounts for more than her projected margin of victory of about two million. One feature of the Electoral College is that it picks a decisive winner as early as possible. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory across the Midwest gave him a solid majority in the Electoral College that everyone acknowledged. There was no waiting for absentee ballots or recounts. If you think a recount in one state like Florida in 2000 was corrosive, imagine a tight popular vote with contested results in 50 states and thousands of counties. The opportunities for fraud, or claims of fraud, would be endless. The system also tends to narrow the field to two candidates who have a plausible path to 270 electoral votes. This is a weakness when the major parties produce two unpopular nominees, but that is an argument for the parties choosing better candidates. The Electoral College reduces the relevance of fringe candidates who could otherwise force themselves into importance in a national poll. Most voters in the end abandon third-party candidates so they won<U+2019>t <U+201C>waste<U+201D> their vote. That<U+2019>s what happened this year as voters moved away from Gary Johnson or Jill Stein. Democrats gripe that their candidate won the popular vote in six of the past seven presidential elections but won only four. Yet before Tuesday they were saying Mrs. Clinton had the Electoral College advantage even if she lost the popular vote. They could be right in the future. The point for the country is whether the Electoral College helps elect a clear and legitimate winner, and this year it did so again. Larry Arnn discusses the constitutional underpinnings of the Electoral College nearby . The Founders selected the system in part to moderate the worst impulses of a concentrated majority. Even after last week<U+2019>s political earthquake, Alexander Hamilton <U+2019>s words for the Electoral College in Federalist No. 68 hold up: <U+201C>If the manner of it be not perfect, it is at least excellent.<U+201D>",

        "original_post": "SAN FRANCISCO <U+2014> After more than a week of accusations that the spread of fake news on Facebook may have affected the outcome of the presidential election, Mark Zuckerberg published a detailed post Friday night describing ways the company was considering dealing with the problem. Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook<U+2019>s chairman and chief executive, broadly outlined some of the options he said the company<U+2019>s news feed team was looking into, including third-party verification services, better automated detection tools and simpler ways for users to flag suspicious content. <U+201C>The problems here are complex, both technically and philosophically,<U+201D> Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. <U+201C>We believe in giving people a voice, which means erring on the side of letting people share what they want whenever possible.<U+201D> The post was perhaps the most detailed glimpse into Mr. Zuckerberg<U+2019>s thinking on the issue since Donald J. Trump<U+2019>s defeat of Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election. Within hours of his victory being declared, Facebook was accused of affecting the election<U+2019>s outcome by failing to stop bogus news stories, many of them favorable to Mr. Trump, from proliferating on its social network. Executives and employees at all levels of the company have since been debating its role and responsibilities . Facebook initially tried to play down concerns about the issue, with Mr. Zuckerberg calling the notion that the company swayed the election <U+201C> a pretty crazy idea <U+201D> at a technology conference on Nov. 10. In a follow-up Facebook post, he said that less than 1 percent of the news posted to Facebook was false. But questions continued from outside the company, with some complaining that it was being too dismissive of its capacity to affect public opinion. In a news conference in Berlin on Thursday, President Obama denounced the spread of misinformation on Facebook and other platforms. Mr. Zuckerberg came to no conclusions in his post on Friday, instead providing a list of possible solutions the company was exploring. One option, he said, could be attaching warnings to news articles shared on Facebook that have been flagged as false by reputable third parties or by Facebook users. Another could be making it harder for websites to make money from spreading misinformation on Facebook, he said. Mr. Zuckerberg made it clear that Facebook would take care to avoid looking or acting like a media company, a label it has frequently resisted. <U+201C>We need to be careful not to discourage sharing of opinions or mistakenly restricting accurate content,<U+201D> Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. <U+201C>We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves, but instead rely on our community and trusted third parties.<U+201D> A version of this article appears in print on November 20, 2016, on Page A4 of the New York edition with the headline: Facebook May Fight Fake News, Chief Says.

        "original_post": "Hillary Clinton and President Obama are outraged about the F.B.I. director James Comey<U+2019>s decision to disclose further inquiries into her handling of confidential email, but are the American people? Although numerous prosecutors and former Department of Justice officials have accused Mr. Comey of violating formal guidelines and informal norms against commenting on continuing investigations or publicizing political cases just before elections, voters do not seem to share their indignation. In an online Morning Consult poll of approximately 3,200 registered voters, only 19 percent agreed with the statement that prosecutors should wait until after Election Day to make announcements about investigations concerning political figures or elected officials. Instead , 60 percent agreed that prosecutors should be able to make announcements about investigations concerning political figures or elected officials close to Election Day even if it might affect the election. (Another 21 percent said they don<U+2019>t know or had no opinion.) Not surprisingly, these results differ along partisan lines. Democrats were five times more likely than Republicans to say prosecutors should wait to make announcements about political figures (33 percent versus 6 percent). Conversely, people who identified as Republicans were much more likely than Democrats to endorse the idea of announcing cases before elections (79 percent versus 47 percent). To understand the extent to which partisanship affects people<U+2019>s opinions on the issue, Morning Consult asked the same question to three randomly selected groups. The first group saw a generic statement without reference to Mrs. Clinton or Donald J. Trump, which yielded the results described above. Other groups were prompted with either a statement about the F.B.I. inquiry into Mrs. Clinton or one about the New York attorney general<U+2019>s investigation into the practices of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s foundation. When the investigation into Mrs. Clinton was mentioned before the question, partisans differed by almost 50 percentage points in their attitude toward pre-election disclosures, which were endorsed by 83 percent of Republicans but just 34 percent of Democrats <U+2014> an even larger gap than observed with the generic prompt. By contrast, mentioning Mr. Trump<U+2019>s foundation eliminated the gap between the parties in support for publicizing investigations, which was backed by 57 percent of Democrats and 58 percent of Republicans. The lesson from these findings is clear: The public wants to know everything it can about the candidates in advance, especially if they are from the other party.

        "original_post": "Heather Mac Donald, writing Sunday in <U+201C> Trumped-Up Outrage <U+201D> on City Journal<U+2019>s website: Now why might it be that men regard women as sex objects? Surely the ravenous purchase by females of stiletto heels, push-up bras, butt-hugging mini-skirts, plunging necklines, false eyelashes, hair extensions, breast implants, butt implants, lip implants, and mascara, rouge, and lipstick to the tune of billions a year has nothing to do with it. Females would never ever exploit their sexuality to seek attention from men. [Billy] Bush and Trump, driving to the set of Days of Our Lives on a studio bus, comment on the legs of actress Arianne Zucker who is coming to meet them: <U+201C>Oh, nice legs, huh?<U+201D> Trump says. <U+201C>Your girl<U+2019>s hot as s---, in the purple,<U+201D> Bush says. How surprising that Trump and Bush noticed Zucker<U+2019>s legs! As documented in the video, she is wearing a skimpy purple dress, with an extremely short hem cut on the bias, a low neckline and fully exposed back. She is in high heels to accentuate her bare legs. The ratio of exposed skin between Zucker, on the one hand, and Trump and Bush, on the other, is perhaps 100 to one. But all that bare flesh must simply be because Zucker has a high metabolism and gets exceedingly warm; she would never want to broadcast her sexuality to men or have men notice her. The fact that she swishes her hips when she walks must just be a quirk of anatomy. . . . The sudden onset of Victorian vapors among the liberal intelligentsia and political class at the revelation of Trump<U+2019>s locker-room talk is part and parcel of the Left<U+2019>s hypocrisy when it comes to feminism and sexual liberation. . . . But the feminists can<U+2019>t have it both ways: declaring that women should be equal to men in all things and then still demand a chivalric deference to female<U+2019>s delicate sensibilities. Either women are the same as men or they<U+2019>re not. It is particularly galling to see the selective resurrection of Victorian values from the same crowd that has been pushing transgender locker rooms on the world, in an effort to destroy the last shred of girls<U+2019> innate sexual modesty.",

        "original_post": "WASHINGTON<U+2014>Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara defended his office<U+2019>s pursuit of insider trading and said the Supreme Court may soon make it easier for his prosecutors to pursue such cases. Speaking at The Wall Street Journal<U+2019>s CEO Council meeting<U+00A0>on Tuesday, he said there is <U+201C>cautious optimism<U+201D> the Supreme Court will <U+201C>correct what we think is the clear mistake,<U+201D> referring to a 2014 appeals court decision that threw out a major insider trading case. In October, the Supreme Court heard arguments in an insider-trading case that involved tips passed through relatives. Two years ago, a New York federal appeals court threw out U.S. v. Newman , which involved tips passed through a chain of traders. That ruling was a blow to Mr. Bharara <U+2019>s aggressive strategy, forcing his office to drop some cases and rethink others. In the interview, Mr. Bharara also said his office witnesses firsthand some of the problems that fueled anger in the presidential campaign and led to the election of Donald Trump, who ran as an outsider. <U+201C>Part of the election on both sides was about whether systems are rigged. And I can tell you from cases we have brought there is a lot that is rigged, on the Street and in politics,<U+201D> he said. In addition to dozens of high-profile insider trading cases, the Manhattan U.S. attorney<U+2019>s office has brought corruption cases against a dozen state lawmakers in New York and convicted the leaders of both legislative houses. <U+201C>I would like to think that the level of <U+00A0>aggressiveness in law enforcement will remain the same<U+2026>You<U+2019>re talking about things like keeping the markets fair and keeping the government honest, and I don<U+2019>t think we are seeing a departure from that, unless I<U+2019>m missing something big,<U+201D> Mr. Bharara said. Mr. Bharara said most of his office<U+2019>s insider-trading cases still stood the test of time, and referred to now-defunct hedge fund SAC Capital, which pleaded guilty in 2013 to insider trading and paid $1.8 billion in penalties. He cited it as an example of a firm that lacked an ethical culture. When it was negotiating its resolution, Mr. Bharara said prosecutors asked if the firm could provide an example of one time the CEO said in an email or speech, <U+201C>I care that people do their jobs honestly, with integrity.<U+201D> <U+201C>There was deafening silence,<U+201D> Mr. Bharara said.

        "original_post": "SAN DIEGO, Calif.<U+2014>Rep. Darrell Issa, one of the highest-profile Republicans in Congress, continued to hold a slim lead<U+00A0>Wednesday<U+00A0>night over his Democratic rival and declared himself close to victory. The closeness of the race for the eight-term congressman, who had generally won comfortable victories in the past, is a sign of the continuing weakness of the GOP in California. The 63-year-old Mr. Issa led Doug Applegate, a retired Marine colonel and Iraq war veteran, by a 51% to 49% margin, according to state records. By contrast, Donald Trump, while winning the presidency, lost in California to Hillary Clinton by nearly 30 percentage points. In an email, a spokesman for Mr. Applegate said, <U+201C>There are tens of thousands more votes to count. We are cautiously optimistic.<U+201D> <U+201C>As the final ballots are counted, we are confident they will affirm the results from Election Night,<U+201D><U+00A0>said Mr. Issa in a statement<U+00A0>Wednesday<U+00A0>night. The statement didn<U+2019>t say how many ballots remained to be counted. The California Secretary of State said 100% of the precincts had partially reported as of<U+00A0>Wednesday<U+00A0>evening. Mr. Issa, who was first elected to Congress in 2000, has been a staunch critic of President Barack Obama and a supporter of Mr. Trump. As chairman of a powerful House investigative committee for several years, he looked into a range of controversial actions and programs of the Obama administration, such as the Internal Revenue Service<U+2019>s treatment of nonprofits aligned with conservative causes. A close race had been expected for months. In the June primary, Mr. Issa won 50.8% of the vote just 5 percentage points ahead of Mr. Applegate. The 62-year-old Mr. Applegate was seen as a potentially more appealing candidate in the district than past Democratic opponents, in part because of his military background. The district is home to a major Marine base at Camp Pendleton. Though Orange and San Diego counties have long been bastions of Republican support, the GOP<U+2019>s position there has been eroding as California becomes increasingly dominated by Democratic and independent voters. Currently, all statewide officeholders are Democrats, as are the two U.S. senators. Democrats comprise majorities in California<U+2019>s congressional delegation and both houses of the state legislature. Write to John R. Emshwiller at john.emshwiller@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Regulators say AT&T <U+2019>s free-data offering for DirecTV violates net neutrality rules. But come January, the regulators may be out the door and those rules may be under threat. Last Thursday, AT&T received a letter from the Federal Communications Commission saying its practice of exempting its own video-streaming service from data-usage caps may violate net-neutrality rules. AT&T has until Nov. 21 to respond, and analysts say the FCC is likely to issue a final ruling halting the offering over the next couple months. But the election of Donald Trump last week has thrown the agency<U+2019>s willingness to uphold such a ruling into the air. That makes AT&T<U+2019>s position the most visible example of the speculation and uncertainty brewing over Mr. Trump<U+2019>s stance on net neutrality <U+2014>the signature issue of the Obama FCC. Most Republicans strongly oppose the agency<U+2019>s net-neutrality rules, which reclassified broadband internet service as a utility. And the market is betting that the Trump administration will appoint an FCC chairman who shares that view. Shares of Comcast have climbed 8.2% since Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory, while shares of Facebook , Netflix and Amazon.com <U+2014>internet companies that rely on access to broadband pipes<U+2014>have fallen 6.8%, 9.7% and 8.8%, respectively. But Mr. Trump has yet to lay out a clearly defined view of telecom policy. And while he has decried what he perceives as overregulation in some areas of government, he said last month his administration would block AT&T<U+2019>s proposed deal to buy Time Warner . <U+201C>I think he<U+2019>ll be a pro-business Republican with a populist tinge,<U+201D> said Paul Gallant, a regulatory analyst at Cowen. <U+201C>But right now, you don<U+2019>t know where the populism is going to show up.<U+201D> Companies are hoping a Trump administration at least ends some of the uncertainty that have surrounded the rules since they were issued. The current FCC said it would evaluate so-called zero-rating of data on a case-by-case basis to determine whether it complied with the rules. It apparently decided AT&T<U+2019>s plan to remove data caps for subscribers to its planned $35-a-month internet-TV service crossed a line, but it hasn<U+2019>t challenged similar offerings at Comcast or Verizon Communications . Still, even a cooperative Trump FCC might need to formally approve AT&T<U+2019>s data plan after last week<U+2019>s letter, a move likely to lead to outcry from internet companies and public interest groups. For telecom companies, the Trump card is still a wild card.",

Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said the various investigations into Mrs. Clinton had never proven consequential, and he suggested the probes involving him would result in the same outcome. Investigators are looking at whether the mayor exchanged government actions for donations , according to people familiar with the matter. These types of investigations into public officials, Mr. de Blasio said, are <U+201C>inevitable, real or imagined, fair or unfair.<U+201D> It is the <U+201C>reality of this work,<U+201D> he said. A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton didn<U+2019>t immediately respond to a request for comment. Mrs. Clinton has faced repeated questions on the campaign trail about her private email server and donations to the Clinton Foundation .

Mr. de Blasio, who served as Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign manager during her successful bid for U.S. Senate in New York in 2000, irritated her aides last year when he delayed his endorsement for six months and tried to plan a presidential forum that fizzled when no one agreed to attend. He has recently begun campaigning for her, going to Wisconsin last month and heading to Michigan this weekend.

        "original_post": "Donald Trump didn<U+2019>t talk much about financial regulation during his campaign, but when he did, he sent one consistent signal: He<U+2019>d like to rip up the landmark 2010 Dodd-Frank overhaul law that has shaped the postcrisis American financial system. <U+201C>We have to get rid of Dodd-Frank,<U+201D> he told Fox News in October 2015. <U+201C>The banks aren<U+2019>t loaning to people that need it,<U+201D> he added. <U+201C>The regulators are running the banks.<U+201D> It<U+2019>s unclear how high a priority that would actually rank in the Trump agenda. But it has long been a major focus for congressional Republicans. They<U+2019>ve been repeatedly stymied in their efforts by President Barack Obama and his aides, who have viewed Dodd-Frank as a pillar of their legacy. Having maintained control of both chambers , GOP lawmakers will likely try to move legislation targeting the act quickly through Congress<U+2014>expecting that this time, they won<U+2019>t face White House resistance. A top target for Republican lawmakers and their business allies is weakening the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a Dodd-Frank creation championed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.). The bureau<U+2019>s aggressive moves to rewrite the rules of American finance<U+2014>curbing high-dollar payday loans; banning banks for forcing disgruntled consumers into mandatory arbitration;<U+00A0> and cracking down on debt collectors<U+2014>have rankled a wide range of companies and creditors. And yet Mr. Trump has also expressed an ambivalence throughout the campaign toward the Wall Street establishment, which had clearly favored his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. During a January 2016 campaign swing through Iowa he said <U+201C>I<U+2019>m not going to let Wall Street get away with murder,<U+201D> though he never specified what, if anything, he would do. He also joined Mrs. Clinton in saying he would end what has long been seen as a loophole allowing hedge fund managers to pay a low tax rate on high earnings, although his tax plan could still allow them to avoid paying higher taxes. One other mystery for the financial industry: the platform of the July Republican convention that gave him the party<U+2019>s nomination included a call to restore the Depression-era Glass-Steagall law that would force a break-up of big banks. Mr. Trump himself has never endorsed a return of Glass-Steagall, and, in fact, once said he opposed breaking up the banks.

        "original_post": "Banks have rallied since the election, in part because investors think they might benefit from a lighter regulatory touch. A look at two of the people who could shape that policy shows that investors might be a bit too optimistic. Given President-elect Donald Trump <U+2019>s lack of experience and ever-changing positions, the people he puts in place are likely to exert significant influence on policy. One is Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and a potential candidate for Treasury secretary . Even if he stays in Congress, he will be instrumental in shaping any new bank legislation. Another person to watch is Thomas Hoenig, who is vice chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Mr. Hoenig<U+2019>s name has been making the rounds as a possible pick for Federal Reserve vice chairman for supervision. This regulatory role was never filled by President Barack Obama, but its duties have been de facto filled by Fed governor Daniel Tarullo. Both men have argued publicly that holding more loss-absorbing equity capital is the best way to make systemically important banks more resilient. Mr. Hensarling has proposed legislation that would exempt banks from a broad range of regulations in exchange for holding higher levels of capital. Specifically, he focuses on the <U+201C>leverage ratio<U+201D> of tangible equity to total assets plus off-balance-sheet exposures. This would be more stringent than the current regulatory standards, which measure capital against risk-weighted assets. To qualify for relief, Mr. Hensarling wants banks to maintain <U+201C>tangible equity,<U+201D> defined in the proposal as Tier 1 common equity plus preferred shares, equivalent to 10% of total assets and exposures. Calculations by The Wall Street Journal show that none of the six biggest banks in the U.S. would qualify for regulatory relief under this standard. Collectively, they would fall short by about $115 billion of equity capital. This estimate could undercount the amount of needed capital because it is based on total assets and doesn<U+2019>t take into account off-balance-sheet exposures. J.P. Morgan Chase is short by the most, about $44 billion. But Morgan Stanley <U+2019>s shortfall is biggest relative to its size, at 18% of its market capitalization. The need to issue shares or cut dividends and buybacks to get to the standard suggests they would hesitate to make the trade, even in exchange for substantial regulatory relief. Mr. Hoenig hasn<U+2019>t proposed anything so specific, but in speeches he has argued against lowering capital requirements for systemically important banks. He has also favored use of the more stringent leverage ratio and tangible equity capital. Mr. Hensarling<U+2019>s proposals cite Mr. Hoenig<U+2019>s arguments for inspiration. There are other reasons why big banks are rallying, including higher interest rates and trading volumes. But investors hoping for increased capital returns should temper expectations.

        "original_post": "On the campaign trail, President-elect Donald Trump talked tough on trade. But to judge from a rally in stocks, investors think these were idle threats. That is odd, given how critical Mr. Trump has been of trade policy . It is also surprising given how critical global trade is for most major U.S. companies. Whether trade restrictions help or hurt the U.S. economy, they likely would be very bad for stocks. Trade plays a massive role in the U.S. economy and for U.S. companies. Combined, exports and imports now amount to 27% of gross domestic product, versus 17% 30 years ago. S&P Dow Jones Indices calculates that companies in the S&P 500 generate about 44% of their sales abroad . Mr. Trump will have significant latitude on trade , including the power to terminate trade agreements without congressional approval. He appears set to push for substantial changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Likewise, Mr. Trump wouldn<U+2019>t need approval to significantly raise tariffs and impose quotas, though he could run into legal fights in the U.S. or at the World Trade Organization. For two centuries, economic theory has held that trade increases the size of the global economic pie. The problem is the gains from that growth are spread unevenly . The winners include U.S. companies that were able to substantially lower costs and boost profit margins. The losers include many of the blue-collar communities that supported Mr. Trump. Trade restrictions would hurt profits in multiple ways. Tariffs on imports would drive up costs for businesses and consumers that buy those products. Businesses might be forced to seek out domestic alternatives to their imports. This would drive up costs for companies such as Apple and Nike . Supply chains would be upended. Exporters such as Boeing could face retaliatory trade measures from other countries. Many U.S. companies are global players that rely on good economic relations with other countries. In 2014<U+2014>the last year with available Commerce Department data<U+2014>the majority-owned overseas affiliates of U.S. multinationals booked $4.1 trillion in sales. And at many multinationals, overseas operations count for the bulk of business. 3M , for example, booked 60% of its sales outside the U.S. in 2015. For McDonald<U+2019>s , it was 66%. For Colgate-Palmolive , 74%. Mr. Trump may be trying to win a few trade concessions and prompt manufacturers to add a bit more to their U.S. workforces. That appears to be what happened with Ford . But investors may want to think a little harder before putting too much stock in that rosy scenario. Write to Justin Lahart at justin.lahart@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "WASHINGTON<U+2014>President-elect Donald Trump is considering several retired military generals as possible picks to be secretary of defense, people knowledgeable about the transition process said. Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, a former war commander who has long voiced concerns about the security threat posed by Iran, is among those being considered. Gen. Mattis is expected to visit with Mr. Trump in New Jersey, transition officials said Friday. Gen. Mattis didn<U+2019>t respond to attempts to reach him for comment. Also under consideration is retired Army Gen. David Petraeus, a former commander of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Army Gen. Jack Keane, who has been advising the campaign, also has been in discussions and met with the president-elect on Thursday, transition officials said. The Trump campaign also is still considering at least three Washington hands for defense secretary, officials have said, including Jim Talent, a retired Republican senator from Missouri; Stephen Hadley, former national-security adviser under President George W. Bush; and Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.), a one-time Army captain from Arkansas who has served in the Senate since last year. The transition office, based at Trump Tower in New York, named individuals for key posts, including GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama for attorney general , Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas to lead the CIA , and retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, close Trump confidant on national security matters, as national security adviser . U.S. law requires the Defense Department chief to come from civilian life, and retired generals are considered civilians for such purposes only after they have been out of active duty for at least seven years. Gens. Mattis and Petraeus, who both played significant roles in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, would require a congressional waiver to serve as defense secretary, since both retired within the last seven years. Gen. Mattis, who eventually was in charge of U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East, has found himself at odds with the Obama administration over Iran and U.S. troop withdrawals from his area of responsibility. Gen. Mattis, who led a task force into southern Afghanistan in 2001 and a division of Marines during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, is also known as <U+201C>Mad Dog Mattis,<U+201D> a colorful general known for his intellect, a penchant for speaking plainly and his vast library.

        "original_post": "CLEVELAND <U+2014> With a single response in 1992 to a question about her legal career, Hillary Clinton became a radical feminist in her critics<U+2019> imagination, the Lady Macbeth who was an affront to the choices so many other women had made. <U+201C>I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession,<U+201D> she said during Bill Clinton<U+2019>s first presidential campaign. The blowback was intense and she spent weeks apologizing, saying that she respected women who chose to stay at home and raise children. Family Circle magazine invited her to and Barbara Bush to submit recipes for a chocolate-chip cookie bake-off, and she obliged. Mrs. Clinton would spend years trying to soften her image, to contort herself into the more traditional first lady persona of devoted wife and mother. But on Friday night, with Mrs. Clinton making her final push to become the first woman in the Oval Office, she did something no one could have expected her to do: She reclaimed the cookies line. In a multimedia explosion of hip-hop and girl power, with Beyonc<U+00E9> performing with a gaggle of backup dancers in blue pantsuits, Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s words from 24 years ago appeared on a giant screen above the stage. <U+201C>I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession,<U+201D> flashed on the screen. Signed: <U+201C>Hillary Clinton.<U+201D> It was a subtle but stunning moment for a candidate who has tried to play it safe in the final weeks of the presidential campaign. But it also perfectly fit Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s message that a victory for her would be a victory for all women, especially as she continues to hammer Donald J. Trump for his treatment of women. A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton said that the performers, who also included Jay Z, Chance the Rapper and Big Sean, had creative control of the concert, but that the campaign supported the signage. By the time Mrs. Clinton came on stage at the Wolstein Center to close out the get-out-the-vote rally here, her words had disappeared. She did not mention them; instead, Mrs. Clinton quoted Jay Z. <U+201C>Jay memorably said something we should all recall: Rosa Parks sat so Martin Luther could walk and Martin Luther walked so Barack Obama could run and Barack Obama ran so all the children could fly,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>Well, we have unfinished business to do,<U+201D> she continued. <U+201C>More barriers to break and, with your help, a glass ceiling to crack once and for all.<U+201D> Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook , Twitter and the Morning Briefing newsletter .",

Donald Trump <U+2019>s election victory surprisingly hasn<U+2019>t stopped gun enthusiasts from stocking up yet. More background checks for gun transactions were processed on Black<U+00A0>Friday than any other single day, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Its data set goes back nearly two decades. But that doesn<U+2019>t change what is likely going to be more difficult times ahead for gun makers, including Smith & Wesson Holding Corp. The nation<U+2019>s largest gun maker by sales is set to report fiscal second-quarter earnings<U+00A0>on Thursday. Results should be strong, continuing a string of impressive quarterly performances. Analysts forecast earnings for the period ended in October of 57 cents a share, up from 25 cents a year earlier. Revenue is expected to have more than doubled to $228 million.<U+00A0>The stock is prone to sharp post-results moves, including several double-digit percentage swings in recent years. For Smith & Wesson, it is the outlook that could be concerning.<U+00A0>Gun sales tend to surge when people are most fearful of politicians imposing new firearm restrictions. That was the case when it was assumed that Hillary Clinton would win the presidency. But those tighter restrictions likely won<U+2019>t happen under Mr. Trump, who was endorsed by the National Rifle Association. Not surprisingly, Smith & Wesson<U+2019>s stock was one of the biggest losers immediately following the election. It shed one-fourth of its value in the three trading days after Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory.<U+00A0>A gun-friendly Republican administration could take an immediate toll on gun makers. Analysts at Wunderlich Securities predict background checks, which have been increasing all year, might turn negative as soon as December. November<U+2019>s full-month registration figures are expected to be released this week. Granted, Smith & Wesson isn<U+2019>t sitting still. It plans to change its name and ticker symbol , rebranding itself as American Outdoor Brands Corp. That is a nod to how it has diversified into<U+00A0>the larger recreational and outdoor-sports market by acquiring makers of hunting knives, flashlights and camping equipment. But branding can go only so far. Smith & Wesson skeptics have been smelling opportunity for months. Short interest, a proxy for investors betting against a stock, has more than doubled since the beginning of the year, recently hitting 21% of shares outstanding. That is the highest since January 2015. Don<U+2019>t be surprised if Smith & Wesson bulls get even more gun-shy. Write to Steven Russolillo at steven.russolillo@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "STERLING HEIGHTS, Mich.<U+2014>Michigan has emerged as the unexpected epicenter of the presidential campaign during the run-up to Election Day, with Hillary Clinton defending her Democratic turf and Donald Trump making an aggressive play for this blue-tinged state. Michigan, once viewed as essentially out of reach for the Republican presidential nominee, has resurfaced as a closely contested battleground . The presidential candidates and their A-list surrogates are fanning out across the state, making it one of their last stops as they sprint toward the finish. Mr. Trump campaigned<U+00A0>Sunday night<U+00A0>in this Detroit suburb, predicting a win in Michigan and declaring, <U+201C>the unions love me.<U+201D> <U+201C>The economic policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton have bled Michigan dry,<U+201D> he told a massive crowd at an outdoor amphitheater. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s running mate, Mike Pence, has scheduled two campaign events in Michigan on Monday. Meantime, both Mrs. Clinton and President Barack Obama plan to campaign separately Monday in the state. Polls still show Mrs. Clinton with a single-digit edge there, but Mr. Trump has gained ground during the last couple of weeks. On Sunday, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus characterized Michigan as <U+201C> an absolute tossup .<U+201D> <U+201C>When you look at a place like Michigan, where jobs have gone to Mexico and China and people are out of work and people want things to get better, I think Donald Trump is offering that vision for the state of Michigan,<U+201D> Mr. Priebus told ABC. In a state with a large share of white, working-class voters, the Trump campaign sees an opportunity to score an upset and expand the New York businessman<U+2019>s narrow path to the White House. With African-American turnout lagging in early voting in some other parts of the country, Mrs. Clinton is redoubling efforts to turn out her base in a state that has voted for Democrats in the last six presidential elections. And after being blindsided by Sen. Bernie Sanders<U+2019> upset win in Michigan during the Democratic primaries, the Clinton campaign isn<U+2019>t taking this state for granted. But with limited absentee voting ahead of Election Day in Michigan, the two campaigns have fewer tea leaves to read here than in other states that have much broader parameters for early voting. John Podesta, Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s campaign chairman, said Sunday that if the former secretary of state keeps Michigan and Nevada in her column, she would win the White House. <U+201C>We feel like we got a lead in Michigan,<U+201D> he told NBC. <U+201C>We want to hold on to it, and we think we can do that.<U+201D> <U+2014>David Harrison contributed to this article.

        "original_post": "When Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India was seeking office more than two years ago, one of his favorite sayings was, <U+201C>Ab ki baar, Modi sarkar,<U+201D> or, <U+201C>This time, a Modi government.<U+201D> Now, Donald Trump and some die-hard supporters are using that very slogan in a new TV ad , in Hindi no less, to try to win over voters of Indian descent. The ad, which is running on Indian TV channels in the United States, is a slapdash affair featuring clips of Mr. Trump at a recent Bollywood-themed event in Edison, N.J., called <U+201C> Humanity United Against Terror ,<U+201D> held by the Republican Hindu Coalition. The ad also features an image from a 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai, a smiling Mr. Modi and Mr. Trump proclaiming, <U+201C>We love the Hindus.<U+201D> The highlight, though, has to be Mr. Trump reciting Mr. Modi<U+2019>s slogan but with his name, instead of Mr. Modi<U+2019>s. It<U+2019>s not surprising that he would go after Indian voters. They are one of the most affluent and well-educated ethnic groups in the country, according to a new book . And many of them are big fans of Mr. Modi, who, like Mr. Trump, projects himself as a strong leader who can keep people safe from terrorists and turbocharge the economy. But when it comes to American politics, a large majority of them support Hillary Clinton, in part because Indian-Americans have suffered from the kind of racial animus in which Mr. Trump traffics. The National Asian American Survey released earlier this month found that registered Indian-American voters supported Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump by 67 percent to 7 percent. It will take a lot more for Mr. Trump to win them over than cribbing from Mr. Modi and speaking broken Hindi.

        "original_post": "U.S. defense stocks rallied Wednesday as the prospect of a short-term bump in military spending from the incoming Trump administration outweighed concerns about a possible hit to export sales. Republican control of Congress is expected to pave the way for an increase in the Pentagon<U+2019>s war fund to tackle conflicts in the Middle East, though President-elect Donald Trump hasn<U+2019>t laid out plans for how he would fund pledges to boost the size of the Army, expand the Navy fleet or add more combat jets. Lockheed Martin Corp. shares gained 6%. Raytheon Co. added 7.5%, and Northrop Grumman Corp. advanced 5.4%, as both hit all-time highs. Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. led the charge with a rise of 11.4%. Both main presidential candidates had championed further single-digit increases in the domestic military budget, with Mr. Trump pushing for U.S. allies to boost their spending. Analysts have expressed concern that his election could hit American defense exports, notably to Islamic nations. Publicly, defense executives largely steered clear of election commentary to champion the need for increases and stability in spending, with the Pentagon likely to work under temporary budgets until early next year. Defense executives met with Mr. Trump in June through the Aerospace Industries Association, their main trade group, which Wednesday emphasized the need for more stability in setting military budgets. Republican control of Congress also is expected to accelerate the push for faster reforms of the way the Pentagon buys weapons, analysts said. Boeing Co, which derives a third of its sales from defense, ended 2% higher. Analysts questioned whether it would be able to tie up a proposed 100-jet sale to Iran before the end of the year, given the president-elect has pledged to make over the nuclear treaty that paved the way for the plane maker to open talks. Boeing declined to comment. Write to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "If you think policing for profit is a bad idea in ordinary law enforcement, imagine what it can do to free speech. That<U+2019>s the experiment headed for the ballot in Washington, where an initiative would put the state<U+2019>s speech police on a commission, allowing campaign regulators to keep a percentage of fines they collect. Under ballot measure 1464, the Washington state Public Disclosure Commission would be eligible to receive half of the civil penalties it assesses for state campaign-finance violations. The agency would also get a 50% cut of awards from cases it refers to the state attorney general. Putting any enforcement agency on a commission is dangerous, but especially one that regulates political speech. This would give regulators a financial stake in going after as many potential petty violations as possible in hopes the percentages will pay off in the department<U+2019>s budget. This is part of the initiative<U+2019>s broader plan to tighten speech regulations, including a presumption of coordination that would force citizens to rebut the suggestion that their independent expenditures were coordinated with a candidate. According to the ballot measure, <U+201C>[a]n expenditure in support of a candidate or opposing a candidate<U+2019>s opponent . . . is presumed to be made in coordination with that candidate or the candidate<U+2019>s agent<U+201D> if, for instance, a candidate and the person making the expenditure attended a meeting together as much as two years before the expenditure was made. The plan would also make it easier for private citizens<U+2014>i.e., activists financed by the likes of George Soros <U+2014>to take people to court for campaign-finance violations and let them collect attorneys<U+2019> fees. The law would also give voters vouchers worth up to $50 to donate to state legislative candidates. Yes, taxpayer subsidies for politicians. The Washington measure is part of the national progressive effort to limit speech using campaign-finance law. Elizabeth Warren wants the feds to impose new rules, and Hillary Clinton wants to rewrite the First Amendment. Now is the time for voters to object, while they still can.",

Gary Cohn, Goldman<U+2019>s president and chief operating officer, was among those set to meet with the president-elect Tuesday, the Trump campaign said. It isn<U+2019>t clear whether Mr. Trump is considering Mr. Cohn for a job or simply soliciting his advice. Joining the administration would give Mr. Cohn, who has been heir apparent for most of the past decade, an exit strategy should Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein remain in his job for the foreseeable future. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs didn<U+2019>t immediately comment. A spokesman for Mr. Trump wasn<U+2019>t immediately available to comment. Mr. Cohn is a Republican donor, having given $72,500 this cycle to the national party committee and candidates including Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Mr. Blankfein said he was supporting<U+00A0>Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Mr. Cohn, 56 years old, said earlier this month that he wasn<U+2019>t surprised by Mr. Trump<U+2019>s win because it followed other outcomes, such as<U+00A0>Brexit, where polls had been wrong. Mr. Cohn, who grew up in Ohio and started his career with U.S. Steel in Cleveland, told CNBC that given his <U+201C>Midwestern context<U+201D> he <U+201C>had a feeling that we may end up in this situation.<U+201D> <U+201C>We<U+2019>re all giving President Trump and his transition team the benefit of the doubt,<U+201D> Mr. Cohn said in the televised interview. Mr. Trump was highly critical of Goldman during his campaign, criticizing Ms. Clinton for receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars for speeches given to the firm and its clients. A Trump television ad showed Mr. Blankfein at a Clinton Global Initiative event and accused Ms. Clinton of secret meetings with global banks <U+201C>to plot the destruction of US sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends and her donors.<U+201D> However, one of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s closest advisors, Stephen Bannon is a former Goldman banker.

        "original_post": "No matter how Tuesday<U+2019>s<U+00A0>election shakes out, the markets aren<U+2019>t likely to sit still. Stocks have a history of sharp moves in the trading day following presidential elections. Should that pattern continue, investors might be better off ignoring them. Initial reactions often have been misleading. In 1932, when Franklin D. Roosevelt was first elected, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 4.5% the following day. Yet the market roared higher in the year that followed. Similarly, the Dow fell 3.8% after Harry Truman <U+2019>s surprise victory over Republican Thomas Dewey in 1948. The market finished up that year. More recently, President Barack Obama <U+2019>s two victories in 2008 and 2012 sparked drops of 5.3% and 2.4%, respectively. Yet Mr. Obama has presided over one of the best bull markets in history. The market clearly is nervous over whether the next occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue will be Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. The S&P 500 through<U+00A0>Friday<U+00A0>logged its longest stretch of declines in 36 years . The change in election odds over the past several days suggests that the prospect of a Trump victory worries markets more than the prospect of Mrs. Clinton, the status-quo candidate, prevailing. But, in the latter case, investors might soon turn their attention to higher interest rates coming as soon as next month, which could once again roil markets. Stocks have rallied following elections, too. In 2004, George W. Bush <U+2019>s re-election prompted a 1% rally, but the market did poorly during that term. Conversely, Bill Clinton <U+2019>s re-election in 1996 prompted the Dow to jump 1.6% and the tech-fueled bull market continued until the last several months of that term. The major indexes are still clinging to slim year-to-date gains.<U+00A0>Since 1950, the S&P 500 has averaged a 2.5% rise in the final two months of election years and has been higher three-fourths of the time, according to Ryan Detrick at LPL Financial. The wild card, though, is this being the eighth year a president has been in office. They are notoriously weak for stocks. The financial crisis in 2008 is the most recent and stark example. As Brexit taught investors<U+2014>stocks slid 5.3%<U+00A0>in two days<U+00A0>but recovered within two weeks<U+2014> the first reaction isn<U+2019>t necessarily the right reaction . Corrections & Amplifications: The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 4.5% the trading day after Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected in 1932. A photo caption on an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated it fell 4.5% the day he was elected. (Nov. 8, 2016) Write to Steven Russolillo at steven.russolillo@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "RIO DE JANEIRO<U+2014>Brazilian economic officials on Monday reinforced calls for fiscal discipline to rekindle the country<U+2019>s troubled economy, as the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president added uncertainty to emerging markets. Speaking at separate events, Brazil<U+2019>s central bank president, Ilan Goldfajn, and Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles said that plugging a widening budget hole is key to restoring confidence, taming inflation and getting Latin America<U+2019>s largest economy out of its worst recession on record. <U+201D>Increasing inflation to finance public spending is no longer an option, <U+201C> Mr. Goldfajn told business leaders gathered in Rio de Janeiro. <U+201C>Laws of fiscal adjustments are necessary.<U+201D> Brazil<U+2019>s Congress is considering public-spending limits for at least the next 10 years. A final vote in the Senate is expected next month. Other potentially controversial measures, including changes to Brazil<U+2019>s generous retirement system, are expected for next year. The measure represents a U-turn for a government that is used to expanding its costs faster than inflation for more than a decade and is facing headwinds among voters. The administration of President Michel Temer, who took over in August after former President Dilma Rousseff was ousted for alleged budget crimes, is trying to appease austerity critics by arguing it is the only way to resume growth. <U+201C>Fixing public-accounts deterioration is a prerequisite for the economy to grow again,<U+201D> Mr. Meirelles told business leaders in Bras<U+00ED>lia. Brazil<U+2019>s economy is forecast to contract 3.4% this year, according to a central-bank survey of economists released earlier Monday. The central bank last month cut its benchmark Selic rate to 14% from 14.25%, the first rate cut in four years, as prices weakened and the two-year recession showed no signs of relief. Consumer prices rose at a 7.9% annual pace in October, well above the official 4.5% target. Analysts expect another rate cut on Nov. 30, but that prospect has been shaken by Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election. Among other things, economists say that if the new U.S. administration pushes for economic stimulus, as promised during the campaign, that could lead to higher borrowing costs in the U.S., which could slow down the pace of monetary easing in Brazil. <U+201D>The result of the American election is another element of uncertainty,<U+201D> Mr. Goldfajn said. <U+2014>Priscilla Oliveira contributed in this article Write to Paulo Trevisani at paulo.trevisani@wsj.com",

Bush, including during the first Gulf War. He said he has spoken to Mr. Trump since his surprise election victory on Nov. 8. Mr. Quayle said that he believes Mr. Trump will favor working with leaders of authoritarian governments, including Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi. <U+201C>He seems to like the tough people. He likes to deal with people who have authority and that can bring stability, like General Sisi of Egypt,<U+201D> Mr. Quayle said. <U+201C>Everyone talks about this rising nationalism. Authoritarian regimes have been emboldened in the last five or six years, very much so, around the world.<U+201D> Mr. Trump spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone on Monday . The Kremlin said Mr. Putin congratulated Mr. Trump on his election victory. Mr. Quayle said that Mr. Putin has been <U+201C>very flattering<U+201D> to Mr. Trump and that the two leaders will likely start on good terms. However, relations between them are likely to be tested by conflicts including in Ukraine and Syria, he said. <U+201C>There are some very contentious issues and once Putin crosses Donald Trump or misleads him or doesn<U+2019>t live up to what he thinks he is then it will be a new situation, because Donald Trump values loyalty very much,<U+201D> Mr. Quayle said. The former vice president was speaking at the SuperInvestor private-equity conference in Amsterdam. He is a senior executive at Cerberus Capital Management LP, a New York-based private-equity firm with more than $30 billion under management. Mr. Quayle said that there is a <U+201C>big difference<U+201D> between deal making in business and in politics. Mr. Trump may not yet be aware of the difference, he said. In business, people execute contacts that have been agreed, but in politics people often try to <U+201C>undo<U+201D> agreements even after they are signed, he said. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s going to be very interesting how he adapts to his orders not<U+00A0>being necessarily carried out,<U+201D> Mr. Quayle said. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory was spurred by a backlash against globalization , and can be compared to the U.K. vote to leave the European Union, known as Brexit , Mr. Quayle said. <U+201C>Whether it<U+2019>s Brexit in the U.K. or Donald Trump winning the election in the United States what it<U+2019>s saying is that the system is not working,<U+201D> Mr. Quayle said. <U+201C>Too many people have been left behind,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>If nationalism makes us rethink where we are today and reorganize and discuss some new arrangements, so be it.<U+201D> Write to Simon Clark at simon.clark@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "BRUSSELS<U+2014>The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has appointed its first intelligence chief, a post designed to help the alliance improve information sharing and counterterrorism coordination. Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee who has repeatedly criticized NATO for too little focus on countering terrorism, said that the creation of the new post shows the alliance taking steps to react to his criticism. Officials said Friday that alliance Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is appointing Arndt Freytag von Loringhoven of Germany as assistant secretary-general for intelligence and security. Officials have said much of the initial work of the new assistant secretary-general for intelligence will focus on improving intelligence sharing focused on Russia<U+2019>s military buildup as well as addressing duplication in civilian and military intelligence efforts. But officials have said the new post could also help improve counterterrorism intelligence sharing<U+2014>pushing NATO into an area often left to bilateral cooperation. NATO officials have denied that the intelligence post was created in response to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s criticisms. A longtime diplomat and currently the German ambassador to the Czech Republic, Mr. von Loringhoven, served as vice president of Germany<U+2019>s Federal Intelligence Service from 2007 to 2010. While some U.S. officials in Washington had pushed for an American holding the job, the U.S. now has the deputy secretary-general post as well as another assistant position. Alliance officials had sought a civilian for the post, preferably one with experience in military intelligence. The new post will oversee both the civilian intelligence analysts who provide information to the secretary-general and NATO ambassadors, as well as uniformed analysts who work for NATO<U+2019>s military committee. NATO<U+2019>s counterintelligence operations, aimed at preventing Russian infiltration of the alliance, will also report to the new assistant secretary-general, officials have said. Dylan White, the acting NATO spokesman, said the intelligence chief will lead a new division of both civilian and military staff. <U+201C>All the challenges we face have an intelligence dimension, including terrorism, hybrid warfare and our operations,<U+201D> Mr. White said. The new intelligence chief will face hurdles combining the civilian and military intelligence cultures. An even bigger hurdle could be prodding allies including France to allow NATO to have a larger role in counterterrorism. Paris has been pushing for the EU, rather than NATO, to have more of a coordinating role in counterterrorism matters. Still, NATO has advantages, especially with the pending British exit from the EU. Britain has some of the strongest intelligence on terrorism threats to Europe, as does the U.S. and Turkey, neither of which belong to the EU. Officials said the new intelligence chief is likely to focus on higher-level intelligence sharing about Islamic State<U+2019>s strategy and operations, rather than tactical details of specific people trying to infiltrate into Europe.

        "original_post": "BRUSSELS<U+2014>Negotiations on a sweeping trade pact between the European Union and the U.S. will be put on hold for a long time following the result of the U.S. election, the bloc<U+2019>s top trade official said on Friday. Speaking after a regular meeting of trade ministers in Brussels, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr<U+00F6>m said there was no plan to hold any further negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP. <U+201C>I think we should be realistic, I don<U+2019>t see the resumption of any TTIP negotiations in quite a long time,<U+201D> Ms. Malmstr<U+00F6>m said. The world<U+2019>s two biggest economic blocs have been negotiating TTIP since 2013, and have repeatedly said they hope to conclude negotiations before the end of the Obama administration in January. But prospects for completing the deal have suffered from weakening political support in Europe as well as growing public criticism, as anti-globalization sentiment has gained traction on both sides of the Atlantic. The election of Donald Trump, who employed a strong antitrade rhetoric throughout his campaign, has dealt a further blow to prospects for the already struggling agreement. <U+201C>For quite some time TTIP will probably be in the freezer and what will happen when it is defrosted I think we need to wait an see,<U+201D> Ms. Malmstr<U+00F6>m said. Throughout his campaign, Mr. Trump lambasted existing and planned trade deals, arguing that they hurt U.S. workers and the country<U+2019>s competitiveness. European officials have long expected that if Mr. Trump won the election, TTIP would be all but dead, given the strong opposition he voiced against to global trade deals. But they also stressed that his views on TTIP specifically weren<U+2019>t known, as his criticism was chiefly directed at the Trans Pacific Partnership, or TPP, a trade pact among the U.S., Japan, Canada, Australia and eight other countries around the Pacific. <U+201C>He has not, one single time in his election campaign, made any reference to TTIP, so we do not know what he thinks on it,<U+201D> Ms. Malmstr<U+00F6>m said. In the U.S., TTIP has largely been under the public<U+2019>s radar, but strong criticism by presidential candidates of the recently agreed TPP underscores the lack of appetite and possible resistance to similar deals. Peter Ziga, the Slovakian economy minister who presided over the ministers meeting, said the EU remained open to dialogue, but that the next step in negotiations will need to be assessed once the new U.S. administration is in place. <U+201C>The ball is on the U.S. side,<U+201D> he said. But he added that, <U+201C>at the moment we don<U+2019>t know if we have someone on the other side of the table.<U+201D> The trans-Atlantic talks have generated more widespread disapproval in Europe than in Washington, where the Obama administration has struggled to get the TPP deal through Congress. Britain<U+2019>s vote to leave the EU has added further uncertainty for negotiators on both sides, as it means the loss of one of the bloc<U+2019>s strongest trade advocates and one of the largest economies originally expected be part of the pact.

And shares of Amazon.com , which Mr. Trump claimed was avoiding taxes and whose chief executive he accused of abusing his power as owner of the Washington Post, fell 3%. While the Republican candidate<U+2019>s campaign was unique for many reasons, it was particularly noteworthy for Mr. Trump<U+2019>s propensity to lash out at perceived critics<U+2014>even when those critics happened to be corporations. He also frequently spoke his mind about corporate practices that went against his populist, protectionist message.

        "original_post": "Wall Street<U+2019>s <U+201C>fear gauge<U+201D> on Wednesday tumbled the most since 2011, a swift reversal from late trading on Election Day, when futures on the equity volatility index surged higher . November futures on the CBOE Volatility Index jumped 47% to 23.46 in after-hours trading Tuesday as vote tallies showed Republican Donald Trump leading Democratic Hillary Clinton in key swing states in the U.S. presidential race. At about midnight in New York, S&P 500 e-mini futures sank as much as 5%, triggering a threshold designed to halt deeper declines. But Wednesday morning, after Mr. Trump clinched the shock win , trading was calmer. Stocks and other risky assets recovered from steep losses. The CBOE index known as VIX, which tracks expectations for stock market turbulence, sank 23% to 14.38, its biggest retreat since Aug. 9, 2011 and the lowest level in two weeks. <U+201C>You will see a dampening in volatility over the next few days and weeks,<U+201D> said Drew Forman, co-head of sales and trading at Macro Risk Advisors. People had set up bets against volatility heading into the election and continue to do so, which would mute stock market turmoil going forward, he said. The VIX is calculated using options on the S&P 500 stock index. The gauge notched a record nine-day stretch of gains through Friday, propelled by increased uncertainty about who would win the election. <U+201C>Part of the question is now how much of the trading has already been done,<U+201D> said Rocky Fishman, equity-derivatives strategist for Deutsche Bank . <U+201C>When VIX futures are already in the 20s, will people add to that position or will there be profit-taking?<U+201D> Trading on VIX futures climbed to a record of more than 260,000 contracts through extended trading hours, breaking the prior high of about 235,000 set after Brexit, according to a spokeswoman at CBOE Holdings Inc., which operates the VIX. The VIX<U+2019>s drop today also differs from the 49% surge the measure posted June 24, one day after the unexpected vote by Britain to exit from the European Union. Back then, the S&P 500 index plunged 5% over two days before recovering in the next several days. Investors will certainly remember the parallels to the Brexit aftermath when volatility collapsed very quickly the following week, Fishman said.

        "original_post": "LONDON<U+2014>Copper prices hit a 17-month high on Thursday morning in London as bullish expectations for manufacturing spending outweighed the dollar hitting multiyear highs. The three-month London Metal Exchange copper contract was up 1.27% at $5,842 a metric ton in midmorning trade in Europe, the highest price since mid-June 2015. On Wednesday, the metal closed at a 16-month high in New York trading after U.S. durable goods data showed a 4.8% jump, the highest in a year, stoking further expectations of higher demand for the metal. American markets will be closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving. On Thursday, the WSJ Dollar Index, which weighs the dollar against a basket of other currencies, was up 0.07%, building on a 14-year high on Wednesday. A stronger dollar is typically bearish for dollar-denominated commodities, because it makes them more expensive for buyers who hold other currencies. But copper<U+2019>s rally<U+2014>which began before the U.S. presidential election on the back of signs of strengthening Chinese demand and then picked up further momentum following Donald Trump <U+2019>s win<U+2014>has so far shaken off the strong dollar. <U+201C>These are unprecedented moves,<U+201D> said Matt France, head of institutional sales for Asia at brokerage Marex Spectron. <U+201C>Global money managers are starting to put Dr. Copper back on their trading screens,<U+201D> he said, stoking further bullish momentum. That appetite for the metal could extend into the new year, Mr. France added. Other analysts were more skeptical that the pace of the rally could be sustained. <U+201C>I think the danger is [copper] has run ahead of itself,<U+201D> said William Adams, head of research at FastMarkets in London, who added that copper would likely see profit-taking ahead of the weekend. The metal is also in the midst of a <U+201C>catch up<U+201D> rally, Mr. Adams said. For most of the year, copper lagged behind the double-digit year-to-date gains in the other base metals. Copper is now up roughly 25% so far in 2016, surpassing aluminum and clocking roughly the same gains as lead, but the red metal is still trailing the sharp gains in the other base metals, particularly nickel and tin. The other base metals were mixed on Thursday afternoon. Aluminum was down 0.51% at $1,770 per ton, lead was up 0.07% at $2,239 per ton, zinc was down 0.24% at $2,699.50 a ton, nickel was down 0.13% at $11,615 a ton, and tin was flat at $21,285 a ton.

        "original_post": "For the stock market, the next few weeks through Election Day could look a bit like a fox trot: Slow, slow, quick, quick. Rarely have investors been so confident of what a presidential election <U+2019>s results will be as they are now. But rarely have the consequences of being wrong been so high. Hillary Clinton, the status-quo candidate, is meaningfully ahead in the polls . But if Donald Trump, who is running a highly unconventional campaign and doesn<U+2019>t come from the establishment, won, it could create a highly uncertain situation. Put differently, Mr. Trump is a tail risk<U+2014>something investors don<U+2019>t think will happen, but would matter a lot if it did. There is a tail risk on the other side, too : If Democrats are able to capture not just the Senate, but the House, Mrs. Clinton would face few road blocks to enacting her agenda. Investors<U+2019> solution: Stop trading and take out a little protection. Stock-market trading volumes are unusually low. Prices of index options (which act as insurance against market swings) expiring right after the election are notably higher than options expiring right before it. It isn<U+2019>t all that different than what investors do in front of other binary events such as Federal Reserve meetings where the chances of a rate increase are low, says Pravit Chintawongvanich, head derivatives strategist at Macro Risk Advisors. The difference is that being wrong on an unexpected election outcome could be a lot worse than being wrong on an unexpected rate increase. But when risk events pass, and the unexpected thing doesn<U+2019>t happen, investors can be both relieved and have a lot of catching up to do. The day after Election Day should be interesting.

        "original_post": "GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump took home a crucial victory in Florida, a triumph that carries 29 electoral votes and creates several paths for him to win the White House. Mr. Trump was declared the winner with 49.2% of the vote, when the Associated Press called the race with 99% of precincts reporting. His win signals his strength with white, working-class voters in a state that has grown increasingly racially diverse and illustrates how the billionaire businessman might take home more victories in other battlegrounds. In the final two months of the campaign, both candidates placed outsize significance on the Sunshine State, with more campaign stops and ad dollars spent there than any other presidential battleground in the country. By most conventional measures, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton held an advantage throughout the race. Her campaign outspent Mr. Trump<U+2019>s on television advertising nearly every week and opened at least twice as many field offices in Florida. The state<U+2019>s growing population of Hispanic voters was also expected to cast ballots in record numbers this year, likely favoring Mrs. Clinton, in response to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s derogatory comments about immigrants and minority groups. Polls of the state, however, showed Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s advantage narrowing over the campaign<U+2019>s final few weeks, raising questions about whether fervor for Mr. Trump<U+2019>s candidacy could drive more voters to the polls than Mrs. Clinton<U+2019>s methodical, data-driven approach.",

        "original_post": "President-elect Donald Trump is considering former GOP presidential candidate and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson for the head of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, a spokesman for Mr. Carson said. On Wednesday, Mr. Carson suggested on Facebook that he would join the Trump administration, reversing his stance last week that he didn<U+2019>t want to work in government. <U+201C>After serious discussions with the Trump transition team, I feel that I can make a significant contribution particularly to making our inner cities great for everyone,<U+201D> Mr. Carson said. <U+201C>An announcement is forthcoming about my role in helping to make America great again.<U+201D> But several hours after the Facebook post was written, Carson spokesman Armstrong Williams said Mr. Carson was still considering the HUD opportunity and that no decision had been made. Aside from his presidential run, Mr. Carson doesn<U+2019>t have much political experience. Still, he won over many conservative voters with his positive, even-mannered style. He was born and raised in Detroit, and, after he dropped out of the presidential race, he appeared to develop a friendship with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump tweeted on Tuesday that he was <U+201C>seriously considering<U+201D> Mr. Carson for the HUD post, adding that <U+201C>he<U+2019>s a greatly talented person who loves people!<U+201D> HUD, with a budget of $47.9 billion and some 8,400 employees, has played a critical role in stabilizing the housing market after last decade<U+2019>s boom and bust. Through the Federal Housing Administration, which is part of HUD, the federal government currently insures one in every six new home-purchase mortgages. HUD also oversees funding for about 1.2 million low-income households in public-housing units managed by some 3,300 local housing agencies. Under the Obama administration, the department has beefed up enforcement of fair-housing regulations to combat zoning policies that result in segregation, threatening the loss of millions of dollars in federal funding to municipalities that don<U+2019>t comply. Mr. Carson sharply criticized those policies as <U+201C>mandated social-engineering schemes<U+201D> that repeated a pattern of <U+201C>failed socialist experiments in this country,<U+201D> in a 2015 op-ed published in The Washington Times. Mr. Carson<U+2019>s possible nomination would be <U+201C>surprising and concerning given his lack of experience with or knowledge of the programs he would oversee,<U+201D> said Diane Yentel, chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a housing advocacy organization, on Wednesday. In the Obama administration, the department was headed by Shaun Donovan, who previously served as New York City<U+2019>s housing commissioner, and Juli<U+00E1>n Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio. Corrections & Amplifications: President-elect Donald Trump is considering Ben Carson to be the next secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Politicians like Hillary Clinton have responded to the message of Black Lives Matter by vigorously agreeing that all Americans have a problem of <U+201C>implicit bias,<U+201D> if not worse. But on this issue the politicians seem to be way out of step with the people. While Gallup finds rising support for local police across all demographics, the biggest surge in respect for America<U+2019>s men and women in blue is occurring among political liberals. People in this category expressing a great deal of respect for police shot up to 71% this year from 50% in 2015.

Elizabeth Warren, a hero on the populist left, joined Hillary Clinton on Monday to push her presidential bid and the progressive agenda that she expects the Democratic nominee to carry with her should she win the White House. Speaking at an event in New Hampshire, the senator from neighboring Massachusetts ticked through her priorities, including a major new federal program to subsidize college tuition, new regulations on Wall Street and an expanded Social Security program. Mrs. Clinton voiced much of that agenda, too, but also noted her outreach to Republicans and independents, citing the endorsement of 150 New Hampshire Republicans. <U+201C>We are more than our disagreements, we are Americans,<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>There is so much more that unites us than divides us.<U+201D> But even if Mrs. Clinton is elected, she might find it harder to win Republican votes for a liberal policy agenda than it has been winning some Republicans over to her presidential bid.

Overall, the new rules give Mr. Hammond more room for borrowing<U+2014>of up to 2.5% of gross domestic product in fiscal 2020<U+2014>versus the old targets, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the official fiscal watchdog, says. He is using some of that to boost spending on infrastructure . But the bigger hit to the public finances comes from changes in the OBR<U+2019>s economic forecasts, mostly due to the effects of Brexit, which is expected to damp trade, lower investment and reduce potential growth. Mr. Hammond<U+2019>s fiscal wiggle room has already been diminished by that. The OBR says borrowing over the next five years will be <U+00A3>122 billion ($151.11 billion) higher than previously forecast; debt is set to peak at 90.2% of GDP in 2017. And Brexit poses further risks. The OBR forecasts that after slowing to 1.4% in 2017 as inflation crimps incomes and investment stalls, growth will pick back up swiftly, reaching 2.1% in 2019 and 2020. The U.K. economy has displayed welcome resilience in recent months, but uncertainty about its post-Brexit future is high. The OBR<U+2019>s take is relatively optimistic. Debt, deficit and growth outcomes could yet be markedly different. If the U.K. economy hits trouble, there could be more fiscal largess. But right now, this isn<U+2019>t the reflation trade that investors might have been looking for. Write to Richard Barley at richard.barley@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "A judge has scheduled a Monday morning hearing to consider the Philadelphia-area transit agency<U+2019>s request for the court to end a transit workers<U+2019> strike that has halted bus, subway and trolley service within the city since Tuesday. On Friday, Philadelphia Common Pleas Judge Linda Carpenter denied a preliminary injunction sought by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority. The transit agency claims the work stoppage jeopardizes citizens<U+2019> right to vote this Tuesday and poses a <U+201C>clear and present danger to the health, safety and welfare of our riders and the citizens of Philadelphia and the region.<U+201D> SEPTA routes outside the city continue to operate, as does regional rail service through the city and the suburbs. Judge Carpenter ruled there wasn<U+2019>t sufficient evidence to support SEPTA<U+2019>s claims and set a hearing for Monday at 9:30 a.m. on whether <U+201C>any immediate irreparable harm to the welfare of the public<U+201D> will result if the strike were to continue past Monday. Lawyers for Transport Workers Union Local 234 oppose judicial intervention, and a spokesman said the union wants SEPTA to continue bargaining on a new contract. Sticking points include pension benefits and health insurance coverage. SEPTA, the nation<U+2019>s sixth-largest transit agency, said in court papers that city residents, especially the elderly and disabled, won<U+2019>t be able to use public transit to go between polling places and their homes or workplaces if the strike isn<U+2019>t over by Tuesday. <U+201C>In addition, as a result of the strike, citizens who plan to vote in the evening cannot rely on SEPTA to get them home from work in a timely and predictable manner,<U+201D> agency lawyers wrote. Pollsters say lower turnout in Philadelphia could hurt Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who is counting on a wide margin of victory in the city to help her carry Pennsylvania. SEPTA also said the strike is causing people to miss critical medical appointments and students to miss school, and is keeping some disabled residents from reaching specialty-care facilities.

As Mr. Trump<U+2019>s chances of winning the presidential election appeared to be waning Monday, the companies he has singled out for criticism were recovering from their cameo appearances in his campaign. Stocks rallied Monday after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said there was nothing to see in Hillary Clinton <U+2019>s emails, and continued to climb Tuesday. Leading the way were several of the companies Mr. Trump trashed during the campaign. The Republican presidential candidate told his Twitter followers to boycott Macy<U+2019>s Inc. after it stopped selling his menswear line. Macy<U+2019>s shares rose 2.8% over Monday and Tuesday, ahead of the Dow Jones Industrial Average<U+2019>s 2.5% rise. He tweeted that Amazon.com Inc. was avoiding taxes and accused its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, of using the Washington Post, which Mr. Bezos owns, as a <U+201C>tool for political power<U+201D> against him . Amazon rose 4.3% over the two days. Mr. Trump tore into Ford Motor Co. for its plan to move small-car production to Mexico and criticized Walt Disney Co. for replacing information-technology workers at its Florida theme park with foreign labor. Both stocks<U+2019> gains were just ahead of the market<U+2019>s rise on Monday. Ford was among auto makers whose stocks fell Tuesday on worries about sales, while Disney<U+2019>s shares were roughly flat ahead of its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report Thursday. The moves were different than the typical ups and downs of stocks expected to benefit from a victory by either candidate. Mr. Trump changed that game by specifically singling out several companies for criticism. Most recently, Mr. Trump said he would block AT&T Inc. <U+2019>s proposed deal for Time Warner Inc. and even threatened to try to break up Comcast Corp. <U+2019>s 2011 acquisition of NBCUniversal. Time Warner shares, which have remained well below the deal offer, rose 1.7% over Monday and Tuesday. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s lowest blow may have come in a tweet last year to T-Mobile US Inc.: <U+201C>I think the service is terrible!<U+201D> The wireless carrier<U+2019>s shares rose 2.3% in the past two days. Stocks that were expected to benefit from a Trump presidency didn<U+2019>t fare as well on Monday. The shares of for-profit college DeVry Education Group Inc. declined 1%, although they rebounded 3.1% Tuesday. Write to Miriam Gottfried at Miriam.Gottfried@wsj.com",

Mr. Mnuchin<U+2019>s comments are consistent with those made by Mr. Trump and other advisers. But they are significant since he himself has said little on publicly about policy matters, and his Wednesday remarks offer a fresh window into his thinking and priorities. Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive, discussed the Volcker rule provision in the law<U+2014>named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker<U+2014>which is aimed at trying to stop banks from betting with deposit-insured funds. Goldman and other Wall Street firms have complained that the rule is too opaque and complex. <U+201C>The number one problem with the Volcker rule is it<U+2019>s way too complicated and people don<U+2019>t know how to interpret it,<U+201D> Mr. Mnuchin said. <U+201C>So we<U+2019>re going to look at what do with it, as we are with all of Dodd-Frank.<U+201D> In the interview, Mr. Mnuchin alluded to his crisis-era foray into the banking industry, when he was part of a group that bought the failed IndyMac Bank from the government. He became chairman of the renamed OneWest Bank in Los Angeles, which eventually was sold to CIT Group Inc. He currently sits on CIT<U+2019>s board. <U+201C>We<U+2019>ve been in the business of regional banking and we understand what it is to make loans,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>That<U+2019>s the engine of growth to small- and medium-size businesses.<U+201D> Regional banks in particular have been lobbying for relief from Dodd-Frank.

        "original_post": "Asian share markets were broadly higher Friday, with Japan<U+2019>s Nikkei hitting a 10-month high as the yen weakened. The Nikkei Stock Average, at one point up as much as 0.8%, finished with a 0.3% gain as profit-taking set in. That brought its November gain to 5.5%, best of Asia<U+2019>s benchmarks. Australia<U+2019>s S&P\/ASX 200 closed up 0.4% and Singapore<U+2019>s Straits Times Index added 0.8% while the Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.6%. The dollar rose further against the yen, though the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday subdued volume. Expectations of higher inflation in the U.S. under a Donald Trump administration are driving the currency<U+2019>s broad strength, said Seiichi Tanaka, head of foreign-exchange spot trading at Mizuho Bank. A weaker yen makes Japanese exports more competitive and increases the value of overseas profits when they are repatriated. Among exporters, Mitsubishi Motors gained 6%, Nissan 3.4% and Honda Motor 2%. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index added 0.6%. <U+201C>We see some interest coming in from the mainland China helping Hong Kong hold up compared to Asian markets,<U+201D> said Caroline Yu Maurer, head of Greater China equities at BNP Paribas Investment Partners . China Life Insurance gained 4.2% and Ping An Insurance 2.1%. A falling yuan has mainland investors hedging their investments in Hong Kong, whose currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar. They are also anticipating the opening of the trading link between the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock exchanges, which will likely boost volumes and valuations, Ms. Maurer said. Strength in global commodity prices is helping drive share gains in Australia. On Thursday, copper hit a 17-month high as bullish manufacturing expectations outweighed the impact of a multiyear high for the U.S. dollar. Miners BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto rose 2.3% and 2.4%, respectively. <U+201C>There is strong momentum in copper, coal and other commodities,<U+201D> said Castor Pang, head of research at Core Pacific-Yamaichi International, adding that the price surge is driven by speculation. <U+201C>It seems that investors believe there may be very strong demand from the U.S.<U+201D> Expectations of a deal to cut global oil output at next week<U+2019>s meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries<U+2014>Iraq has indicated its willingness to freeze production<U+2014>continued to help energy shares. Woodside Petroleum and Santos in Australia added 1.1% and 0.2%, respectively. In Japan, Inpex Corp. rose 0.5%. Nevertheless, Brent, the international crude-oil benchmark, was down 1% in Asian trade at $48.50 per barrel. In the fixed-income market, Asian-Pacific government bond yields rose further as capital outflows from emerging markets continued. The yield on Indonesia<U+2019>s 10-year debt rose to 8.262% from 8.160% Thursday, and on South Korea<U+2019>s to 2.185% from 2.179%, according to Thomson Reuters.

Predicting that growth stocks such as Walt Disney Co. will thrive in the early days of a new administration bucks historical evidence, though. U.S. stocks typically do worst during the first year of a presidential cycle. Since 1833, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has averaged a 2.5% gain in the first postelection year, with more down years than up, according to the book <U+201D>Stock Trader<U+2019>s Almanac.<U+201D> If one must be in the market, then defensive yield payers offer some income and protection. But past isn<U+2019>t prologue. Much of stocks<U+2019> slow start is due to new presidents typically overpromising the implementation of new policies and reforms on the campaign trail and underdelivering once on the job.<U+00A0>Mr. Trump has advocated for less regulation , lower taxes and more fiscal spending. If implemented, those policies should help juice an economy currently stuck in its slowest recovery of the postwar era. With Trump advisers set on making a splash and Republicans retaining majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives, he might avoid the gridlock that has crippled predecessors. Any successful implementation of these measures could boost growth, which in turn should benefit cyclical stocks. What could go wrong? Plenty, including how far along we are in this bull market and economic expansion. Equity valuations are elevated and earnings are only now showing a glimmer of growth following four consecutive quarters of contraction . Mr. Trump has even warned that equity prices are in a bubble and said in August that he <U+201C>got out<U+201D> of the stock market. But he probably would like nothing more than a vote of confidence from financial markets after getting one from the electorate. A nearly 1,000-point rebound in Dow Jones Industrial Average futures<U+00A0>in 12 hours<U+00A0>Wednesday<U+00A0>certainly is a good start. The bond market sent an even more convincing signal: The benchmark Treasury note yield surged above 2% and reached its highest level since January . That might anticipate stimulus and perhaps even a whiff of inflation<U+2014>which would benefit growth stocks. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s script for the American economy is still under wraps, but in two short months it will be <U+201C>lights, camera, action.<U+201D>",

        "original_post": "WASHINGTON<U+2014>Federal Reserve governor Daniel Tarullo on Tuesday<U+00A0>said the central bank should still proceed cautiously as it decides whether to lift interest rates despite stronger recent data. The Fed<U+2019>s regulatory point man said that while data over the last several months has shown actual inflation rising , moderately higher wage growth, and slightly higher labor-force participation than had been expected, the central bank should continue to proceed slowly in lifting rates . The Fed is scheduled to hold its next meeting of the policy setting Federal Open Market Committee on<U+00A0>Dec. 13-14. <U+201C>The discussion of when is the appropriate moment for raising rates in order to prevent the economy from overheating too much -- is now from my point of view -- more on the table than it may have been before,<U+201D> Mr. Tarullo said at The Wall Street Journal<U+2019>s CEO Council . Grounds for caution, he said, include the continued slack in the labor market and the concern that the central bank has <U+201C>fewer tools<U+201D> to respond to a recession. <U+201C>There are reasons to be cautious in moving forward,<U+201D> said Mr. Tarullo. <U+201C>We obviously don<U+2019>t want to be pushing on the brakes harder than we need to in order to continue the trend of moderate growth.<U+201D> Separately, Mr. Tarullo said<U+00A0>ongoing discussions by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to finalize a capital framework by the end of the year will have a <U+201C>negligible<U+201D> effect on the largest, most-complex U.S. banks. He said revisions to the capital rules now being negotiated won<U+2019>t be <U+201C>particularly significant<U+201D> for U.S. banks. Still, he stressed the necessity for establishing minimum capital levels for global banks that aren't based on internal models to ensure stability. Looking ahead to the post-election landscape, Mr. Tarullo declined to speculate on the outcome of pledges President-elect Donald Trump made on the campaign trail to dismantle the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-regulatory law. <U+201C>If changes are made, we will implement faithfully to the changes that Congress makes,<U+201D> said Mr. Tarullo. Mr. Tarullo said any changes made by Congress should be data-driven. He said the Fed has applied similar thinking in making changes to its annual stress test exercise. Mr. Tarullo suggested he<U+2019>s not planning to leave the Fed following the election of Mr. Trump, saying he<U+2019>s engaged and enjoying his job. His term expires<U+00A0>in 2022.

        "original_post": "FRANKFURT<U+2014>Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said<U+00A0>on Friday he is leaning toward supporting a rate increase at the U.S. Federal Reserve<U+2019>s December policy meeting. <U+201C>Markets are currently [pricing in a] high probability of a December move, I<U+2019>m leaning toward supporting that,<U+201D> Mr. Bullard said at a banking conference here. <U+201C>The question now is about 2017.<U+201D> Investors expect the Fed to increase interest rates next month for the first time in a year. They have begun pricing in a faster pace of rate increases since President-Elect Donald Trump pledged during campaigning for the Nov. 8 election to boost spending on infrastructure and cut taxes, which could stimulate the economy. Mr. Bullard stressed that a 25-basis point rate increase, which financial markets expect policy makers to deliver, effectively amounts to no change from the central bank. <U+201C>It is better to see the Fed as approximately on hold, with just very small moves upward,<U+201D> he told reporters. <U+201C>One change a year, with the [Fed<U+2019>s] balance sheet still big, is really not much of a change in U.S. monetary policy,<U+201D> he said. Asked about the impact of the U.S. elections , Mr. Bullard said the new Republican-controlled administration would likely adopt tax and fiscal measures that could spur the U.S. economy by 2018 or 2019. The rise in government bond yields and inflation expectations since Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory is a <U+201C>positive sign,<U+201D> he said, pushing government bond yields to about the level they were when the Fed hiked rates a year ago. <U+201C>So far so good, if we<U+2019>ve raised inflation expectations back to more natural levels,<U+201D> he said. The Fed is likely to prove resistant to any political changes instituted by the new administration, he added, highlighting the central bank<U+2019>s large staff and institutional memory. Foreign investors have been given plenty of time to prepare for higher U.S. interest rates, Mr. Bullard added. Still, the Fed official said U.S. policy rates probably wouldn<U+2019>t need to rise a large amount given slow economic growth and sluggish productivity gains. <U+201C>We<U+2019>ve been saying the policy rate probably doesn<U+2019>t need to change too much<U+201D> to suit the current economic environment, he said. He added that he doesn<U+2019>t see a bubble in the U.S. economy of the same magnitude as those of the late 1990s and mid 2000s.

The RNC made a legal filing in federal court in New Jersey, where it is subject to a three-decade-old legal settlement restricting such activities.

Citing persistent terrors threats and Spring elections scheduled that will come with many political rallies that could be targets for attacks, Mr. Hollande said his government will ask parliament to extend the year-old state of emergency. <U+201C>I want to extend the state of emergency until the presidential election,<U+201D> he said, during an interview with TV station France24. The first round of the French presidential election is scheduled for April 23, with the runoff round is set for May 4. The state of emergency was introduced in November 2015, after a series of terror attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. The measure gives authorities far-reaching powers, including banning people from leaving their homes and conducting searches without a court order. The French authorities have extended the state of emergency several times since its implementation, as the country has been hit by other terror attacks, while police foiled many others. Still, the most recent debate in parliament was acrimonious, as many opposition legislators criticized how Mr. Hollande<U+2019>s socialist administration handled the situation. During the same interview, Mr. Hollande unveiled details of his conversation with U.S. president elect Donald Trump this past weekend. <U+201C>From the conversation I had, I understood (Mr. Trump) is in a phase of calming-down and collaboration with his partners,<U+201D> Mr. Hollande said, adding he expects the president elect to make clear his position on a series of issues, such as climate agreements, Iran, Syria and Ukraine.

        "original_post": "Schlumberger Ltd. , the world<U+2019>s largest oil driller by market value, said Sunday it had signed a preliminary deal to study an Iranian oil field, as Donald Trump<U+2019>s presidential victory has yet to deter U.S.-connected companies from dealing with Tehran. The contract is one of the most prominent signed since the Nov. 8 election. Mr. Trump has vowed to undo a nuclear pact with Tehran signed last year by global powers. The pledge has led many international companies to freeze their plans to enter the Islamic Republic despite the country<U+2019>s huge potential as an energy and consumer market. But a spokesman for Schlumberger, one of the world<U+2019>s largest oil-services companies, told The Wall Street Journal it has signed a memorandum of understanding with the state-run National Iranian Oil Company <U+201C>for the non-disclosure of data required for a technical evaluation of a field development prospect.<U+201D> Though it is incorporated in Cura<U+00E7>ao in the Dutch Antilles, Schlumberger has one of its headquarters in Houston, while some of its shares trade in New York. If completed, the deal would be the first in Iran for Schlumberger since European sanctions for the company to leave the country in 2010. Schlumberger said the deal does not involve the execution of oilfield services operations and it intends to comply with the laws and regulations of the countries where it operates. Though most international sanctions on Iran<U+2019>s energy industry were lifted in January, Washington has maintained a ban on U.S. companies and citizens from investing in that country<U+2019>s oil fields. European oil giants have stepped into the breach, culminating with an agreement by France<U+2019>s Total SA to join a $4.8 billion investment in an Iranian gas field hours before Mr. Trump was elected. Despite uncertainty over what the president-elect will do over the Iran nuclear deal, Schlumberger is not the only one to pursue Iranian opportunities. Immediately after Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election, Norway<U+2019>s DNO signed up to study a key Iranian oil field near the Iraqi border . European aircraft maker Airbus Group SE recently received U.S. government backing for the export of more than 100 jetliners to Iran, despite a move by U.S. lawmakers to curb such transactions.

        "original_post": "WASHINGTON<U+2014>The U.S. publicly detailed its intent to attack the two biggest cities that Islamic State controls to show the extremist group and its sympathizers that a self-declared caliphate will be stamped out, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said. Mr. Carter<U+2019>s comments come a day after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump criticized the Pentagon for announcing its assault on Mosul, the capital of Islamic State<U+2019>s self-declared caliphate in Iraq, months before the campaign to retake the city began. The Pentagon has also announced the commencement of a campaign by U.S.-backed forces to retake the Syrian city of Raqqa from Islamic State. Mr. Trump maintains that the U.S. should keep its plans secret to use the element of surprise against the extremists. Mr. Carter, answering questions at an event in Washington organized by The Atlantic magazine, countered the president-elect<U+2019>s view. <U+201C>There are secret tactics involved, but the fact that we<U+2019>re going to Mosul and Raqqa is clear because they<U+2019>re the two biggest cities,<U+201D> Mr. Carter said. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s actually important that the enemy know and that (Islamic State) everywhere else know that we intend (to) and will destroy them.<U+201D> Mr. Carter said it was important to destroy Islamic State in Iraq and Syria to debase the <U+201C>inspiration factor<U+201D> for supporters and undercut the idea of a caliphate, <U+201C>so that people know that this is not a happening thing, this is something that is going to be stamped out.<U+201D> Mr. Trump declined to detail his plan to destroy Islamic State in his interview with <U+201C>60 Minutes<U+201D> that aired Sunday night. <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t want to tell anybody anything,<U+201D> he said. Mr. Carter, who became President Barack Obama <U+2019>s secretary of Defense in early 2015, said Mr. Trump<U+2019>s transition team had yet to arrive at the Pentagon but likely would come this week. He said his staff stood ready to welcome them and help the team get started. The outgoing Defense secretary also urged the U.S.<U+2019>s North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies to engage with the incoming Trump administration, even though the president-elect questioned the North Atlantic Treaty Organization<U+2019>s value on the campaign trail. <U+201C>Engage with the new administration, work with them, stay committed to the values and the principles that we have stood for,<U+201D> Mr. Carter said to the U.S.<U+2019>s NATO allies. <U+201C>Remember that we have a lot of people who are trying to attack all of us collectively, and we<U+2019>re much better at protecting ourselves if we can find a way to work together.<U+201D> At a news conference Monday, Mr. Obama said that during his meeting with Mr. Trump last week, the incoming U.S. leader voiced support for key American alliances, including NATO.

        "original_post": "Asian markets were broadly higher Thursday after an overnight gain in oil prices, and a perceived victory by Hillary Clinton in the third and final U.S. presidential debate . Hong Kong<U+2019>s Hang Seng Index closed up 0.3% and Australia<U+2019>s S&P\/ASX 200 added 0.1%. <U+201C>Asia markets are quietly positive <U+2026> the strong oil price is supporting the energy sector,<U+201D> said Margaret Yang, market analyst at CMC Markets. Brent, the global benchmark, fell 0.9% in Asia trade to $52.22 on profit-taking, after rising 1.9% overnight. Japan<U+2019>s Nikkei closed at its highest level in six months, driven higher by a weaker yen and a view that Democratic nominee Clinton prevailed in her debate with Republican rival Donald Trump, which played out Thursday morning Tokyo time. The Nikkei ended up 1.4% at 17235.50, its highest level since April 27. The yen was down 0.2%, according to Thomson Reuters. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s policies are widely seen as unfriendly to Asian economies and markets. Oil stocks were among the biggest gainers in the region. In Hong Kong, Chinese offshore oil producer Cnooc gained 2.1% and PetroChina added 3%. Taiwan<U+2019>s Taiex rose 0.4%, led by energy and petrochemical stocks. Formosa Petrochemical and Formosa Plastics climbed 1.9% and 3.4%, respectively. In Australia, Woodside Petroleum was up about 0.9% and BHP Billiton was up 1.7%. Despite the strength in energy stocks, shares in Australia were capped after data on Thursday showed a surprise drop in the number of people employed. The number of Australians employed fell for the second consecutive month in September, registering a decline of 9,800, compared with an expected 15,000 rise. This followed a revised fall in employment of 8,600 in August, which was originally reported as a 3,900 decline. <U+201C>The Australian jobs number was a shock this morning,<U+201D> said Christoffer Moltke-Leth, director of global sales trading at Saxo Capital Markets in Singapore. In China, the Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.01%, following recent gains built on strong economic data from China this week. Later in the global day, investors will be looking to the ECB meeting for trading cues. The central bank is widely expected to leave its policies unchanged, confirming it will continue to buy <U+20AC>80 billion ($88 billion) a month of mainly government bonds until at least March. The market will be looking for signals about what will happen after that point. <U+201C>We<U+2026>think there will be a dovish tone from the ECB,<U+201D> said Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale . The euro fell to a multiweek low against the dollar ahead of the ECB meeting. The euro is at risk of weakening past its post-Brexit level of 1.0912 to the dollar if ECB chief Mario Draghi hints at extra easing, said Takuya Kawabata, analyst at Gaitame.Com Research Institute. <U+2014>John Wu, Hiroyuki Kachi, Kosaku Narioka, James Glynn, Ese Erheriene and Kenan Machado contributed to this article.

        "original_post": "The vice-presidential debate between Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine and Republican Gov. Mike Pence brought in 37 million viewers, according to Nielsen, making it the least-watched vice-presidential debate since 29 million viewers watched Dick Cheney face off against Joe Lieberman in 2000. NBC led the broadcasters with about 7 million viewers on Tuesday night, compared with about 6.5 million tuning in on CBS , 6.15 million on ABC and 2.2 million on Fox. Among cable networks, Fox News won with about 6.1 million viewers, while CNN drew in 4.2 million and MSNBC generated 3.1 million viewers. While the numbers were down from other vice-presidential debates in recent history, this election cycle has been a boon for TV networks<U+2019> ratings overall. After a closely watched primary season and highly rated conventions, the first of three duels between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump broke the presidential debate viewership record when 84 million people tuned in last week . The vice-presidential contest was thought to be less of a marquee political matchup. It was certainly less anticipated than the debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin in 2008, which brought in 69.9 million people, making it the most viewed of any vice-presidential debate in history. Mr. Biden<U+2019>s bout with Paul Ryan in 2012 drew 51.4 million viewers. The Kaine-Pence showdown ranks as the eighth most-watched VP debate on record. The No. 7 debate was the 1976 matchup between Walter Mondale and Bob Dole, which drew 43.2 million viewers, according to Nielsen data. Messrs. Kaine and Pence sparred in a combative debate covering topics ranging from Mr. Trump<U+2019>s tax returns to Russia to immigration, as moderator Elaine Quijano of CBS News struggled at times to keep the pair from interrupting each other. Both candidates sought to defend their running mates, and afterward both campaigns attempted to claim victory. Like the first presidential debate, viewers had plenty of options for how to watch the 90-minute, commercial-free event. Many broadcast and cable TV networks aired the debate. Viewers also could watch live streams on platforms like Facebook , Twitter and YouTube, though that viewership is not counted by traditional Nielsen ratings. Vice-presidential debates rarely sway voters, but they still are huge live viewing events at a time when TV viewership has been challenged by streaming services and video-on-demand platforms. Networks are typically able to sell lucrative advertisement slots during pre- and post-debate coverage. Write to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "The surprise election of Donald Trump has been a boon for Wall Street<U+2019>s trading desks. Tom Montag, who runs Bank of America Corp. <U+2019>s global banking and markets units, said Tuesday that the bank had clocked its biggest day ever by volume on both the New York Stock Exchange and Japan<U+2019>s Nikkei on Wed., Nov. 9, the day after Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election . That should help propel the bank<U+2019>s fourth-quarter trading results, which Mr. Montag said he expects to exceed last year<U+2019>s fourth quarter by double digits. Still, he also noted that trading so far in the fourth quarter was <U+201C>not as robust<U+201D> as the third quarter, when banks benefited from investors<U+2019> uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates and the lingering effects of the U.K.<U+2019> s Brexit vote in late June. Bank stocks have rallied since Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election on twin assumptions: that the new president will fuel economic growth with infrastructure spending , and cut down on regulation . Mr. Montag, who is also the bank<U+2019>s chief operating officer and the No. 2 official behind CEO Brian Moynihan, said Bank of America was in a good position to take advantage of growth if it happens. Shares of Bank of America on Monday closed up more than 5% to $20.08<U+2014>their highest close since Nov. 2008. Tuesday morning they gave up some of those gains. Mr. Montag said that over all, new post-financial-crisis regulations had improved the safety of U.S. banks and given people comfort in the industry<U+2019>s safety. But Mr. Montag also said it was <U+201C>probably healthy<U+201D> to <U+201C>take a breath<U+201D> and look at whether new regulations made sense or could be improved or made more efficient. <U+201C>Now that we have the regulation are there ways to make it better and more efficient and still get the same amount of benefit out of it?<U+201D> Mr. Montag said. He called <U+201C>pretty interesting<U+201D> Rep. Jeb Hensarling<U+2019>s Financial Choice Act . This is legislation the Texas Republican, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, has proposed in what is essentially a replacement for the Dodd-Frank Act. Mr. Montag said that <U+201C>virtually all<U+201D> of tech spending in his units, banking and markets, is devoted to regulatory compliance, and he indicated that the election was making banks think twice about how to allot that money. As an example, he referred to the Volcker rule , which bars banks from taking proprietary bets but which Mr. Hensarling has opposed. Mr. Montag said it would be frustrating <U+201C>if you spend another $30 million to be up to speed on Volcker but there<U+2019>s a chance they change something in Volcker.<U+201D> Write to Christina Rexrode at christina.rexrode@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "Even the Senate can<U+2019>t keep the two Time Warner companies straight. Despite striking an $85.4 billion deal with AT&T Inc. over the weekend, Jeff Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner Inc., unceremoniously was left out of a release from the Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee, which said the CEOs of both companies would testify at a hearing on the accord. The reason? The four top Republicans and Democrats leading the Senate Judiciary Committee and its antitrust subcommittee accidentally named Time Warner Cable<U+2019>s former CEO Rob Marcus instead. Time Warner Inc. owns HBO, CNN and Warner Bros. Time Warner Cable, the cable and internet provider that recently sold itself to Charter Communications Inc. <U+201C>Both Randall Stephenson, the CEO of AT&T, and Robert Marcus, the CEO of Time Warner, will testify,<U+201D> the release said. The hearing announcement was sent by Sens. Chuck Grassley, Patrick Leahy, Mike Lee and Amy Klobuchar. Shortly after, the Committee sent a corrected news release naming Mr. Bewkes instead of Mr. Marcus. A representative for the Committee said the correct executive was invited to the hearing. It<U+2019>s far from the first time someone has confused the two companies. It<U+2019>s been a bit of a headache for AT&T and Time Warner during the last several dizzying days since they announced their megamerger. Not only have they been clobbered by opposition from politicians including Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, many consumers have tweeted and emailed reporters at The Wall Street Journal confusing the two companies. It doesn<U+2019>t help that Time Warner Cable had a long history as one of the most-hated companies in the U.S. known for its poor customer service. Senior executives at Time Warner were chuckling on Thursday as they read the antitrust committee release. For days, they have suspected that at least part of the backlash stemmed from politicians confusing Time Warner with Time Warner Cable. Earlier this week, AT&T tried to clear up the issue in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. <U+201C>Time Warner Inc. should not be confused with Time Warner Cable, which is a distinct, independent company owned by Charter Communications,<U+201D> the filing explained. <U+201C>In 2008, Time Warner and Time Warner Cable announced a complete legal and structural separation of the companies. That separation was completed in 2009, and the companies have been completely separate and independent entities ever since.<U+201D> Clearly, the lawmakers haven<U+2019>t kept up-to-date with their SEC filings. The Journal earlier this year wrote about how Mr. Bewkes would like to be thought of as the <U+201C>Game of Thrones<U+201D> guy. But to many, he is, unfortunately, the Cable Guy. Mr. Marcus left Time Warner Cable after the Charter deal closed. In an email to this reporter, Mr. Marcus said he <U+201C>didn<U+2019>t know I was invited to D.C. until I read your post.<U+201D> The hearing is slated for Dec. 7 at 10 a.m. in the Judiciary Committee hearing room. The Senate better get Mr. Bewkes his invite. <U+2014>Thomas Gryta contributed to this article. Write to Shalini Ramachandran at shalini.ramachandran@wsj.com",

He pointed to comments in Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory speech , indicating that the president-elect would deal fairly with other nations and seek common ground. <U+201C>Let<U+2019>s take the newly elected president at his word,<U+201D> Mr. Weidmann said. But the Bundesbank president warned that the U.S. election result, together with Britain<U+2019>s vote to leave the European Union , raised questions over how far protectionism will determine the future political agenda. <U+201C>A significant part of our prosperity is based on open markets and functioning institutions,<U+201D> Mr. Weidmann said. ECB policy makers are currently preparing for a key meeting on<U+00A0>Dec. 8, when they are expected to decide on the future of their <U+20AC>80 billion a month bond-purchase program, which is due to end in March. Some analysts say Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory makes it more likely that the ECB will extend or boost its bond purchase program. Mr. Weidmann<U+2014>long a critic of the ECB<U+2019>s bond purchases<U+2014>stressed that the central bank<U+2019>s easy-money policies shouldn<U+2019>t be kept in place for too long. He said their effectiveness faded over time even as their adverse side effects mounted, including declining profit for the region<U+2019>s banks. <U+201C>The therapy of an ultraloose monetary policy shouldn<U+2019>t be continued for longer than needed,<U+201D> he said. Speaking in Tallinn earlier on Thursday, Ardo Hansson, who sits on the ECB<U+2019>s governing council as head of Estonia<U+2019>s central bank,<U+00A0>didn<U+2019>t rule out that the U.S. election result could impact the ECB<U+2019>s policy deliberations in December. <U+201C>We need a little bit more time<U+201D> to assess the impact, Mr.<U+00A0>Hansson<U+00A0>said. <U+201C>We still have several weeks until December.<U+00A0>By that time we<U+2019>ll have a much clearer idea.<U+201D> The ECB is also expected to change the design of its bond-purchase program at its next policy meeting to ensure it doesn<U+2019>t run out of bonds to buy. Under its current rules, the ECB buys mainly government bonds in proportion to the size of each eurozone economy. It can<U+2019>t buy more than 33% of most bond issues, or bonds yielding less than minus 0.4%. That excludes a large share of German government bonds. Mr. Weidmann cautioned against violating the program<U+2019>s <U+201C>red lines.<U+201D> <U+201C>It is decisive that the current government-bond purchase program doesn<U+2019>t envisage loss-sharing or introduce shared liability for government debt through the back door,<U+201D> he said.

But the media needs to stop accepting this as the new normal for receiving and then reporting on <U+201C>information.<U+201D> It<U+2019>s very one-sided. You can<U+2019>t ask face-to-face questions of a tweet (Mr. Trump<U+2019>s plan all along, I<U+2019>m sure). Journalists and the media just ponder and postulate and chase their tails and regurgitate what Mr. Trump wants us all to hear and accept. This is not journalism. The media need to start demanding access to this guy on a regular basis. MELANIE CURRY Portland, Ore. To the Editor: You note that Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for President-elect Donald Trump, declined to say for now whether Mr. Trump would move his Twitter musings to the White House<U+2019>s official Twitter account from his own account. Does this pose a risk of hacking or a security breach <U+2014> similar to what Mr. Trump criticized Hillary Clinton for, using her own server for emails? His tweets could at some point be construed to contain or allude to classified information. Might using his own account allow a way around White House security to hack into classified correspondence? Is this something that is being addressed? ALISON B. REA New York To the Editor: I have been following Donald Trump for about a year now on Twitter. He and I agree on pretty much nothing, but I have gotten great insight into the man by reading his blunt tweets. They serve as vivid quick looks into how Mr. Trump perceives the world. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s use of Twitter after the inauguration will provide me with a direct communication link to the president. I can read and interpret his messages directly, without third-party spin. I can reply-tweet instantly to share my thoughts, which I think is insanely democratic. There is a huge upside to Mr. Trump<U+2019>s tweets. PIETRO ALLAR Forest Hills, Queens To the Editor: Every time I check the top stories in The Times, it<U+2019>s all about Donald Trump. I am suffering from Trump exhaustion.

If Mr. Trump truly loved this country and respected its institutions, he would cease promoting this virulent lie, for the sake of domestic tranquillity. That he refuses to do so proves that he will stop at nothing to reach his goal, regardless of the harm that may ensue. It was my hope that he would lose this election and fade into the twilight.

        "original_post": "Someone threw a postelection party and forgot to invite Wal-Mart Stores Inc. As the major stock indexes rallied sharply after Donald Trump<U+2019>s surprise victory, retail and supermarket stocks were among the biggest winners. Whole Foods Inc., Supervalu Inc. and Kroger Co. all jumped. Macy<U+2019>s Inc. and Kohl<U+2019>s Corp. notched double-digit percentage gains. Target Corp. on Wednesday<U+00A0>had its biggest one-day increase in two years after boosting its holiday outlook. Wal-Mart has been conspicuously absent. The world<U+2019>s largest retailer has underperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the election. And while an upbeat earnings report<U+00A0>Thursday could help close the gap, any further upside seems limited. Analysts polled by FactSet forecast estimate third-quarter earnings of 96 cents a share, down from $1.03 a year earlier. Revenue for the period is expected to log an uptick of just 1% to $118.6 billion. Mr. Trump has advocated for lower taxes , less regulation and more fiscal spending, which in theory should juice the economy and has helped stoke the broad market rally.<U+00A0>But Wal-Mart is known for beating the market during tough times.<U+00A0>It was one of the few blue chips that rose in 2008 thanks to its defensive characteristics. Today, American consumers are loosening their purse strings. U.S. retail sales have had their best two-month performance in at least two years, according to government data released this week. Furthermore, potential friction with Mexico and a tumble in that country<U+2019>s currency may hurt. Wal-Mart has 2,373 stores in Mexico, roughly 20% of its locations. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart<U+2019>s bottom line has been pressured by heavy spending on higher wages, store improvements and building out its e-commerce operations. It acquired Jet.com earlier this year for $3.3 billion, the largest purchase ever of an e-commerce startup. And in October, Wal-Mart offered a muted earnings outlook for its next fiscal year, saying it expects earnings to be flat from the prior year. It expects to slow new store openings as it focuses more on digital. Even after missing out on the postelection rally, Wal-Mart shares are still up about 17% for the year, more than double the Dow and S&P 500. Fetching 16 times projected earnings, the stock isn<U+2019>t much of a bargain. Whether other retailers have much to celebrate is an open question, it isn<U+2019>t Wal-Mart<U+2019>s type of crowd anyway.",

        "original_post": "Markets got the political call wrong again. But they have also proved they can be blisteringly fast in adjusting. Nowhere in the financial-market reaction to Donald Trump <U+2019>s unanticipated victory in the U.S. presidential election is that clearer than in the U.S. yield curve. The initial reaction, as after June<U+2019>s Brexit vote, was to flee risk and seek safety. In Asian trading, the 10-year Treasury yield fell as low as 1.72%, as stocks fell sharply and gold rallied, a typical response to a shock. The Mexican peso, the poster boy for the risk of a win by Mr. Trump, fell more than 10% against the dollar before rebounding a little. The two-day pre-election rally driven by expectations of a Hillary Clinton victory, meaning a preservation of the status quo, quickly reversed. But less than 12 hours later, 10-year Treasury yields were up at 1.97%; 30-year yields were up even more sharply at 2.77%. The yield curve, far from flattening as might be expected after a political shock, steepened sharply. Two-year yields were slightly lower. The steeper yield curve suggests concerns about the fiscal and inflationary consequences of Mr. Trump<U+2019>s potential policy decisions, including higher deficits and changes at the Federal Reserve. Government bond issuance could rise sharply. Higher yields were always a likely outcome <U+2014>but the speed with which they have arrived is remarkable. In reality, while one form of uncertainty has been resolved by the election, another form of uncertainty has risen that is more difficult for investors to evaluate. Mr. Trump<U+2019>s victory brings many more questions about what his actual policies will be. Foreign, trade and fiscal policy will be in particular focus. Those policies and the policies of all governments have grown more important this year as politics has gained primacy over monetary policy. The shift breaks up a long-running dance between the markets and central banks, something that investors had grown accustomed to. The move in yields will have consequences elsewhere. Short-duration assets such as high-yield corporate bonds should be insulated, but sentiment about emerging markets could suffer, particularly for countries that rely on continued inflows of foreign capital. And the shift also plays into a theme that has already pushed yields sharply higher from their post-Brexit lows: that of reflation. Bonds in the U.S. aren<U+2019>t as expensive as elsewhere<U+2014>eurozone markets are still awash with negative-yielding government debt<U+2014>but the dynamics are clearly shifting. Monetary policy is no longer the only game in town. Markets will have to get used to paying much more attention to the politics. Write to Richard Barley at richard.barley@wsj.com",

        "original_post": "JANESVILLE, Wis.<U+2014>House Speaker Paul Ryan on Wednesday struck a positive tone toward President-elect Donald Trump, saying a united Republican Party will stand together after Mr. Trump<U+2019>s stunning election victory, work to repeal the 2010 health-care law and enact other priorities on the GOP agenda. <U+201C>This is the most incredible political feat I<U+2019>ve seen in my lifetime,<U+201D> Mr. Ryan said at a news conference in his hometown here, where as expected he won his own re-election bid. <U+201C>Donald Trump heard a voice out in this country that no one else heard<U+2026>he connected in ways with people that no one else did.<U+201D> Mr. Ryan, who said he had spoken with Mr. Trump last night and again this morning to congratulate him, said he believed the Republican Party<U+2019>s wins in the Senate and House, which enable them to maintain control of both chambers next year, will allow the president-elect to lead a <U+201C>unified<U+201D> government and break through Washington gridlock. Among the tasks for the Republican Congress, Mr. Ryan said, will be to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act passed by President Barack Obama, a law he described as <U+201C>collapsing under its own weight.<U+201D> <U+201C>Now we have President Trump coming who is asking us to do this,<U+201D> he said, referring to the health-care law. He didn<U+2019>t elaborate on what will happen to those who are covered by the law currently and whether they will lose their health insurance. The House speaker and Mr. Trump have had a testy relationship, with Mr. Ryan offering only tepid support for the Republican nominee during the election campaign. Often during the campaign Mr. Ryan didn<U+2019>t mention Mr. Trump by name, and Mr. Trump, for his part, has labeled the speaker an ineffective and weak leader, blaming him for splintering the party. On Wednesday, Mr. Ryan said that his party<U+2019>s gains this election were on the <U+201C>coattails<U+201D> of Mr. Trump, adding that their relationship <U+201C>is fine.<U+201D> He also reaffirmed that he would run again as House speaker. Republicans maintained control of the House in Tuesday<U+2019>s elections, though they lost a handful of seats that makes their margin of control narrower and could make Mr. Ryan<U+2019>s job more difficult. <U+201C>We are going to hit the ground running,<U+201D> he added, pledging to heal the campaign<U+2019>s divisions. <U+201C>There is relief coming, this is good for our country.<U+201D> He didn<U+2019>t comment on whether Congress would support Mr. Trump<U+2019>s election promise to build a wall along the border of Mexico, or whether he<U+2019>d back funding for it. <U+2014>Kristina Peterson contributed to this article.
