This is consistent with the text that mentions lenticular clouds over Mount Fuji in Japan. Lenticular clouds are indeed a natural phenomenon that can occur under certain atmospheric conditions, and Mount Fuji is a location where such clouds have been observed and photographed. Therefore, there is no apparent inconsistency between the text and the image that would suggest misinformation.", "external knowledge": "Lenticular clouds are a type of cloud formation that can appear as lens-shaped clouds. They are typically formed when moist air flows over a mountain or mountain range, creating a series of standing waves. If the temperature at the crest of the wave drops to the dew point, moisture in the air may condense to form lenticular clouds. Mount Fuji, being a prominent mountain, is known for such cloud formations, which are often photographed and shared on social media and other platforms."}, "You are given a piece of **Input Text** and an image.
