        "explain": "Based on the new references provided, the original claim of \"at least 18 deaths\" in the Paris incident appears to be inconsistent with the external knowledge and facts presented. The external resources indicate that there was indeed an attack in Paris near the Eiffel Tower, but the number of fatalities reported is one, not 18. Multiple sources, including The Guardian, BBC, and CNN, confirm that one person was killed and two others were injured in the attack. This discrepancy between the original claim and the verified information from reliable news sources suggests that the text in the tweet is not accurate.\n\nThe image itself does not provide any specific information about the number of casualties, only showing emergency services at a scene, which is consistent with an incident occurring but not with the specific details of the casualties. Therefore, the text's claim of \"at least 18 morts\" (18 deaths) does not align with the verified facts from the external resources.\n\nGiven the significant difference between the reported number of deaths in the original text and the information from credible news sources, the news can be classified as containing a \"False Connection.\" The image is related to an incident in Paris, but the text's claim about the number of deaths is not supported by the external references provided.\n\nFalse Connection",

        "direct_explain": "The image shows a scene with emergency vehicles and police presence, which is consistent with the text reporting at least 18 deaths. The presence of emergency services and law enforcement in the image aligns with what would be expected in the aftermath of an incident resulting in multiple fatalities. There is no clear discrepancy between the text and the image that would indicate misinformation."
