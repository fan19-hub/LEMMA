The distorted valve functions poorly, its flaps swinging apart. Blood that is supposed to be pumped into the body backs up into the heart and lungs.\n\nA vicious cycle ensues: The heart enlarges, so the mitral valve leaks. The leaky mitral valve makes the heart enlarge even more, as it tries to compensate, and heart failure worsens.\n\nIn the new study, a device called the MitraClip was used to repair the mitral valve by clipping its two flaps together in the middle. (The clip is made by Abbott, which funded the study; outside experts reviewed the trial data.)\n\nThe result was to convert a valve that barely functioned into one able to regulate blood flow in and out of the heart.\n\nUntil today, researchers were not sure that fixing the mitral valve would do much to help these patients. A smaller study in France with similar patients failed to find a benefit for the MitraClip.\n\nBut that research included many patients with less severe valve problems, the procedure was not performed as adeptly, and the patients\u2019 medications were not as well optimized as in the new study.\n\nIn the new trial, 614 patients with severe heart failure in the United States and Canada were randomly assigned to receive a MitraClip along with standard medical treatment or to continue with standard care alone.",

People who were taking medication for OCD continued to do so for the trial.\n\nOverall, 38% of the people with the real device responded to the treatment compared with 11% of those with the sham device.

At the fourth month mark, \u201cthe gap was huge\u201d between the texting and control groups, she told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.\n\nTexting also played a role in helping patients feel like they were in control of their treatment, particularly during the first month.\n\nTexting did not affect the odds of developing symptoms of depression.\n\nSurprisingly, the older the patient, the greater the likelihood that she would text back, seeking more information.\n\nOne of the patients texted the program 1,217 times. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s good about this program.

Top of the list: the friendships and conversations in the locker room that are frequent sources of valuable information, connections and motivation. For example, I recently overheard a discussion about Y members and friends of members who had experienced devastating attacks of shingles, including one woman who nearly lost an eye and another who was left with unrelenting nerve pain.\n\nThat was the push I needed to end my procrastination about getting the new shingles vaccine, Shingrix, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration last October after studies involving 16,600 people showed it to be far more effective at preventing this disease than the first shingles vaccine, Zostavax, which I had had a decade earlier. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people 50 and older, including those previously immunized with Zostavax, should now get the Shingrix vaccine.\n\nThe process was surprisingly simple and less costly than I had anticipated (list price is $280 for the two-part shot without insurance). All I needed was a prescription from my doctor. I took it to my local pharmacy, where a staff pharmacist administered the vaccine. I\u2019ll get the second part the same way in May. My Medicare Part D insurance covered it with a $40 co-pay for each part. (The cost may be higher if the vaccine is administered in a doctor\u2019s office, so check first.)\n\nMany millions of Americans, especially those older than 40, are susceptible to an eventual attack of shingles, caused by the very same virus that causes chickenpox. Once this virus, varicella zoster, infects a person, it lies dormant for decades in nerve roots, ready to pounce when the immune system is weakened, say, by stress, medication, trauma or disease. One-third of Americans eventually get shingles, but the risk rises with age, and by age 85 half of adults will have had at least one outbreak of shingles.",

Elevated levels of the proteins can be detected within 15 or 20 minutes of injury. The test can be taken within 12 hours of injury, and results can be obtained within three or four hours.\n\nPatients are currently diagnosed with concussion based on a combination of symptoms as well as imaging. However, CT scans don't always detect concussion.\n\n\"Over 90% of CT scans (for concussion) are negative. And you get 200 times the radiation of a chest X-ray. It's expensive; it's not terrific,\" said Hank Nordhoff, chairman and CEO of Banyan Biomarkers, maker of the new test. It can help determine whether a patient further needs a CT scan, based on a physician's concerns.\n\n\"Today's action supports the FDA's Initiative to Reduce Unnecessary Radiation Exposure from Medical Imaging -- an effort to ensure that each patient is getting the right imaging exam, at the right time, with the right radiation dose,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nRead More",

Both Japanese and American flu patients were included in the trial.\n\nThe experimental drug worked three times faster than another antiviral drug, Tamiflu, the company told the Journal.\n\nThe drug uses a different approach to fight the flu than other medications. The flu virus spreads through the body by invading cells. Once inside a cell, it hijacks the cell's machinery, forcing the cell to make copies of the virus. Then, the newly copied viruses break out of the cell, spreading to other cells nearby and repeating the process.\n\nThis flu season could be worst in a decade\n\nExisting drugs, including Tamiflu, work to block these viral copies from escaping the cell, the Journal reported. The experimental drug, however, kicks into action earlier, working to block the virus from hijacking cells in the first place, the Journal said.\n\nJapanese drug regulators could approve the drug for use in Japan by early March, the Journal reported. The drugmaker plans to apply for approval in the U.S. this summer; however, the drug likely wouldn't be available here until next year.\n\nRead more at The Wall Street Journal.

Koroshetz, director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, said in a statement. \u201cI really cannot overstate the size of this effect.\u201d\n\nThe key finding is that there is often more time than doctors realized in which brain cells can still be rescued by a procedure to remove the clot.

However, the findings do not apply to every stroke victim. The researchers used a special type of brain imaging to identify the patients who still had live brain tissue that could be saved if the blood supply was restored. Only about half the patients who were screened qualified for treatment, known as thrombectomy, which uses a mechanical device to pull clots out of a blood vessel.",

Yet, every medication has side effects, some of which can be worse than the disease they are meant to treat. Drugs considered safe when first marketed can turn out to have hazards, both bothersome and severe, that become apparent only after millions of people take them for a long enough time.\n\nSuch is the case with a popular class of drugs called proton pump inhibitors, or P.P.I.s, now used by more than 15 million Americans and many more people worldwide to counter an increasingly common ailment: acid reflux, which many people refer to as heartburn or indigestion.\n\nThese medications are now linked to a growing number of complications, ranging in seriousness from nutrient deficiencies, joint pain and infections to bone fractures, heart attacks and dementia. While definitive evidence for most of the risks identified thus far is lacking, consumers plagued by acid reflux would be wise to consider an alternative approach, namely diet and lifestyle changes that can minimize symptoms and even heal damage already done.\n\nAcid reflux is more than just a nuisance. It involves the backward flow of stomach acid into the tissues above it. It results when the lower esophageal sphincter, a ring of muscle between the esophagus and the stomach, fails to close tightly enough to prevent the contents of the stomach from moving up instead of down. Sometimes the upper sphincter, between the esophagus and the throat, malfunctions as well.",

Matched with comparable patients who did not have surgery, those who did fared much better physically, emotionally and socially. They rated themselves as healthier and were less likely to report problems with mobility, pain, daily activities, social interactions and feelings of depression and anxiety, among other factors that can compromise well-being.",

This method is expensive, invasive and has some risk of complications,\" study author Dr. Sheraz Markar said in an ECC news release. Markar is from Imperial College London in England.\n\nWith endoscopy, a flexible tube is threaded down a sedated patient's throat to the stomach to view the digestive tract.\n\n\"A breath test could be used as a noninvasive, first-line test to reduce the number of unnecessary endoscopies. In the longer term this could also mean earlier diagnosis and treatment, and better survival,\" Markar said.\n\n\"Because cancer cells are different to healthy ones, they produce a different mixture of chemicals. This study suggests that we may be able detect these differences and use a breath test to indicate which patients are likely to have cancer of the esophagus and stomach, and which do not,\" he explained.\n\nMarkar added that the test needs to be validated in a bigger group before it could be used on patients.

Hoberman is chief of the general academic pediatrics division at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC.\n\nThe study included 520 youngsters with ear infections. The children ranged in age from 9 months to 23 months, and were randomly selected to receive either a standard 10-day course of antibiotics or a shortened five-day course of antibiotics followed by five days of placebos.\n\nThe risk of treatment failure was 34 percent in the five-day group and 16 percent in the 10-day group. What's more, the children in the five-day group didn't have a lower risk of antibiotic resistance or of side effects such as diarrhea or diaper rash.\n\n\"The results of this study clearly show that for treating ear infections in children between 9 and 23 months of age, a five-day course of antibiotic offers no benefit in terms of adverse events or antibiotic resistance,\" Hoberman said.\n\n\"Though we should be rightly concerned about the emergence of resistance overall for this condition, the benefits of the 10-day regimen greatly outweigh the risks,\" he added.\n\nThe study was published Dec. 21 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders has more about ear infections in children.",

Researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina divided a group of 20 healthy adults into two groups. One group was instructed to do two sets of 10-minute breathing exercises, while the other group was told to read a text of their choice for 20 minutes. The subjects\u2019 saliva was tested at various intervals during the exercise. The researchers found that the breathing exercise group\u2019s saliva had significantly lower levels of three cytokines that are associated with inflammation and stress.

In coherent breathing, the goal is to breathe at a rate of five breaths per minute, which generally translates into inhaling and exhaling to the count of six. If you have never practiced breathing exercises before, you may have to work up to this practice slowly, starting with inhaling and exhaling to the count of three and working your way up to six.",

No serious adverse events were reported.\n\nLarger and longer studies are now needed to prove that the twice-daily pill can also reduce severe asthma attacks, known as exacerbations. Novartis believes the medicine could be filed for regulatory approval in around 2019.\n\nPills for asthma used to be standard treatment 40 or 50 years ago, but those older products were often associated with worrying side effects. They have since been replaced by inhalers that deliver small amounts of drugs directly into the lungs.\n\nThe Novartis pill works in a very precise way to block the action of inflammatory cells called eosinophils.\n\nThe latest research, published in the journal Lancet Respiratory Medicine, comes at a time of considerable innovation in asthma care, with the recent launch of new injectable drugs for severe asthma that also target eosinophils.\n\nAt the same time, many drugmakers are developing improved asthma inhalers, including \u201csmart\u201d devices with sensors that monitor use.",

Night milk significantly decreased the rodents\u2019 physical activity, balance and coordination and increased sleep time compared with day milk, the research showed.\n\nMice fed night milk were more inclined to explore open spaces, an indication of reduced anxiety that was comparable to the effects from consuming diazepam, a drug commonly used to treat anxiety in people, the researchers said.\n\nNight milk is rich in tryptophan, a sleep-inducing compound, and melatonin, a hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle, the study said. Researchers in South Korea gave lab mice varying doses of dried milk powder made from cow\u2019s milk collected during the day or night and mixed with distilled water. Analysis of the powders showed the night milk contained 24% more tryptophan and nearly 10 times as much melatonin as the day milk. Two groups of control mice received either injections of diazepam or plain drinking water. The mice underwent a series of tests about an hour after treatments. Mice that got night milk were significantly less active than either the mice fed day milk or water-fed controls. Diazepam-treated mice were the least active. Balance and coordination were measured by the number of falls from a rotating bar during a 20-minute period: Mice fed night milk on average fell four to five times, about twice as often as mice given day milk. Diazepam-treated controls fell about nine times, while the water-fed controls fell twice.

Study participants who drank between less than a cup of coffee and three cups a day had 5% to 9% lower risk of dying than those who drank no coffee. Those who drank more than three cups a day did not see any benefit. The finding was murky, like previous studies, some of which suggested a benefit and some did not.\n\nBut when the researchers looked at coffee consumption only among people who said they never smoked, the relationship became clearer: Those who drank between less than a cup of coffee and three cups a day had 6% to 8% lower risk of dying than noncoffee drinkers.

        "original_post": "Heart researchers have long known that plaques in coronary arteries start out as pimplelike bumps but get waxy and hard and filled with calcium as time passes. Calcium shows up as white flecks in CT scans. The hard plaques are not the dangerous ones \u2014 it is the softer ones that rupture and cause a heart attack. But the amount of calcium in arteries can give a good idea of the presence or extent of coronary artery disease.\n\nDr. Krumholz and Dr. Khurram Nasir, a preventive cardiologist at Baptist Health South Florida, who conceived the new study, reasoned that research on heart scans had not been designed to help doctors make treatment decisions they face today.\n\nCurrent guidelines have vastly increased the number of people who are eligible to take statins. Many people, though, are reluctant to take them. So, the investigators asked, could a scan identify those whose actual risk is lower than what was calculated?\n\nThe study subjects were nearly 4,000 men and women ages 45 to 84 and included blacks, whites, Hispanics and Asians who were recruited in 2000 through 2002. According to today\u2019s guidelines, half had risk scores high enough that a statin would be recommended or should be considered. But guidelines then were more conservative, and in accordance with them, the subjects did not take the drugs. All had heart scans, and half had no calcium visible on the scans. The subjects were followed for 10 years.\n\nIt turned out that the actual incidence of heart attacks or disabling chest pain in those with zero calcium was half or less than what the risk calculator predicted.\n\nFor example, a person who, according to the current risk calculator, has a 12 percent risk of a heart attack in the next decade should take a statin, the guidelines say. But if that person has a calcium score of zero, the actual risk turned out to be 4 percent, below the 7.5 percent threshold for recommending a statin according to the guidelines and below the 5 percent risk for considering a statin.",

Now researchers report that a combination drug already in use for treating certain neurological problems may be a better remedy.\n\nDextromethorphan is a cough suppressant commonly found in over-the-counter cough medicines, and quinidine is a drug used to control heart rhythm disorders. In combination, they are used to treat pseudobulbar affect, a neurological disorder involving involuntary crying or other emotional displays.\n\nThe scientists randomized 152 Alzheimer\u2019s patients to a 10-week course of dextromethorphan-quinidine and 127 to placebo. Researchers then rated them using a well-validated scale that measures aggression and agitation. The study is in the Sept. 22 issue of JAMA.\n\nAggression scores declined to 3.8 from 7.1 in the dextromethorphan-quinidine group and to 5.3 from 7.0 in those who took a placebo. Then the researchers re-randomized those who did not respond to placebo to receive either drugs or placebo, and found similar encouraging results for the drug combination.\n\n\u201cFifty-five percent of the people who were on drugs had a 50 percent reduction in their agitation,\u201d said the lead author, Dr. Jeffrey L.

In actuality, about one in four adults of that age now take statins, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe guidelines, issued by two leading cardiology societies in November 2013, move away from trying to lower cholesterol to particular target levels. Instead, patients are urged to consider statins if they have an overall risk of 7.5 percent of developing a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years. The risk can be calculated using an online tool that considers such factors as gender, age, race, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and smoking status.\n\nThe guidelines were contested almost as soon as they were announced. Critics said that the online calculator greatly overstated a patient\u2019s risk of developing a heart problem and that new guidelines would lead millions of additional people to take statins, exposing them to potential side effects such as muscle pain or damage with little to gain.\n\nThat debate continues with the release of the new studies.\n\n\u201cThese two articles indicate that the new guidelines allow you to treat more people and provide better results at a reasonable cost,\u201d said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale, who was not involved in the studies.\n\nBut some say the studies have too many shortcomings to be persuasive.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they are terribly informative and I don\u2019t think they change our thinking,\u201d said Dr. Steven E.
