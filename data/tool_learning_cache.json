In particular, \"~S\" is false in that row. Look at the second row. Is that a row in which all the premises are true and yet the conclusion false?

What I want to do is, I'm going to keep the third row the same, 0, 0, 1. Let me replace the second row with the second row minus 2 times the third row. So we'll get a 0, we'll get a 1 minus 2, times 0, and we'll get a 2 minus 2, times 1. So that's a 0. Let's replaced the first row with the first row minus the third row.
