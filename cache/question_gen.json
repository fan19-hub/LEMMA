Supermoons are indeed larger than the average full moon, but not to the extreme size shown in this image. This suggests that the image has been digitally altered, which indicates misinformation regarding the appearance of the supermoon in 2012.\n\nExternal sources can better help you make the judgement.

The Great Lakes are a group of five freshwater lakes located on the border between Canada and the United States, far from the Atlantic Ocean where German U-boats operated during WWII.

The presence of heavily armed police suggests a response to a security incident rather than a VIP escort, which typically involves a more formal and less aggressive security detail.

The text on the screen indicates that the location is Martin Place and the name of the cafe is Lindt. While the image does show distressed individuals inside the cafe, there is no visible ISIS flag being held up in the window as claimed by the input text.

There is no visual content in the image that relates to the text about an ancient Portuguese shipwreck or any of the other topics mentioned.

However, the claim that every senator is angrily grilling Mark Zuckerberg specifically about ClickHole's articles not being shared widely on Facebook due to algorithm changes is not supported by the image. The image does not show any interaction between senators and Mark Zuckerberg, nor does it provide evidence of the specific content of the interrogation. Furthermore, the specificity of the claim regarding ClickHole's articles and Facebook's algorithm changes is not something that can be confirmed or refuted by the image alone, and it seems unlikely that such a specific and trivial topic would be the subject of intense scrutiny by every senator in a public interrogation setting.\n\nExternal sources can better help you make the judgement.

However, the claim that it might be a newly discovered species cannot be verified from the image alone and is likely an exaggeration or a speculative statement without any scientific basis.

The graphic looks like it could be a satirical or comedic take rather than an actual promotional material for a segment on a television show. The concept of playing 'shirtless baby oil twister by candle light' on a mainstream television show, especially involving minors, is highly unlikely and inappropriate, suggesting that the text is not a factual report but rather a piece of satire or misinformation.\n\nExternal sources can better help you make the judgement.

This suggests that the document is from a time when voting rights were restricted based on gender and possibly political affiliation. The text provided with the image implies that these restrictions are currently in place, which is misinformation since Colombian women gained the right to vote in 1957, and the country's modern constitution does not restrict voting based on being a 'Republican' or gender.

However, the image does not provide any information regarding housing policies or practices related to segregation or the creation of inclusive spaces for black students. Without additional context or evidence, the image does not confirm the claim made in the text.

The use of the term 'kicking out' is also misleading as it suggests an act of aggression or force, which is not how the transition of power occurs in the United States. The transition of power is a formal and peaceful process, not based on personal goals but on the outcome of an election.

This suggests that there may be an external factor not mentioned in the text that caused the dirt to turn blue, such as a chemical spill or other substance that was previously on the tire or the ground.

The text appears to be satirical or sarcastic in nature, as it suggests that criticism of a political figure's relationship with another world leader is equivalent to attacking the difficulty adult men have in making new friends. This is a misrepresentation of the reasons for media scrutiny. The media's critique of political relationships typically focuses on matters of national interest, foreign policy, and security rather than personal friendship challenges.

However, the 'Buffalo Soldiers' were members of the 10th Cavalry Regiment of the United States Army, formed in 1866, and the term is not associated with the 92nd Infantry Division. The 92nd Infantry Division, known as the Buffalo Division, was an African American segregated unit that served in both World War I and World War II, but they are not the same as the original Buffalo Soldiers. Additionally, the image appears to be colorized, suggesting it is historical and likely from World War II, but without external verification, the specific claim about being photographed in Italy's province of La Spezia, Liguria, cannot be confirmed.

The cartoon depicts a person behind a door labeled 'SAFE SPACE' and a broken sign that reads 'Freedom of speech', which seems to be a commentary on the conflict between safe spaces and free speech.

(0 for no misinformation, 1 for presence of misinformation, 'None' for no original prediction)\n\nYour original reasoning based on that prediction is:\n\nThe text states that the album is real but the covers are not, which implies that the covers are draft versions or concepts that were not used for the actual album. The image appears to be an album cover with a stylized design, which is consistent with the text's claim that it is an unused draft cover. There is no evidence of inconsistency or misinformation between the text and the image.\n\nExternal sources can better help you make the judgement.

(0 for no misinformation, 1 for presence of misinformation, 'None' for no original prediction)\n\nYour original reasoning based on that prediction is:\n\nThe text appears to be a self-deprecating statement about being a quitter, which is a personal trait or behavior. The image, however, shows a group of people looking at a painting or artwork in what seems to be an art gallery or exhibition space. There is no clear connection between the content of the text, which discusses a personal history of quitting, and the image, which depicts an art-related scene. The image neither complements nor provides evidence for the text, leading to the conclusion that the post may contain misinformation due to the inconsistency between the text and the image.\n\nExternal sources can better help you make the judgement.

(0 for no misinformation, 1 for presence of misinformation, 'None' for no original prediction)\n\nYour original reasoning based on that prediction is:\n\nThe image shows a group of people gathered inside what appears to be a mosque, which is a setting relevant to the context of Muslim marriage certificates mentioned in the text. The presence of the logo of 'The Guardian', a reputable news organization, adds credibility to the image. There is no clear discrepancy between the text and the image that would indicate misinformation. The image does not directly confirm the legal change described in the text, but it does not contradict it either, and the association with a known news source suggests that the information is likely to be accurate.\n\nExternal sources can better help you make the judgement.

(0 for no misinformation, 1 for presence of misinformation, 'None' for no original prediction)\n\nYour original reasoning based on that prediction is:\n\nThe image shows Leonardo DiCaprio at a film festival event, which does not provide any evidence or context related to the claim about him handing over Marlon Brando's Oscar, a Picasso, or any other items to the US government as part of a Malaysian money laundering scheme investigation.
