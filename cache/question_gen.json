However, the Pakistan flag consists of a dark green field with a white crescent moon and a five-pointed star at its center, and a vertical white stripe at the hoist side. The lighting in the image does not reflect the white elements of the Pakistan flag, which are a significant part of the flag's design.

The Great Lakes are a group of five freshwater lakes located on the border between Canada and the United States, far from the Atlantic Ocean where German U-boats operated during WWII.
