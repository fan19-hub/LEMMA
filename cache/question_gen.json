The Great Lakes are a group of five freshwater lakes located on the border between Canada and the United States, far from the Atlantic Ocean where German U-boats operated during WWII.

It mentions being at a party, arguing in a new city, and personal details about the author's sex life. The image, however, is a comic strip depicting two different ways people might apply chapstick, with a humorous exaggeration in the second panel. There is no connection between the text and the image, as the text does not mention chapstick or relate to the content of the comic.

Additionally, without external verification of the authenticity of the signatures, it cannot be confirmed that the football was indeed signed by all of the Patriots at the first Super Bowl starting the Brady-Belichick dynasty.
