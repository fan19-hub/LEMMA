Supermoons are indeed larger than the average full moon, but not to the extreme size shown in this image. This suggests that the image has been digitally altered, which indicates misinformation regarding the appearance of the supermoon in 2012.\n\nExternal sources can better help you make the judgement.

The Great Lakes are a group of five freshwater lakes located on the border between Canada and the United States, far from the Atlantic Ocean where German U-boats operated during WWII.

The presence of heavily armed police suggests a response to a security incident rather than a VIP escort, which typically involves a more formal and less aggressive security detail.

There is no evidence in the image itself that identifies this man as Sheikh Man Monis or that he is connected to the #SydneySiege.

The text on the screen indicates that the location is Martin Place and the name of the cafe is Lindt. While the image does show distressed individuals inside the cafe, there is no visible ISIS flag being held up in the window as claimed by the input text. The absence of the ISIS flag in the image, which is a key element of the claim in the text, suggests that the information provided in the text does not accurately reflect what is shown in the image.\n\nExternal sources can better help you make the judgement.

However, the literal splitting of items in half is an unrealistic and impractical way to divide possessions in a divorce settlement, which makes the image appear to be staged or altered for dramatic effect.
