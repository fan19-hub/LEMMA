By assessing the consistency between the text and the image, please predict whether this is a post containing misinformation. Please follow the Rules below:\n\nRules:\nGenerate a JSON object with three properties: 'label', 'explanation' and 'external knowlegde'. \nThe return value of 'label' property should be selected from [\"Real\", \"Fake\"].\n\"Real\" indicates that no misinformation is detected. \n\"Fake\" indicates that misinformation is detected. \nThe return value of 'explanation' property should be a detailed reasoning for the given 'label'. \n\nNote that your response will be passed to the python interpreter, SO NO OTHER WORDS! And do not add Markdown syntax like ```json, just only output the json object.\n\nExample output (JSON):\n{\n    \"label\": 0,\n    \"explanation\": \"The image shows a concert venue filled with people who appear to be enjoying a performance, which is consistent with the text's description of a photo taken at the start of a concert in Paris. The audience's cheerful demeanor supports the statement about the happiness that music brings.
