A news post is consist of text and image. Your task is to predict whether this news article contains misinformation.

Here is the text of this news:

{TEXT}

The image is also provided.

In your previous response, we asked you to predict a label that indicates whether this news article contains misinformation (0 for no misinformation, 1 for presence of misinformation), and your prediction is:

{PREDICTION}

Now, we are providing you additional reference, based on these references, you will decide whether or not to modify your decision.

##### First reference: Knowledge graphs (KG).

You are provided with 2 KGs. The first KG is converted from the text part of the news, while the second KG is converted from the image. The KGs can help you better in sorting out logical relationships, and detect some unmatching/irrational information.

First KG (Converted from Text part):

{TEXT_KG}

Second KG (Converted from Image):

{IMAGE_KG}

##### Second reference: External knowledge and facts.

You are provided with external news/articles/post/wikis that are related to the provided news topics. You can trust the authenticity of these resources and use them as your reference.

Begin of external resources:

{TOOLLEARNING}

End of external resources.

Now you have all the resources, please do verification based on following steps:

Check for inconsistencies between the two Knowledge Graphs (KGs). If found, suspect misinformation in the news; if not, proceed.

Examine if external sources align only with text-based KGs and differ from image-based KGs. If so, be cautious.

Look for external validation supporting entities/relations in the KGs. Lack of validation suggests misinformation; if present, continue.

Confirm if verified details exist in just one KG; if yes, note its limited impact.

Detect sarcasm in images, as it may indicate fake information.

Decide whether to adjust the original prediction based on verification.

Finally, please decide whether or not to modify your original prediction.

In one or more paragraphs, output your reasoning steps. In the final line, use a single binary value (0 or 1) to indicate whether misinformation exists. 0 for no misinformation. 1 for the presence of misinformation. Please don't output any other words except for the binary label on the last line.
