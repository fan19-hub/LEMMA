Your task is the image captioning. Let's think step by step. 
1. If there is text in the image (hand written or print version), extract them. 
2. Determine the type of pictures (photo, statistic chart, or other type). 
3. If photo, describe how many characters are in this pic? what are they doing? what are their relations? what is the background? Imply the topic of this picture. 
If statistic chart, what kind of chart it is? what interesting data does it have? what is the title or purpose of this chart?
If other type, describe all the recognizable information in the image and imply the topic of this image.
