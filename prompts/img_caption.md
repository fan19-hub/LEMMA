Your task is the image captioning. Let's think step by step. 
1. 
- Only when **"English"** text is in the image (hand written or print version), extract them.
- Ohterwise (if Chinese text there), output **None** for this step. Do not explain yourself
2. Determine the type of pictures (photo, statistic chart, or other type). 
3.
- If photo, describe how many characters are in this pic? what are they doing? what are their relations? what is the background? Imply the topic of this picture. 
- If statistic chart, what kind of chart it is? what interesting data does it have? what is the title or purpose of this chart?
- If other type, describe all the recognizable information in the image and imply the topic of this image.
4. 
- If there are some human marks, like a circlethen check if there are something unusual or some details really important to the topic. Based on the marks, try to analyze what the author is trying to express. 

- If there is NO human mark, output **None** for this step.
